        Truly no other word aside from OUTSTANDING. I moved back up north a
        little over a year ago and have been on the search for the best Chinese
        food and truthfully, have found it here. The orange chicken 11/10 the
        sesame chicken 11/10 the pork fried rice 100/10. Don’t get me started on
        the pan friend dumplings. Next i want to mention the quantity vs. price.

        Truly no other word aside from OUTSTANDING. I moved back up north a
        little over a year ago and have been on the search for the best Chinese
        food and truthfully, have found it here. The orange chicken 11/10 the
        sesame chicken 11/10 the pork fried rice 100/10. Don’t get me started on
        the pan friend dumplings. Next i want to mention the quantity vs. price.
        The amount of food you get with one combination plate can serve 2/3
        meals for 1 person. The price is extremely affordable, somewhat shocking
        for the amount and how amazing the food is. Lastly i will state the
        staff. Amazing customer service when taking a take-out order over the
        phone. AND big props to the handsome young gentleman always working the
        register, always has a smile and wonderful vibe! Needless to say - i
        have been ordering takeout from this incredible place 1x a week and will
        continue! YOU should try it too! Best of luck 🤞🏼

        I have been here a few times. The food is good but I had a bad
        experience last time I ordered. I had to wait an extra 25 minutes for my
        order (was suppose to be 30 minutes, ended up being an hour). After I
        got home I realized my order was missing a few items, I reached out to
        the restaurant, call and then wrote them an email explaining what
        happened and asking for a refund for the incomplete order. Now I support
        small business as much as I can but I do not support dishonesty. The
        least the restaurant could have done is refunded me the amount for the
        missing items, even with the long wait, and it would have been fine. I
        will no longer visit this business.

        Incredibly poor service ruined this restaurant for me. Ordered a small
        scorpion bowl to share, a water, a soda, an appetizer, meal, two sushi
        rolls and an order to go. The small scorpion bowl came out in a glass
        with one straw. When I expressed my confusion the waitress said she
        could pour it into a bowl, bring another straw or another small scorpion
        bowl. Don't bother with the small if you're looking to share, it comes
        in a glass. I'm not even sure why they would even bother advertising
        this as a 'bowl.' The meal came out and was finished before the sushi,
        which was ordered as my meal, was ever brought to the table. When we
        finally got the attention of the waitress, we asked for our check and
        our take out, and the waitress stated the WRONG order was being put in
        for us. We then had to pay for our meal at the table and then, go to the
        register immediately afterwards and pay for the take out. The sushi was
        good but, they use the mushy stuff, not the whole fish like I prefer
        with sushi. Also, I noticed that when the guests next to us left, the
        table was not cleaned even after twenty minutes. All in all, I won't be
        returning again anytime soon, if ever. There are better restaurants in
        the area with much better quality and service.

        The crunchy noodles I ordered were not crunchy, they felt old and
        rubbery like they have been sitting all day, the roast pork chow mein
        was weird and tasted like to much beef bullion was used, and the sushi
        was off. I got spicy yellow tuna it had no spice and tastes like cat
        food, the tuna felt dried out and old, the tuna and mango was not good
        either the white rice felt like minute rice and was mush and not even
        packed like you expect white rice to be packed (to the top). This place
        was so good before but now it’s just sad. You can’t dine in anymore and
        the quality in just gone.

        This literally is the best Chinese in CT. I don’t know how they do it
        but the quality and work they put into their dishes is absolutely
        incredible. This food even tops China Town in Boston.
