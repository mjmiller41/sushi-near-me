        First time visit to Sushi Court and will definitely dine in again.
        Everyone was very nice, attentive, and respectful. Food was amazing. My
        wife and I love sushi and Japanese food all around, and have so far been
        unimpressed with many of the other places in Fayetteville. After dining
        in tonight around 8:30, we've found our new go to sushi restaurant. We
        ordered a steak hibachi meal to share as well as two sushi rolls to
        share. The food arrived very shortly after ordering and we were
        astonished (to say the least) at the sizes of the portions. Both of our
        rolls were almost double the size of many other restaurants rolls for
        less than they would've cost at those same restaurants.  Even our shared
        hibachi dish was large enough that we were unable to finish it. The best
        part of the entire experience is that you could taste the freshness of
        the food in each and every bite. For the amount of food that we
        received, and the price of our drinks, we spent less than $50 dollars.
        I've never ordered dinner for two at a Japanese restaurant without
        spending significantly more money than that. All in all, this was a very
        delightful dining experience and we're excited to come back again soon!

        First time visit to Sushi Court and will definitely dine in again.
        Everyone was very nice, attentive, and respectful. Food was amazing. My
        wife and I love sushi and Japanese food all around, and have so far been
        unimpressed with many of the other places in Fayetteville. After dining
        in tonight around 8:30, we've found our new go to sushi restaurant. We
        ordered a steak hibachi meal to share as well as two sushi rolls to
        share. The food arrived very shortly after ordering and we were
        astonished (to say the least) at the sizes of the portions. Both of our
        rolls were almost double the size of many other restaurants rolls for
        less than they would've cost at those same restaurants.  Even our shared
        hibachi dish was large enough that we were unable to finish it. The best
        part of the entire experience is that you could taste the freshness of
        the food in each and every bite. For the amount of food that we
        received, and the price of our drinks, we spent less than $50 dollars.

        I usually order the bento box when I come here, because it fills you up
        quickly and it taste good. Today, I ordered something different. I tried
        the Spicy Seafood Noodles. It was amazing. Another favorite food on the
        menu. I would recommend if you’re a spicy seafood lover.

        P.S. Phenomenal service

        Update your online menu, this is completely irresponsible. I have a
        severe shellfish allergy, having gone into anaphylaxis once before in my
        life.


        Placed an order over the phone via this online menu.

        I ordered the crunchy salmon roll.

        I took a bite in the car.

        Mouth started tingling.

        Finished my errands, got home, went to take a second bite and
        immediately spit out what was IMITATION CRAB. Nowhere is this listed.
        Not all imitation crab is shellfish free and clearly this isn’t.


        When I called, the lady who answered said “yeah, so our menu shows that
        there’s crab stick in it.  Oh, anyways yeah you can have my manager.”


        The manager was just as helpful as she was.

        Forget the wasted money this place is refusing to return, UPDATE YOUR
        MENU FOR THE SAFETY OF OTHERS. Completely irresponsible.


        Edit; So it took the manager talking to the owner to exercise any sort
        of wherewithal in how to handle a situation such as this. Received a
        call back after writing this review where refund or store credit was
        offered after I was made sure the entire staff is just so sorry about
        this (yeah I’m sure the one who answered the phone and told me I was
        lying was real apologetic, lol!)

        Then I was told I need to inform staff of my allergies. Absolutely.
        Totally fair. Normally I do. Especially when ordering something stating
        there is imitation crab. Call me uncultured but I’ve lived with this
        allergy for 34 years and in the history of a tuna roll or salmon roll
        explicitly called that, there is never crab anything. Sure, rolls with
        tuna and crab plus other things exist. But they aren’t called a tuna
        roll. Or a salmon roll.


        Anyways, an extra star for trying but still pitiful all around.

        I had high hopes for this restaurant based on its excellent ratings, but
        my experience with the Beef Ramen was disappointing. I expected either
        Chinese-style wheat noodles or soba noodles, but instead, it was made
        with instant Top Ramen-like noodles. Although the noodles were delivered
        separately from the soup, they were overcooked and soggy. The bulgogi
        was underwhelming, lacking flavor and featuring limited meat.
        Additionally, the egg was overcooked, and the vegetables were mushy.


        I also tried the steamed gyoza, which initially looked enticing.
        However, I quickly realized they were water-boiled instead of properly
        steamed, resulting in a pool of water at the bottom of the container
        that made the gyoza tasteless. The dipping sauce, while sweet, missed
        the mark on the savory flavor I expected.


        My co-worker ordered the Bento with Chicken and Shrimp, and while I
        can’t offer a full review on that dish, she expressed her
        dissatisfaction. Before I make a final judgment on the restaurant, I
        plan to give Sushi Court another chance. It’s possible today was just an
        “off” day or that dining in person could offer a better experience than
        ordering through DoorDash. Hopefully, I’ll have a better experience next
        time.

        Sushi Court isn't super large, but it is really cute and authentic
        looking inside. The food was absolutely amazing. I had the chicken ramen
        bowl and steamed dumplings, and my boyfriend had me so soup and a Bento
        Box. Both dishes had portion sizes large enough to fill us up as well as
        take some home. Probably one of the better ramen places I've had here in
        Fayetteville.
