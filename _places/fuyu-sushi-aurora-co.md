        I don’t normally write reviews, a live and let live kind of guy, but had
        to step in here as we chose Fuyu as it was a 4.8 on Google and a 4.5 on
        Yelp.. I have had the privilege of eating very good sushi (Nobu and
        alike) as well as your smaller strip mall sushi places to scratch the
        itch at an economic price.  I don’t expect anything more than halfway
        decent service and ok sushi from the itch scratchers,  so my
        expectations were not high, but wound up extremely disappointed none the
        less.  I ordered online and got an email response to pick up 30 min
        later. I arrived about 35 min later and was told it was not ready and I
        sat with two others to wait.  Bags came out and they would walk by to
        put bags in the shelf and go back to the kitchen with asking any of us
        if the order was ours to the point where I got up to ask them to check. 
        That helped the other two as their orders were out, but I still waited. 
        An hour and 10 min after I placed the order, I was finally on my way
        with a gratuitous 8 oz Cherry Vodka drink for my patience.

        When I got home 15 min later found that the soy sauce they packed
        spilled in the bag and covered my front seat of my new car.  Cleaned up
        and went inside to eat to find the fish to be a disappointment.  The
        rice was soggy and clumped together, see picture, as we just ate the
        sushi off the top.  The discoloration of the sashimi was concerning
        enough to dump it.   If you correlate sweet shrimp with raw ebi, don’t
        here, you get cooked shrimp when you order sweet shrimp.

        As I had time to observe while in the restaurant, it seemed like they
        had regulars based on greetings, and it was probably at half capacity..
        so I don’t know if my experience was the exception but thought I needed
        to share in case it was the norm and needed to warn those who expect a
        little more from their sushi experience.

        This sushi restaurant offers a great price for high-quality sushi. The
        fish is incredibly fresh, cut thickly, and bursting with flavor. I also
        love their uni creamy udon, but unfortunately, it’s not always
        available, which makes it a bit of a hit or miss. I would highly
        recommend this sushi place.

        Incredible sushi place!

        My daughter and I came in for some lunch and had a great experience.

        The sushi was fresh and the restaurant was very clean. The sushi was
        well made and the rolls were large.

        We have eaten at a lot of sushi places and will definitely be returning
        to this one!

        I highly recommend Fuyu Sushi.
