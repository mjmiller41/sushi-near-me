        Been here twice; food always good. Servers make sure to check back after
        two minutes or two bites ;) Also keep and eye out for empty drinks! The
        happy hour pricing is right up my ally! This is our fave sushi place in
        St. Cloud so far!  My two children always ask to go back

        Excellent food. Very busy place. Personally, I did not like sushi prior
        to eating it here. Like everything else, you may surprise yourself by
        trying a food one more time to see if you like it. Quality was
        fantastic, taste was fabulous, and satisfaction was fenomenal (Yes, I
        know it is spelled phenomenal, but I was on a roll). Speaking of roll,
        the sushi I tried was Spicy Girl. It wasn't really spicy, but it  had a
        great flavor, and the topping was so crunchy. I can't believe I forgot
        to get a picture of the sushi. Everyone enjoyed their meals. It's
        definitely a place worth going back to!

        The food here is always great. We especially love the sweet potato roll!
        It can get busy during happy hour, and there aren't a lot of servers, so
        we have to wait for our check longer sometimes. Overall we highly
        recommend.

        Great servers, very attentive to anything we needed. I did not like the
        miso soup, but it could be the recipe because the tofu was nice and
        soft, but the (seaweed, kelp, large thick leaves?)  was the only thing I
        could taste. The gyoza was good nothing special, but the sauce was very
        good. The spring rolls (can't remember what they were called on the
        menu) were fantastic. The crisp flakeyness and VERY hot and fresh
        veggies inside was incredible, highly recommend this. The Philly rolls
        were very good, the spicy yellowtail was fine but not very spicy and the
        yellowtail wasn't a very prominent flavor. I was surprised how much I
        liked the special veggie rolls. I wasn't sure about the toasted coconut
        flakes on top, but it seemed to only add a crunchyness and not the
        sweetness I expected. The layers of crunchy coconut, soft rice and
        veggie, then a fried crunchy center was a great texture and very worth
        the premium price. The veggie rice with yumyum sauce was honestly one of
        the best things on the table. The creamy sauce and creamy (almost oily?
        In a very good way) rice was everything I hoped for with that dish.
        Great ratio of veggies to rice and something I'm going to order again.

        Finally the tempura cheesecake! Really good. It would've been perfect
        with a slightly more crispy fried exterior, but otherwise heavenly. The
        cheesecake itself was velvety and creamy, the crust inside was crunchy
        but still soft. There was also a little ball of frozen cheesecake in the
        center, which I think was intentional because it ended up being like
        fried ice cream. Definitely going here again.
