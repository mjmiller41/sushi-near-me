        My fiancé brought me to The Oceanaire Seafood Room for my birthday. The
        experience was wonderful. They gave me a special greeting at the door
        and included another birthday message printed in my menu. On top of
        that, they provided me with a signed birthday card and made me feel
        incredibly special. The food was excellent, starting with a full order
        of the crab cakes. Hands down the best I’ve ever had. I followed this
        with a main course of the Blue Crab “Louie” Capellini that was
        delicious. My fiancé ordered the 16oz. New York Strip Steak with a side
        of Truffle Potatoes that were out of bounds. The meal ended with a
        surprise birthday Flaming Baked Alaska that was the perfect end to a
        phenomenal meal. The service was top notch and only one minor flaw of
        delivering one crab cake when I ordered two. The issue was fixed
        promptly. Thank you to all who made my night unforgettable!

        My fiancé brought me to The Oceanaire Seafood Room for my birthday. The
        experience was wonderful. They gave me a special greeting at the door
        and included another birthday message printed in my menu. On top of
        that, they provided me with a signed birthday card and made me feel
        incredibly special. The food was excellent, starting with a full order
        of the crab cakes. Hands down the best I’ve ever had. I followed this
        with a main course of the Blue Crab “Louie” Capellini that was
        delicious. My fiancé ordered the 16oz. New York Strip Steak with a side
        of Truffle Potatoes that were out of bounds. The meal ended with a
        surprise birthday Flaming Baked Alaska that was the perfect end to a
        phenomenal meal. The service was top notch and only one minor flaw of
        delivering one crab cake when I ordered two. The issue was fixed
        promptly. Thank you to all who made my night unforgettable!

        Came for a double date night during restaurant week. Everything was
        amazing 🤩. I did the restaurant week menu with the lobster bisque,
        swordfish, whipped truffle potatoes, and chocolate cake. All of it was
        SO good. I also tried my husbands sweetheart sushi roll and sea bass
        dish. Both were incredible. The garlic green beans and truffle fries
        were also really delicious. It is a pricy restaurant, but the service is
        great and it’s a gorgeous restaurant. We will be back for special
        occasions, or during another restaurant week when it is more affordable.

        Everything was amazing. We did the winter special for 2. The bacon
        mussels were out of this world (and I do not like mussels) the steak was
        absolutely the best steak I've ever had. The truffle potatoes were
        amazing. The lobster tail was cooked to perfection. The deserts were,
        wow. Highly recommend, oh we went on a birthday so we also got this
        amazing desert lit on fire too. Everything was extremely great quality.

        Shout out to chuck! My husband and I visited last night for our first
        time and he was very informative, friendly and got us anything we
        needed.


        There are new menus printed daily since they get their seafood flown in
        daily so this review is from January 11 2025.


        We started with a unique appetizer platter and bread and butter. We
        snacked on olives, carrots, celery and pickles. The oysters Rockefeller
        was really good, the potstickers were also good but they could have been
        better, it had kimchi and they had a little kick to them. Which we
        liked. The patronarita was delicious! Along with the spicy pineapple
        margarita.


        Our entrees were pretty solid as well, I really liked the creamed corn
        and the seafood mix grill. His favs were the 10oz filet and the hash
        brown a la oceanaire.


        Overall we had a good experience, but I wish the music would have been a
        bit lower. The servers, and even the manager, were checking in, cracking
        jokes, and making any adjustments as needed. I loved it, such a
        wonderful service experience worth every penny.

        It was a delightful experience to have with a wonderful group of
        friends. I enjoyed the food, the staff was informative and the food was
        very delicious. My friends had sword fish and steak and were amazed.  I
        had steak and shrimp.  We shared 3 different desserts.  All around
        amazing and fun to watch the baked Alaska...
