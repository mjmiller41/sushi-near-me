        My girlfriend and I had a wonderful experience eating at Neveyah! The
        sushi was absolutely divine, it was so fresh and delicious. I ordered
        the Orlando Pride roll and she got the Barbie roll!


        We had coconut shrimp as our appetizer and also ordered the tomato
        pepper steak stir fry and the Thai fried rice (none of which are
        pictured because we were too busy enjoying them!)


        The desserts were beautifully presented and the red bean paste ice cream
        was some of the best I have ever had. My girlfriend got the bread
        pudding and loved it!


        We will definitely be returning in the future!

        My girlfriend and I had a wonderful experience eating at Neveyah! The
        sushi was absolutely divine, it was so fresh and delicious. I ordered
        the Orlando Pride roll and she got the Barbie roll!


        We had coconut shrimp as our appetizer and also ordered the tomato
        pepper steak stir fry and the Thai fried rice (none of which are
        pictured because we were too busy enjoying them!)


        The desserts were beautifully presented and the red bean paste ice cream
        was some of the best I have ever had. My girlfriend got the bread
        pudding and loved it!


        We will definitely be returning in the future!

        This is a spot I'm so glad I finally checked out! I have lived in
        Orlando most of my life and had the pleasure of trying a lot of Asian
        cuisine. Neveyah ia a top five spot for me, now.


        Let me start with the sashimi. My work background is in high-end
        Japanese restaurants (think Zuma) and the quality of this fish is on par
        if not better. We had maguro, sake, and hamachi sashimi. The thickness
        of each slice is more than I have seen anywhere, a nice treat. 🍣


        The sushi was also excellent. Well rolled, very fresh ingredients, and
        the rice was so sticky. 🍚


        My dinner buddy has never had Japanese A5 wagyu so we did the hot stone
        and that was divine! 🥩


        I had chicken pad thai (medium spice was a solid punch of heat, nothing
        too crazy) and it was delightful. The portions were large but not
        overwhelming. My buddy had the Panang Curry and got it Thai hot. He was
        sweating but ate it all, that's how flavorful it was! 🍲


        Tammy was our waitress and she was very friendly. I look forward to
        coming with my family and friends again! 🥢

        Service was great. The crab Rangoon filling was amazing. The calamari
        was fresh and perfectly fried. The house sweet chili sauce wasn’t great,
        lacking in flavor and brought down both the appetizers they served it
        with. We ordered the New York New York, the B52 roll and the fire
        starter. All the rolls were delicious, but the fire starter was amazing.

        The atmosphere was nicely lit and inviting. The staff were welcoming. I
        took a bite into this egg roll  that was ordered and I think it was the
        best I have had. I definitely will be back for the full menu.

        Great meal. Lisa, our server (and I think the manager that night) was
        very attentive. The sushi was delicious. I got the pineapple stir fry
        rice with steak and it was great too. My only complaint was that the
        food for our table (3 people) didn’t come out at the same time. Lisa and
        her team made up for it, though because she heard that we were there for
        my wife’s birthday, and they brought out a lovely dessert with a song.
        Excellent night out. Give it a try!!
