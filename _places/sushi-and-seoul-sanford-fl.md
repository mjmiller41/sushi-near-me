        WOW!  The food here is amazing!  Not your typical sushi only spot.  I
        had the crispiest chicken wings that I have ever had in my life and they
        were perfectly cooked.  The avocado tower was amazing and fresh!  The
        crispy fried chicken thigh was to die for.  And the presentation was
        amazing.  Everything was fresh and delicious!  I told Al he needed to go
        on Master Chef as he would definitely win.  Thank you for the amazing
        food!  I can't wait to bring my friends and family in for all the
        deliciousness!

        Wow, this place is incredible! Everything we had tonight for dinner was
        an absolute treat. Such bold flavors and a beautiful presentation. It is
        truly a fantastic dining experience! Plus, a beer or two from Celery
        City Craft was fantastic. We will surely be back! Another foodie
        adventure in the books.

        For my money, this is probably the best spot in town to grab a little
        Japanese food and a beer! I have been 4x over the last several months
        and left beyond satisfied every time. The tuna tower is epic, and even
        if it doesn't look huge in the photo, once you mix everything up, it
        fills up the bowl it's served in and was quite filling (and tasted
        incredible)! The volcano roll was excellent, and I think my favorite
        thing on the whole menu is the chicken karaage, because you get an
        absolute MOUNTAIN of crispy on the outside, moist on the inside fried
        chicken served over rice with spicy mayo, and it's so good I've ordered
        it twice!


        The dudes who run the show aren't the friendliest people I've ever
        encountered, but they're busy, so I never really let it bother me. All
        in all, the fact that you can get an amazing meal, served with a $4 pint
        of high quality craft beer, and enjoy it on their lovely patio make this
        a can't-miss stop if you're in the area, though, I wouldn't recommend
        going during peak dinner hours, because based on other reviews I've
        read, they tend to get overwhelmed by orders quickly, and they don't
        appear to handle the rush very well. Go when it's quiet and you are in
        for a treat!

        The service is the worst experience in the world. The man serving seemed
        displeased, poor service and not at all friendly. The sushi and salmon
        bowl were good.
