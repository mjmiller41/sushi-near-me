        I can truly appreciate why this place garners such glowing reviews. I
        savored an array of delightful drinks, and after just one colossal
        20-ounce frozen margarita, I felt as if I had enjoyed the effects of
        five! It was an incredible value for such a tasty treat. Every dish was
        remarkable, from the perfectly crispy shrimp egg rolls to the
        tantalizing sushi rolls, and the Bangkok fried rice was an absolute
        standout. I wholeheartedly recommend this gem of a restaurant.


        The ambience was warm and inviting, with soft lighting and a vibrant
        atmosphere that made the experience even more enjoyable. The staff was
        attentive and friendly, creating a welcoming environment that set the
        tone for a fabulous evening. Whether you're looking for a romantic date
        night, a lively ladies' night out, or even a solo adventure at the bar,
        this place fits the bill perfectly. It has such a cool vibe that I can’t
        wait to return next week for more unforgettable moments!

        Let’s talk about EAV That & Sushi real quick. I’ve never really been a
        Thai food eater. I’ll eat it if that’s what the majority wants but I’ve
        never been the one to have to have it. Baby listen, EAV That & Sushi has
        me in a choke hold as the food is AMAZNG!!!!


        We were in the area as Shaunie said it is one of her favorite places to
        go, as such, we went. Walking in, the ambiance is really low key and has
        a great feel to it. It’s perfect for friends, dates, or even alone.
        After we walked in we were able to be seated immediately. Continuing to
        take in the ambiance, the feel was so chill. There was a game on each
        television and the music was playing in the background. Yep, I’m here
        for all of this.


        Upon taking our seats, I ordered a sweet tea and began to scroll the
        menu.


        Taking a moment to take in the menu as there are an abundance of
        options, I decided on the Spring Rolls as an Appetizer and Pad Thai as
        my Main Course. Clearly I played it safe. 😂😂😂


        From seating us to taking out drink and food orders, our waiter was
        super nice. He was professional, very educated on the menu offerings and
        kept a smile the entire time. Not to mention, we weren’t his only table
        yet he was on top of his game and provided top tier service.


        Once my food came I was immediately drawn into the aroma. The Thai
        Spices mixed with the Sweet smells of the sauce made me extra happy
        inside. LoL.


        The Spring Rolls were good. They were crunchy loo

        Upon first bite I almost melted. Whew! I have NEVER in all my years had
        a Pad Thai this amazing. I’m talking about perfectly cooked noodles.
        Optimum noodle to meat to sauce ratio. And best of all, the peanuts were
        coated in the sauce and not only acted as the extra layer of texture,
        but their flavor profile was enhanced which allowed the dish to have a
        multi-flavor blend of sweet, salty, and nutty. Omggggggg. I want
        moreeeeeeeeee.


        The dish arrived hot and was very fresh. This wasn’t no quick boil or
        reheated dish, no. This was freshly made when I ordered it and whoever
        the chef was is amazing at their job.


        Dear Chef, your ability to cook Pad Thai is beyond normal. Your
        supernatural flavor elevated dish was exciting, mouth pleasing, and has
        made me eager to return to EAV That & Sushi.


        If you’re in the area and ready to eat, you can not go wrong with EAV
        That & Sushi.

        It's been over two years since I've been to EAV T&S -- Has always been
        one of my favorite spots to treat myself, family and friends as the
        atmosphere is always welcoming and it's intimate. Went in today and as
        always, the food and service did not disappoint. Continues to be
        consistent and delicious. Our (my daughter and I) server was Dennis and
        he was incredibly attentive.


        I remain a fan...And now that we are less than 15 mins. away, will be
        coming in more often and will continue to tell any and all about this
        East Atlanta gem...

        The food and drinks are so good. All food is fresh, full of flavor and
        made to order. The bartenders make the best drinks. My favorite server
        is Love. She is so nice and professional. This is my new favorite Thai
        spot. The Thai basil fried rice with shrimp & add salmon is my favorite.
        Coconut soup delicious as well. 10/10 highly recommend

        I have eaten here twice, once Thai takeout and once ordering sushi in
        the restaurant. The Thai food was pretty expensive for the amount, but
        it was decent.

        The sushi experience was not pleasant. The interior was dark, a little
        small, and incredibly loud. It was difficult to hear our server and the
        other side of the table. We ordered the sushi and sashimi combo, and
        there were only three types of fish. Salmon, Tuna, and 1 white fish. It
        seemed like they were out of most sushi options. The Tuna was frozen,
        and the salmon on the roll was discolored (the brown in the photo is not
        soy sauce). Really disappointing evening.
