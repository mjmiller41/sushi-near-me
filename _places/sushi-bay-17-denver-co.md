        This is your old reliable local sushi restaurant. Some people compare
        this place to restaurants downtown, there's no comparison this is a
        local cheap sushi restaurant if you want fine dining this isn't the
        place. A really nice patio area out front if you want to dine in but
        they also do great take away.


        Staff is always very friendly and helpful.

        The sushi was fresh and tasty, and they had a good selection of sake,
        wine, and beer to pair with the food. The service is prompt and
        efficient. The atmosphere is as serene as one would expect from Japan.
        It's a great place to go and relax while you enjoy your food. Parking is
        mostly along the street, but there is a small lot next door that opens
        up after 5 p.m. Don't park there before 5 p.m.! The business next door
        owns that lot.

        So, It’s been about 6 years or so since I’ve been here. The patio is
        pretty nice. I saw the sashimi price and thought it priced very cheap so
        I thought I’d give it a try. I was very disappointed. The fish is 1/3
        the size of what you typically get for $10 around downtown. Those salmon
        & tuna slices in my pic are extremely small, even for $6. I looked at
        some of the nigiri pics in the reviews and the fish cuts were much
        better than what we had. The smoked salmon was NOT fresh. The salmon
        jalapeño roll was so disproportionate when it came to jalapeño/fish. It
        was like I was eating a ball of peppers.

        We will definitely not be coming back. There’s just too many awesome
        sushi places downtown that blow this one out of the water.


        Service was good and the waitress was attentive. She did have a bad case
        of RBF though.


        -Put a smile on your face it goes a long way.

        We enjoyed this sushi restaurant.  The sushi was fresh and the rolls
        were a good size for the price.  Definitely more on the Americanized
        sushi, lots of California roll variations and not too much raw fish that
        isn’t fried.  Definitely a crowd pleaser.
