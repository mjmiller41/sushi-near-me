        We have been stopping in for the past few months anytime we are in the
        area. The food is consistently good, very fresh and the restaurant is
        cozy & very clean!!  We have been lucky enough to have Ricky as our
        bartender each time we have visited. He is so friendly & his menu item
        recommendations have been very helpful!! You won’t be disappointed.
        Can’t wait to have another lunch date here soon!

        I recently dined at Sakari Sushi, and I can confidently say it was an
        amazing experience from start to finish! The sushi was absolutely
        delicious, fresh, and beautifully presented. Each roll was a perfect
        blend of flavors that left us wanting more.


        What truly made our visit special was our waiter, Jon. He was incredibly
        accommodating and went above and beyond to ensure we had a great meal.
        His knowledge of the menu was impressive, and he provided excellent
        recommendations based on our preferences. It was clear he genuinely
        cares about his customers’ experience.


        The ambiance of the restaurant was inviting, making it a perfect spot
        for a special night out or a casual meal. I can't wait to return to
        Sakari Sushi and enjoy more of their fantastic food and service. Highly
        recommend!

        Atmosphere seemed nice, and girls at takeout counter were great…we did
        not eat inside, just got to-go. Sushi rolls were amazing, fresh and
        tasty. See pics.

        Exceptional quality of food and service. One of the best sushi
        restaurants in Orlando area. Service is excellent, everyone is friendly
        and welcoming. Fish is always fresh, sushi is delicious. We ordered two
        of the chefs special rolls. Lemon flavored is my favorite, I had to come
        back here twice for the lemon roll. Overall 10/10, will definitely come
        back.

        Our very favorite place to get sushi - recently refreshed, inside has a
        clean, modern vibe, or there is an outdoor space as well. We often order
        and pick up to eat at home - always fresh and delicious. If you are
        headed to Regal for a movie or just wanting to shop at all the cute
        shops at this completely refreshed outdoor mall, make sure to stop by
        here for lunch or dinner. New on the menu and totally a must try are the
        Brussels sprouts with peach balsamic glaze. Service is always spot on
        and incredibly accommodating.
