        We were searching for some good hibachi and decided to try this place.
        The atmosphere is bland and run down. The sushi was pretty awful. The
        hibachi chicken was pretty decent. I would probably not go back. It was
        pricey for the quality of food. Lastly, there was no detailed bill. It
        was all just written on a piece of paper.

        I was SCAMMED!!


        I am VERY angry to say the least. So my fiance, our daughter, and I went
        here to get hibachi. We ordered a steak hibachi, salmon hibachi, a spicy
        salmon roll and a spicy crab roll.


        The man who did the hibachi was amazing, you could tell he loved his
        job.


        The waitress  however, she was very lack luster. We didn’t even bother
        ordering more than our water because she only checked on us once. Then
        by the end she put the check in front of us and didn’t even ask if we
        were done or anything. So we decided to just call it and pay. I put my
        card in and gave it back to her, I should have given it a better look
        but she charged us $93!!!!!


        So when I got the receipt I was in shock. I caught her attention when
        she passed by and asked for the paper she wrote our order on, which she
        never showed us. She went over to the cash register and calculated it.
        She still had my card meanwhile and voided the 93, and charged me 68.35.
        Which was still wrong but I had had enough at this point. We did tip
        because of the guy who did our hibachi. So we ended paying 80. BUT when
        walking out, on her register I saw 63.28 which was the actual total for
        our food after looking at all the prices online. I understand tax but
        there’s no way it could be an extra 5$. I am DISGUSTED. I  was almost
        SCAMMED out of more money!! I feel scammed to have even paid 80!!! It
        was no honest mistake either. You don’t just overcharge someone and do
        it again. She would have let us walk away knowing we over paid.

        I put a picture of both the hibachi guy and our waitress.

        The restaurant is next to a supermarket. So there are plenty free
        parking. Recommend to come after a whole day at the Hershey’s Park. The
        servings are large. Both the kids’ meal and the regular meal.


        We only tried the Black Dragon roll and the TNT roll. Recommend both of
        them. The ell combo is worth to try, eel is fresh, soft, and tender.
        Kids’ meal is large, enough for an adult in my opinion.


        The service people are nice to us… they also speak mandarin and
        recommended us several food options.


        We will come back whenever we go to the Hershey park.

        Was sat immediately and ordered quickly. My girlfriend and I both order
        hibachi, and our soup and salad came out within 10 minutes. It took
        another 30-40 minutes to get our meals.


        From when we get our soup and salad to when we got our meals, no one
        checked on us, and our drinks were finished before we got our meals.


        When we got our meals, my tuna was dry and overcooked, and there were no
        sauces (aside from soy sauce) to cut the dryness. My girlfriend got the
        lobster, scallop, shrimp hibachi and she said some pieces were cold.


        After being served we did not get refills on drinks. Had to ask for the
        check and never got our box.


        My girlfriend noted that our server, a young boy, seemed to be left
        alone in his duties, which might explain the service.
