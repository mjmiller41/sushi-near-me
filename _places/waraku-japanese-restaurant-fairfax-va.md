        My literal go to sushi spot EVERY TIME. They’ve always had the best
        quality🩷 My entire family has ordered from here for different occasions
        and picked up amazing food.


        After reading another review, from my personal case, they staple the
        bags to make sure nothing falls otw home, and I’ve never missed a
        soup/salad on the side!

        quality🩷 My entire family has ordered from here for different occasions
        and picked up amazing food.


        After reading another review, from my personal case, they staple the
        bags to make sure nothing falls otw home, and I’ve never missed a
        soup/salad on the side!

        Our favorite sushi place.


        CONTEXT:


        We live close to Waraku and have ordered takeout from here at least six
        times a year since they opened. For comparison, we also occasionally get
        sushi from other local places (Ariake on 236 and Blue Ocean), dining in.


        PRICE/VALUE:


        We order by phone, always getting the 3-roll lunch special, and pick up
        in store. Doing it this way, three generous rolls, a pint of miso soup
        and a small salad run $17 per person, which is a screaming deal in the
        DMV. Waraku also has run a fantastic gift card deal in the past where
        you buy one card for $300 and get a second $300 card for free! We are a
        large family so we took advantage of this and used up the balance over
        the course of one year. [I have noticed that a lot of the negative
        reviews complaining about value for price are from people who ordered
        through a meal delivery service, which jacks up the prices considerably.
        So take that into account.]


        QUALITY:


        The fish is always fresh. The ratio of filling to rice is large. The
        fish won't always be a single cut of tuna or salmon, but for the price I
        think that's totally reasonable. In the easily 20+ times we have ordered
        from Waraku, we have never had a bad experience.


        ATMOSPHERE:


        Some reviewers have noted that the in-restaurant experience isn't the
        best. We've only eaten in store once, and it's true that it's not as
        upscale an experience as we get at Ariake or Blue Ocean ... but the
        price is correspondingly lower so we appreciate it. I'd rather continue
        to get affordable takeout from Waraku than see its dining room upgraded.


        BOTTOM LINE:

        100% recommend for takeout. Call them and order over the phone for the
        best price (the online services tack on fees even if you pick up
        yourself).

        Worst fried rice I have ever ordered. Ordered the pineapple chicken
        fried rice and not a single piece of pineapple was found. Also, the
        chicken looked like it was boiled (pale) and overall it was bland to
        boot. I ended up heating up the wok and fixing it myself.


        Do yourself a favor and order something else…

        Food is top notch compared to other sushi spots in NOVA or DC. They have
        authentic sushi rolls that aren’t overloaded on rice, good ginger, and
        less sodium soy sauce comes with takeout which is rare. Highly recommend
        the fried rice, comes with plenty of meat. Has been one of the best
        takeout Japanese we’ve had in a while.

        Check your order they will omit soup n salad if you don't ask them if
        they've included it. They staple the bag so you can't look inside to
        confirm. And the manager is fairly grumpy/moody when you come to get
        your order. Sushi chef very pleasant and makes great rolls. They just
        don't give you what you've paid for.
