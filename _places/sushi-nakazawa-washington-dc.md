        The sushi is so fresh.  Their fish products are air shipped directly
        from Japan.  It was the best sushi we had in the US.  Every single piece
        was carefully crafted.

        I was so excited to try Sushi Nakazawa because of its Michelin star and
        raving reviews, but I was thoroughly disappointed, to say the least. Out
        of all the omakases I’ve tried, this was pretty a pretty subpar
        experience.


        While the fish was extremely fresh and high quality, and every bite was
        truly delicious, the positives end there. Once you get to this price
        point, you’re not just paying for the food anymore, you’re paying for
        the experience. And spoiler alert, you won’t get that here.


        The service was extremely lackluster, especially from the moment you
        walk in. They seriously need to reconsider whoever they have working the
        front desk. She was extremely unwelcoming and frankly, just outright
        rude. We walked in and were not even greeted before we received a cold
        “do you want me to take your jacket.” Really? Our waiter on the other
        hand was very friendly and helpful with drink selections.


        Also, the chefs were extremely distant, if that makes sense. For every
        bite, they would serve you the piece and then mutter the name quietly,
        leaving you to wonder what exactly you were eating. I paid extra for the
        sushi bar to get a personal “experience” with the chefs, but honestly I
        would’ve had the same experience at a table with how impersonal it felt.
        I’ve had a much more intimate and interactive omakase at places that
        cost half the price here. And considering it has a Michelin, I think
        it’s completely unacceptable and undeserved. You leave not learning a
        single thing about any piece you’ve eaten, not their names, ingredients,
        or origin. You might get the fish name, if you can hear the chef.


        One other qualm I have is that, while delicious, I feel like the nigiri
        here is quite boring. There was nothing truly “extraordinary” or
        “creative” about the dishes served here. Every piece eventually just
        tasted the same. Same rice, same sauce, just a different type of fish
        for every bite. However, I’m aware this may just be more of a
        “traditional” type of omakase, so I’m not deducting any stars for this
        reason. Just something to keep in mind. If you’re looking for a
        contemporary take on sushi or just more creative innovations, look
        elsewhere, because you won’t find it here.

        WOW!!!!! This restaurant is the epidemy of fine dining in DC!


        The service itself was phenomenal - all four servers manning the dining
        room very present, engaged and circulated each of the tables with great
        precision. Each table setting was reset prior to the upcoming setting -
        used dishes were removed, beverages were refilled and tables were wiped
        down. Never once did I feel I had to hunt someone down - there was
        always a server eager to answer a question or assist with a request.


        The food was also TOP notch! I ordered the classic omakese w/ one added
        supplement. While there is an upgraded version of the omakase available
        I thought the classic was PERFECT! The flights were well planned,
        appropriately spaced out, and delicious. All in all, I fully intended to
        return to Sushi Nakazawa in the near future. The wine by the glass
        selection is also amazing - while expensive for the amount poured, the
        quality of the every wine served in unbeatable.


        A few tips to share with future diners. Online reservations are not
        released at the same time for solo diners as are for tables with 2+
        diners. Solo diners may make there reservations online about a week
        prior to their preferred date. Wine portions by the glass are VERY small
        - each pour may be at most 4 ounces - so if you intend to drink more
        than 8 ounces of wine/sake I would highly suggest ordering a full bottle
        instead - it will save you a tone of one at the end of the meal.
        Personally I would opt for the sushi table experience versus the dining
        room experience. While yes you do see the staff preparing each piece
        live, the entertainment value of the sushi table isn't that marginal
        compared to the regular dining experience.

        Every bite was a masterpiece and as soon as we walked in we were
        captivated. The ambiance was refined, and the service was impeccable.
        The curated selection or delicate pieces showcased incredible artistry
        and a deep understanding of flavor. Each piece was a shocase of textures
        and tastes. This is sushi culinary genius. This is hands down a top tier
        sushi experience.

        Excellent Omakase, we sat at the counter which was a fun experience. At
        $190 for the regular Omakase, we enjoyed a great variety and a very
        traditional lineup of  ~15-20 pieces of nigiri and one handroll. I’d
        describe the vibe as a little intense, but definitely a treat for sushi
        lovers — very fresh, outstanding flavors and textures. There is also a
        Super Omakase option for $310 and other add ons / upgrades like Wagyu
        beef. The tea selection was great and they appeared to have one of the
        larger Japanese whiskey selections I’ve ever seen. Thank you!
