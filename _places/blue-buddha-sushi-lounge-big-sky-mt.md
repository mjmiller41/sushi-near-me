        We had mixed feelings about our visit. Upon arrival on a Wednesday
        night, we were told the wait would be 60 minutes, which we were fine
        with. We grabbed a drink next door at The Drunken Monk (which was
        fantastic) while we waited. However, 60 minutes came and went with no
        update. We noticed other parties who arrived after us being seated, so
        we checked in and were told we were next on the list.


        After 1.5 hours, we asked again, and the hostess responded with
        attitude, claiming we should have received a notice that they couldn’t
        seat us—though we never did. We asked for a manager which never came.
        Shortly after, she returned and said she could seat us but that we
        needed to order quickly.


        Once seated, our server was prompt but brought the wrong sauce for our
        order and forgot our beers. Despite this, the appetizer was excellent,
        and the kitchen staff was clearly working hard—much appreciated! The
        food itself was fantastic, but from arrival to actually eating, it took
        over three hours.


        If you have the time, the food is worth it. However, if you’re looking
        for a quick, efficient dining experience, you might want to consider
        other options.

        fantastic) while we waited. However, 60 minutes came and went with no
        update. We noticed other parties who arrived after us being seated, so
        we checked in and were told we were next on the list.


        After 1.5 hours, we asked again, and the hostess responded with
        attitude, claiming we should have received a notice that they couldn’t
        seat us—though we never did. We asked for a manager which never came.
        Shortly after, she returned and said she could seat us but that we
        needed to order quickly.


        Once seated, our server was prompt but brought the wrong sauce for our
        order and forgot our beers. Despite this, the appetizer was excellent,
        and the kitchen staff was clearly working hard—much appreciated! The
        food itself was fantastic, but from arrival to actually eating, it took
        over three hours.


        If you have the time, the food is worth it. However, if you’re looking
        for a quick, efficient dining experience, you might want to consider
        other options.

        Stopped in for dinner while visiting and everything was fantastic! I
        ordered a huckleberry mule and a strawberry basil sake gimlet (highly
        recommend). We ordered jalepeno poppers, edamame, and shishito peppers
        to split between three people. The jalepeno poppers and the sushi rolls
        were huge!! Our food and drinks came out promptly. We thankfully got
        seated without reservations but it was busy so I’d make reservations if
        we go again just in case.

        Whoever designed this place knew what they were doing. What a vibe.
        Drinks were delicious, food was amazing. We had a party of 15 and our
        service was amazing and interactive.

        From the moment I read the cover of the menu the expectations were set -
        it was going to be slow. It stated as much telling clientele to be
        patient for food and service.


        The food was good. But not worth the wait. I’ve had far better and more
        imaginative sushi.


        The service was lacking. We initially blamed the sushi chefs but the
        service wasn’t much better. Even though I could see the clear
        frustration by our server that night when he was in the kitchen, he
        could have been honest vs telling us ‘our food is up next’ or ‘they are
        cutting the rolls now’. After stating the latter, the wrong rolls showed
        up 20 minutes later. And these rolls were for a table that sat and
        ordered after we had. Then finally the right rolls showed up an
        additional ~5 mins later.


        Would love to say it was just an off night as these will happen - many
        other tables were loudly complaining and I believe one walked out
        without getting their food - but reading the reviews, this seems to be
        more of the norm.


        They did offer a free dessert but that really didn’t salvage the evening
        on our last night in town.

        LOVE blue buddha!!!!! Their food is so good it’s crazy.


        I have a lot of food allergies and the kitchen and our waiter went above
        and beyond to make sure I didn’t eat anything dangerous and even stoped
        us from wasting our money on something that they said, with all the
        modifications I needed, wouldn’t be worth it.


        They double checked on everything for me, cleaned all their utensils and
        counter tops, just, absolutely top notch service. And the food is so
        good!


        Great portion sizes.


        The handrolls are the best I’ve ever had and I eat a lot of sushi.
