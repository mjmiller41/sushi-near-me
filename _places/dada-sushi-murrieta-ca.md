        This was easily the best sushi experience i have had outside of a
        Michelin restaurant in Los Angeles. It is truly remarkable that the
        owner has accomplished what he has in the small, not so bougie town of
        Murrieta. (Very few 5 star retaurants in the area). The fish was
        unbelievably fresh, the service was authentic, and the portion size more
        generous than most. The salmon skin offerings are properly crispy, the
        roe not overly salty, and  the fish was just exquisite. The non fish
        appetizers were also fantastic, the korean chicken... i have to say it
        was one of the top 5 foods i have ever eaten. I can NOT recommend this
        place enough!

        Lunchtime sushi was absolute blissful. Sat at the bar and the sushi chef
        guided us through several bluefin cuts. We got an order of bluefin
        collar and we received one traditional and the other lightly seasoned
        and torched. Killer experience every time.  Highly recommend for anyone
        seeking a true sushi experience

        we had a few days to kill in Murrieta, so we had dinner at Dada Sushi
        which has been open since 2021. This place was popping on a rainy
        Thursday night. They have a slideshow of their owner carving up the tuna
        that they get shipped in, so I had high hopes. We started with the belly
        trio that had chutoro, otoro, yellowtail belly, with sturgeon caviar and
        truffle ponzu, I couldn’t really taste the caviar, but for $29, this was
        a great deal, especially since the fish was ultra buttery. Next up I
        started ordering some hand rolls, the first one was a negi toro, and
        quite honestly has been the best negs toro I’ve ever had. It was
        buttery, packed, and had a slight citrusy zest to it. I also had a
        yellowtail hand roll which was good, additionally, the service here was
        kinda spotty, they forgot quite a few things such as sauces, and hand
        rolls that were ordered but never came. I did order more negi toro hand
        rolls because they were phenomenal and a good deal for the quality. The
        spicy tuna hand roll was decent, but I wouldn’t get it again.

        I was so sad when the old sushi restaurant went out of business and I
        was skeptical of this new one but I decided to give it a try and I was
        not disappointed! The service was great and the food was amazing too! I
        was also very happy to see that the bathrooms are still decorated like
        they were before! I love it! Will definitely be back!
