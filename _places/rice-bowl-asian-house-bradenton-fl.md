        Alright, the fam and I hit up Rice Bowl Asian House today, and man, we
        were blown away! This place is a total gem if you’re craving some killer
        Asian grub. We went straight for their General Tso’s Rice Bowl and the
        Kung Pao Mandarin Style Rice Bowl, and let me tell you, they did not
        disappoint.

        The General Tso’s was everything you’d hope for—crispy, tangy, and just
        the right amount of sweet, with a big ol’ pile of juicy white meat
        chicken tossed in there. They didn’t skimp at all—every bite had that
        perfect sauce-to-chicken ratio. Then there’s the Kung Pao Mandarin Style
        Rice Bowl, which brought the heat in the best way. It’s got this zesty,
        spicy kick with a little citrus vibe going on, and again, loaded with
        tender, tasty chicken. Both bowls were straight-up flavor bombs, and the
        rice soaked it all up like a champ.

        The vibe in there was super chill, and the service? Top-notch. The staff
        were crazy friendly—quick with the food and just made the whole meal
        feel easy and fun. We’re already plotting our next trip back because,
        honestly, we can’t stop raving about it. If you’re into Asian eats and
        haven’t checked this spot out yet, do yourself a favor and go. You’ll
        thank me later!

        Alright, the fam and I hit up Rice Bowl Asian House today, and man, we
        were blown away! This place is a total gem if you’re craving some killer
        Asian grub. We went straight for their General Tso’s Rice Bowl and the
        Kung Pao Mandarin Style Rice Bowl, and let me tell you, they did not
        disappoint.

        The octopus kebab was tasty, but definitely overcooked (very very
        rubbery). I also had fried calamari (tasted great). The entree ordered
        was braised beef with rice. The taste was good (not wow), but pretty
        good. Service was excellent (very attentive).

        EDIT: I called the restaurant back as requested in their response and I
        was not offered a refund, but a $20 gift card. I was told that this is a
        family business and I should take my review down. I was also told that
        maybe I didn't like the food because of my mood when I was eating the
        food and my personal feelings that day. I was also told that I upset the
        owner because of my review and that they don't want ME to hurt their
        business. I wanted a refund, not a gift card to a restaurant I'm not
        willing to eat at again. Unprofessional response.


        ORIGINAL POST:

        The food was mostly awful. Overcooked slop like fried rice, Bourbon
        Chicken was very dry chicken squares floating in a full bowl sauce, and
        I mean to the rim, seeping into the rice, making it like a thick soup
        like consistency. I ended up draining it and giving it go the dog.


        Steamed Pot Stickers were good, dipping sauce also good.


        Egg rolls outside was crunchy, but raw dough on the inside and the
        filling had some kind of meat or chicken or liver ground like sand,
        tasted like organs. No one wanted them.


        The General Tso was ok, steamed white rice ok. The Crab Rangoon was
        HORRIBLE. it had thick yellow slimy sauce dumped over the fried Rangoon,
        absolutely gross. Why would they do that, I don't know but it was
        disgusting and unexpected.


        Kids Chicken Lo Mein was abismal at best, tasteless and overcooked
        noodles. We won't be ordering anymore. $60 of garbage food. Waste of
        money. When will Bradenton ever get a good Chinese Food place?

        We order takeout all the time from here....and I was surprised I've
        never rated them. There food is always hot when it arrives and full of
        flavor. It is our go to for delivery. The eggrolls aren't greasy and so
        packed. The bourbon chicken bowl is our favorite.....so delicious. And
        of course....hubby is addicted to dumplings so he never places an order
        without them. Prices are reasonable and food never disappoints.


        8/25/22 Flew in during the evening  and not in the mood to cook when I
        wS home so we ordered some dinner from rice bowl. The sesame style
        chicken hit the spot. Arrived hot and full of flavor. My husband enjoyed
        his chicken bowl as well.

        Friendly staff. The decor is rather plain. The fried rice was pretty
        good but as other reviewers mention there is no seasoning. The lack of
        seasoning was true to every dish. The vegetables, aside from the corn
        which I think is canned, were fresh! With just a little bit of salt on
        their food the dishes would be fantastic!


        Usually I would give a restaurant like this 3 stars. I gave them 4 stars
        because the fried rice was really great - not oily or heavy (although it
        needed salt) and they use fresh veg (which should be commonplace in a
        restaurant but sadly isn't).
