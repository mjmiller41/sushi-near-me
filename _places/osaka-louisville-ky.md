        My Son and his Fiance' was craving some Sushi and this is a place he has
        never tried so we gave it a whirl. This is located on Frankfort Ave in a
        really people friendly part of town. We ordered the Shrimp and Vegetable
        Tempura as an appetizer and each ordered a roll. I ordered the Specialty
        called the "Osaka Roll"! The other two rolls were pretty typical Derby
        Roll and Earthquake roll.

        The presentation of the Osaka Roll was fantastic and came out to the
        table where the server lit the plate and it cooked the cheese that was
        on this roll with the flames. It's pictured above with a flame along
        with the other two rolls. The whole flame presentation was very cool and
        the flavor combination was also very good.

        Service was pretty straightforward nothing over the top (average
        experience) and the ambience of the restaurant was relaxed and
        comfortable.  As it stands I would like to give this place a try again
        and try the Hibachi but I would definitely recommend the restaurant if
        you are up for a new place to check out.

        It has been a while since I’ve had decent Japanese food. Unlike some
        have said, they do honor Groupon other than on Valentine’s Day or for
        alcohol orders. I enjoyed the seafood udon, and the (flaming) Osaka roll
        that tastes like freshness. Tip: park on Bellaire & Frankfort and it’s a
        quick walk to the restaurant.

        To see 4.5 stars on a sushi restaurant is frustrating. This place is a 3
        star restaurant at best charging for top tier sushi. If your an into
        rolls I’d still say go somewhere else for quality. That must be what’s
        bringing the reviews though. The spicy tuna roll was almost sorry
        drenched in another sauce that might have actually ruined okay spicy
        tuna. The nigiri is served lukewarm and the sushi rice the cut is over
        is horrid. You can’t forget to leave out the globs of wasabi that
        accompanied the rice. I can’t say I’m a professional by any means but
        I’d like to think the Japanese would frown on the construction of these
        rolls. Please read my view understanding I can appreciate good food that
        is not my style. This is not worth what they’re offering and they know
        that. Hence to why they have no website with a menu to check out. $26.95
        for Sushi A that had 7 pieces of Nigiri as well as a California roll
        included (I upgraded the California to the spicy tuna). That is fairly
        standard with a nice place that includes soup and salad or atleast one
        or the other.  This place is making a fortune of there poor practice of
        making sushi and I do not recommend you visiting. Sapporo provides a
        much more fulfilling experience at a much better value. I’ve tried the
        vast majority of the sushi restaurants around town. Unfortunately this
        one was another let down. I’m hopeful for the upcoming places here as
        it’s really a small market of sushi worth eating, in and outside of
        Louisville!

        Sushi list that I have seen in Louisville.
