        If you are walking around the mall and want a more classy experience
        than the normal food court then walk down to Sushi 🍣 Yummy!! You can
        sit at the bar and pick your choice of creative assorted sushi as the 
        plates go around the bar on a conveyer belt!! Sushi Yummy gives you an
        assortment of dim sum sized bbq pork bao bun to dumplings to spring
        rolls, seaweed salad and the traditional nigiri pieces. Dont forget the
        chocolate cake, cheesecake, lemon cake slice and more. I ordered miso
        soup 🍲  with my meal and they have the ever so favorite Japanese Ramune
        carbonated drinks. So come get your Asian fix right here at Sushi Yummy
        in the Florida Mall right by Pink Victoria's Secret!!!

        rolls, seaweed salad and the traditional nigiri pieces. Dont forget the
        chocolate cake, cheesecake, lemon cake slice and more. I ordered miso
        soup 🍲  with my meal and they have the ever so favorite Japanese Ramune
        carbonated drinks. So come get your Asian fix right here at Sushi Yummy
        in the Florida Mall right by Pink Victoria's Secret!!!

        If they actually tried to replicate how they do it in Japan, they would
        have a thriving business. As someone who's lived in Japan and seen the
        real belt sushi places.  This place is a great Disappointment ❌. It
        misses the point of the belt sushi places.  The point is to go and stack
        as many plates for cheap. Quantity over price.


        This place is wayyyy too expensive 💵💵💵

        The concept in Japan is to have a cheap place for sushi that you just
        sit and grab plates at random.  Normally $1 or less per plate and maybe
        $3 for the premium option.


        It's missing the sauce tray with different sauce options.


        3.50 for 2 wheels of Publix tasting sushi...  They're crazy.  No wonder
        is mostly empty at peak lunch hour.  (See picture below).

        We dined here for my friends birthday today and we’re extremely
        disappointed. our meal was $90 and we left hungry and unhappy. We only
        saw our server 3 times. The third time of seeing the server we had to go
        find him. Our server seemed unmotivated and showed no interest in our
        dining experience. The sushi tasted low quality and not fresh at all.
        The conveyer is what brought us here but most of the items remained
        empty the entire hour we were there. I truly hope today was just an off
        day for them and others are able to have a better experience than what i
        saw today.

        I am utterly disappointed in this restaurant. PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE! I
        would just like to tell everyone that it WILL NOT be worth your TIME or
        MONEY. I am a very patient person and am always kind to the hard working
        waitresses…but this was just something else. I ate here today with my
        family, January 9th, and got the passive aggressive girl waitress. She
        didn’t have much to say and didn’t have the faint of a smile. She hasn’t
        come back in a while to take our orders, so the chef had to do it
        instead. Once we ordered, we waited a good 20-25 minutes just for 2 Poke
        Bowls. 1st off, PRICE ARE RIDICULOUS!! Especially for the quality! The
        sushi is totally mediocre and the poke bowls are 95% lettuce!!!
        Furthermore, they got BOTH POKE BOWL ORDERS WRONG!!! The passive
        aggressive waitress did not handle the situation with any kindness or
        compassion for her customers, she just threw it out instead of giving
        more options other than to keep it. This was a surprise to all of us.
        After our mediocre meal, the passive aggressive waitress told the chef
        some other story about what happened to the bowl and then talked to us
        about it!! Like what?!? We explained what actually happened and he said
        he got 2 different sides of the story. Personally, I do not like that us
        as customers had to defend ourselves against their own coworkers. While
        the chef talked to us, they were staring at us, leaning on the walls
        behind him. It was the janitor girl and the passive aggressive girl.
        Interesting why they felt the need to witnesses the situation she caused
        to unfold. Honestly, the chef was really nice, especially given that he
        didn’t really know what happened in the first place, therefore I don’t
        see why the waitress wanted to get him involved. All in all, this was
        too expensive and a very stressful and ultimately a time consuming
        situation for mediocre food and a passive AGGRESSIVE waitress. I hope
        the mandatory 18% that AUTOMATICALLY gets added to your check!! goes to
        the cooks for being the nicest ones there and having to work with some
        passive AGGRESSIVE waitress. That image of the little sushi I attached,
        yeah THAT WAS $4.50 for that little piece. Oh! And the little green cup?
        Yup, that is supposedly a seaweed salad for $4. Maybe for a bird. Be for
        real.

        I was staying at the Florida Hotel for work and planned on grabbing
        something from the food court for dinner, but I decided to try this
        instead and I’m so glad I did!!! It was some of the best sushi I’ve ever
        had, and I love that the small portions allow you to try several
        different types of rolls. I ate way more sushi than I normally do
        because everything was just sooo YUMMY!!!
