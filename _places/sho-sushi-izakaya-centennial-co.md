        We went there for the 1st time after reading many positive reviews of
        the place and we decided to do ACE premium.

        We are guided to the table with a broken bulk so the light was not great
        to take photos.

        We ordered various dishes but only sashimi was good (which is limited
        order unfortunately), and the remaining were only average.

        First is the oysters. They are very small & skinny. It is $12 a piece
        and you are limited to one piece only for ACE. Who pays $12 for that
        oyster piece would be very disappointed for sure. (We paid ACE and still
        unpleasant).

        Then the BBQ beef and bulgogi and beef skewers are very chewy. We could
        not make it. We all had to spit out because we couldn’t swallow that
        chewy beefs.

        For special sashimi, we were limited to order and each order has 4 very
        thin pieces of sashimi. They charge $14/$15 each order if you don’t do
        ACE so again, kind of pricey.

        Other rolls and dishes are nothing special.

        For the price of ACE $42.99 we will not come back again for that quality
        of food there.

        Was pleasantly surprised on New Year's Eve by the selection and quality
        of the AYCE menu and the ambience of Sho Sushi & Izakaya , right by
        Arapahoe and Parker in Centennial. They have three levels of AYCE menu,
        regular, blue and orange. I highly recommend choosing the orange AYCE as
        it includes 3 types of traditional sashimi, 9 types of specialty
        sashimi, 4 types of specialty nigiri as well as sashimi salad, fresh
        oyster, lobster dynamite, and refreshing zaru udon. Ordering three or
        four of these a la carte probably already cost more than the $42.99 AYCE
        price, not taking into account of many other tasty appetizers, nigiri,
        rolls and Korean entrees on the blue and regular menu. The service was
        also prompt and attentive. Certainly one of the best AYCE sushi
        restaurants in town.

        Randomly stopped here, and I'm glad I did.  I am not a big fish guy, but
        there is some sushi that's really good.  Our waitress was amazing in
        helping me and had great recommendations.  The food tasted great!  I
        would highly coming here.  I will for sure come back with my family. 
        Such great choices too, between hot food and sushi.  So anyone can eat
        here.  The environment was really nice and clean too.

        As self-proclaimed AYCE connoisseurs, my wife and I tried them all—and
        Sho Sushi blows every other restaurant out of the water! The fish is
        always fresh, the flavors are on point, and the staff is warm and
        welcoming. If you’re lucky enough to get Ann as your server, prepare for
        next-level hospitality—she goes above and beyond to make every visit
        unforgettable.

        We love it so much that what started as a casual try has turned into a
        weekly tradition. Sho Sushi is an experience worth craving. 10/10
        recommend!

        I had an excellent experience at Sho! The service is top-notch and the
        staff, specifically our server Lucas was friendly and was able to help
        us a lot throughout our dining experience. The sushi was fresh and was
        of very high quality. Plus their rolls were realy delicious. The food,
        service, and atmosphere were really enjoyable and it was a nice place to
        eat. If you’re in the area and craving sushi, this place is definitely
        worth checking out.
