        Just happened to stop in while walking, and looking for somewhere to eat
        near market square, and we’re VERY happy with our choice. The rolls were
        HUGE and delicious! The miso had amazing flavor! The staff were friendly
        and quick. It’s very small inside, but definitely worth checking out.

        I’m not sure how this place is so highly rated.   The sushi is
        terrible.   It is way too much rice, falls apart when trying to eat it
        and it doesn’t taste fresh.   The rice was also very very dry.  I threw
        most of my meal away it was that bad .  I should’ve listened to the
        reviews about the rolls falling apart.  They even put rice INSIDE the
        rolls to make them look bigger.  Look at my photo.


        They also messed up my order and didn’t send two pieces of nigiri and
        argued with me on the phone about it until they realized I was
        correct.   They said they would refund but didn’t.   The way they show
        on the order is confusing as it says 1X but then a second row for an add
        on.


        Overall, head somewhere else.   These positive reviews must be paid for
        or friends or something.

        I LOVE this place. My favorite place to get sushi in town. The Yummy
        Yummy roll is my go to with a side of seaweed salad. The staff is great
        and friendly. The food is always fresh, every roll is made to order and
        the sides are so good. I tried the baby octopus salad. It was flavorful
        but for my first time I liked the flavor and not the texture. They
        always have combo specials. There’s hightop tables for dinning so take
        out is more popular.

        It’s a cute little shop, they move quick so you can be in and out or you
        can dine in. The prices are really good to be located in a downtown
        area. — I’m visiting for work.


        You’ll see on the pic of the container what I ordered. I really wanted
        to enjoy it, but I feel like because they are so quick they didn’t
        handle my food with care. The sushi was falling apart as I was picking
        it up. It was like the rice was not sticking together and the seaweed
        was like easily punctured so when I picked it up it would smash and
        break apart.


        The yummy yum was okay, but I’m not a fan of imitation crab meat. Which
        ironically, the lam back had real crab meat and it was fishy. So crazy
        right.


        See pics. I feel like I’d go back, because of the price but I’d need
        them to fix my issue. I saw someone else’s look better than mine, so idk
        if it’s based on the type of roll or not.
