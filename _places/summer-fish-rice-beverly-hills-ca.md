        Amazing sushi!!!! The ingredients are fresh and I can taste how much
        effort they put in their dish. Comparing to all the overpriced sushi
        nearby, this place earned its price. The staff member are super friendly
        too. I would love to come here every day if I could.


        My favorite dishes are the summer sushi, the salmon skin salad, the
        mushroom/chicken karaage, she’s from Miami roll, and my favorite dessert
        of all time, the green tea tempura. They taste so amazing and this place
        definitely deserves a visit!

        A lovely sushi spot, and our new favorite spot for sushi in LA. The
        sushi was so fresh and flavorful, salmon was buttery and delicious,
        every dish was perfectly seasoned and balanced. We loved every single
        thing we ordered. The best crispy rice I’ve ever had, we ordered more at
        the end of our meal because it was so tasty. Also the place itself is a
        serene and minimalist space, with a warm, inviting ambiance that
        balances simplicity with elegance.


        My party ordered chicken karaage, shishito peppers, crispy rice, plenty
        of fish roll, tuna mango avocado roll, 911 roll, Thursday night roll,
        and Philly roll, and the lemon salmon sashimi, and every single dish was
        amazing. I also have a shellfish allergy and they were great at
        accommodating that, can tell they take cleanliness and allergies
        seriously.

        Located in the heart of Beverly Hills, Summer Fish & Rice is a hidden
        gem that brings a slice of Japan to Los Angeles. With its fresh,
        high-quality seafood, a welcoming ambiance, and an excellent selection
        of beers and sake, this restaurant stands out as a must-visit for sushi
        enthusiasts and anyone looking for an authentic Japanese dining
        experience.


        Sashimi and Nigiri

        The quality of the sashimi and nigiri at Summer Fish & Rice is truly
        remarkable. Each piece is meticulously prepared, highlighting the
        freshness and natural flavors of the fish. The Bluefin tuna was buttery
        and rich, practically melting in your mouth, while the Yellowtail
        offered a delicate, slightly sweet taste that was perfectly balanced.
        The squid had a clean, subtle flavor with a nice bite, and the Halibut
        was soft with a refined texture. The Japanese mackerel, known for its
        rich and oily profile, was a standout with its depth of flavor, leaving
        a lasting impression. The care and attention to detail in every slice
        speak volumes about the quality and passion of the chefs here.


        Rolls: Crab, Eel, Maki, and Shishito Peppers

        Equally impressive were the rolls, particularly the crab, eel,
        traditional maki, and the delightful addition of shishito peppers. Each
        roll was thoughtfully crafted, combining fresh ingredients with
        perfectly seasoned rice. The crab roll was a wonderful blend of sweet,
        delicate crab meat and crisp vegetables, while the eel roll brought a
        delightful smokiness and a touch of sweetness that was simply
        irresistible. The maki rolls were equally well-executed, showcasing a
        harmonious balance of textures and flavors that is often hard to find.
        The shishito peppers added a unique, slightly smoky flavor with a hint
        of heat that provided a nice contrast to the cool, fresh seafood, making
        for a memorable bite. These rolls are perfect for those looking to
        explore different tastes and combinations without compromising on
        quality.


        Beverage Selection

        One of the highlights of Summer Fish & Rice is its impressive beer and
        sake menu. With a variety of options to choose from, there is something
        for every palate, whether you’re a sake connoisseur or simply looking to
        complement your meal with a crisp, refreshing beer. The staff is
        knowledgeable and happy to provide recommendations, ensuring that each
        pairing enhances the flavors of the dishes. It’s an excellent way to
        elevate the dining experience and enjoy a true taste of Japanese
        culture.


        Atmosphere and Service

        The atmosphere at Summer Fish & Rice is bright, lively, and reminiscent
        of a classic sushi bar in Japan (remember me a bar in Tokyo). There is a
        warm and inviting energy throughout the restaurant, making it a great
        spot for both regular patrons and first-time visitors. I highly
        recommend sitting at the sushi bar, where you can engage with the chef,
        watch them expertly prepare each dish, and gain a deeper appreciation
        for the art of sushi-making. The service is attentive and friendly,
        enhancing the overall experience with a genuine sense of hospitality.
        Having visited several times, I can say that the consistency in both
        food and service is truly commendable.


        Summer Fish & Rice captures the essence of a Japan sushi bar experience
        right in Beverly Hills. From the top-notch sashimi and nigiri to the
        thoughtfully crafted rolls, including the unique touch of shishito
        peppers, and excellent beverage options, this restaurant delivers on all
        fronts. Whether you’re a local or a visitor, this is a spot that
        deserves a place on your list. With a vibrant atmosphere, great food,
        and the opportunity to engage with skilled chefs at the sushi bar,
