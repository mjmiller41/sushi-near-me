        Really happy with the service and food. The atmosphere is very relaxing.
        Finding parking was no problem. This is one of three favorite places in
        Providence for a sushi night out.

        Very underwhelming experience. I came here because of recommendations on
        Reddit for a good sushi spot in Providence. Some comments were saying
        sushi in Providence is trash, and to head to Cranston. They might have
        been right I fear.


        We were seated quickly. The inside has a nice comforting feel.


        It took a while for the server to come to us, but that gave us plenty of
        time to decide. We ordered the steamed shrimp shumai, sushi regular, and
        chicken yakisoba. The shumai were a healthy size and were very good.
        Definitely my favorite part of the meal. The sushi was very basic,
        honestly I’ve had better sushi at market basket. The yakisoba was fine,
        but nothing spectacular. We did enjoy the miso soup and salad that came
        with them, but I have had better for less $.


        In addition I felt service was quite slow in getting us our check.
        Overall save your money. There are definitely better spots not too far
        away.

        Food was ok, taste was underwhelming, but our server was nice. There
        were 5 of us and food came out at a good pace. Never got my sushi I
        ordered so the server had to take it off my bill at the end. It was kind
        of empty for a Friday night at 7, we were sat right in the hallway which
        meant a lot of back and forth walking from people behind us (servers
        mostly). Drinks were good, sumobowl was well poured! Price was ~$300
        with tip for the 5 of us. We got 4 apps, 5 entrees and 3 cocktails with
        1 sumobowl (2+ people to be served).

        We moved to PVD in June from NH and this has been our go-to spot for
        high quality sushi and super good rolls.
