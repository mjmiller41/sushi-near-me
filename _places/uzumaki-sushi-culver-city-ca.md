        The food is AMAZING and the staff is extremely nice and helpful! Service
        comes quick and the food never disappoints. The sushi is well priced
        too—it’s not too expensive! I got 3 rolls for under $40.

        Fantastic sushi spot with good value. The Uzumaki sets are great -
        salmon and hamachi were standouts. The toro roll and unagi were worth it
        as well.


        Hidden gem would be the fish kaarage - the fish was so soft and
        flavorful, highly recommend over the chicken one


        Service is super quick and on point - they're always busing dishes and
        food came out quickly. Great for when you want something a little nicer
        but don't want the full Omakase

        I’ve been coming to Uzumaki for years and liked it much better when they
        had a sushi bar. The servers that work there don’t really know what
        they’re doing. They kept snatching plates from right under my face the
        second I finished the last piece. It was anxiety-inducing. They would
        also refill water and green tea and sake without asking even when just a
        tiny bit was gone from the glass. We spent almost $400 including tip and
        I would have really appreciated a better dining experience. When I
        picked up the last piece of my chef’s omakase, the waitress swooped in,
        grabbed my plate and immediately started asking us what we wanted for
        dessert. I couldn’t even answer her because I was still chewing. I
        honestly wish someone would train these servers properly because for
        these prices, that is simply unacceptable!!


        The food was good. We loved the oysters especially and even ordered a
        second round. The salmon was clearly farmed though and not wild-caught
        (you could tell by the color and thick white stripes). Would have
        expected better quality for the price. Probably won’t come back anytime
        soon! For the price, you can find better places.

        Great place, Amazing food. The ambiance is good not great. This place
        could be a fine dining experience but it is more of every day great
        sushi place m. One the best dish quality I have had in Los Angeles. The
        food is very simple but it’s extremely delicious. This a very difficult
        task to achieve. No unnecessary flavoring trying hard to make the food
        taste better. The service was very good , very fast. I love ginger and I
        hate that I have to continually ask for more. They kept my ginger plate
        full the whole time. I only wish they would take reservations as hate
        waiting for my table. I will be returning with my wife and friends for
        more. The albacore and yellowtail were to die for, Amazing.

        Only had sushi, overpriced with small portions.

        Servers cleared too often, sometimes before we finished entire meal.

        Waitress explained our sushi, even when we already knew how to put
        wadsbi and soy sauce together..

        Not sure they were even Japanese..I believe they were Chinese or Korean.
