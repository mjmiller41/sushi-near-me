        10/10 go here immediately if you are in the tampa area! Absolutely
        everything we ordered was delicious.


        We started with the Sake Pulled Pork Bao Buns and the Prawn Carpaccio.
        Both had very unique flavor profiles and were quite the journey. We had
        4 sushi rolls and each one was great but the Kani was hands down my
        favorite with the Tempora Poke a close second. The others we got were
        Kanpachi and an off menu salmon roll.

        Classy space, great service, delicious food. Every dish was nicely done
        from the toro rolls and nigiri, to the buns and ramen, the appetizers
        were great, the steak was fab, and the dessert was the perfect ending. 
        The one caveat I would say is that I think everything was really good
        but thought the prices were a little high for what you got. I personally
        would be happy to come back again and again but some in our party
        thought it was too expensive for what was delivered.  I thought maybe a
        little high but good enough that I would come back.

        Exceptional, friendly staff that worked very well together to make our
        dining experience special.  The ambiance was sophisticated and
        comfortable.  The food,especially the sushi was fresh, tasty, and
        creatively plated. The drinks were an interesting take on some classics.

        This place is really a great place. First off, the ambience of the place
        is really good and the atmosphere is really nice.

        The next u see is that the service is the best. We had Ronnie serve our
        table and she did such an amazing job right from the start to the end.

        And now to talk about the food it was just phenomenal. The taste of the
        food is so rich and the flavors are so well balanced it's just really
        amazing. Plus u can taste the freshness of the ingredients.

        Me and my friends tried the beef tartare , kamo crostini , tan tan men
        ramen, black ramen and bone marrow

        Everything we tried was really delicious.

        And we were recommended to try the beef tartare and kamo crostini and it
        was just so heavenly. Love the place and food.

        And i would also like to thank Ronnie, because one of my friends
        accidentally forgot their car keys in the restaurant and she ran behind
        us to give us the keys ð

        My boyfriend took me out for my birthday and 10/10 everything. From the
        ambiance to the food and Japanese inspired decor...was just WOW.  We sat
        in the booths and they are really comfortable, very intimate and felt
        like we werenât congested. My boyfriend is 6â1 and didnât feel like he
        was in a tight spot and had plenty of leg room. Place is seriously clean
        and not overall dark where you canât see people or your food.  Our
        waitress was so sweet, attentive and very knowledgeable of the menu. She
        gave us the whole 411, and didnât rush us when we were browsing and
        still deciding. They had a lot to serve! Not just her, other staff would
        come to our booth to clear out the table and let me tell you that our
        water cups were always full and always checking in but not the annoying
        way. Next time when we have more time, DEFINITELY want to try out the
        24oz American Wagyu Ribeye along with the ramen and go back to our
        favorites and try others.  Everything was so fresh and cooked to
        perfection. We are definitely sushi-enthusiasts and you got a 5+ star
        from us. Thank you Noble Rice for the first best experience. Such a
        hidden gem!  I went home and was in a food- coma. And I just woke up to
        write this review lol. Iâll definitely be back with friends and family!
