        A small, unassuming sushi restaurant with really good food. I highly
        recommend this hidden gem. Service is always great, and their fish is
        fresh and delicious! No conveyor belt - everything is made to order and
        you can taste the difference.

        Great hole in the wall sushi restaurant well worth the visit.  Fairly
        small and tends to be busy during peak times but wait time isn't bad and
        they have kind and attentive staff, excellent quality food, overall
        highly recommended.  Authentic beef teriyaki, sushi, and all other
        dishes I have tried are winners, can't go wrong.

        We decided to check this place out given the high reviews. We love sushi
        and usually try different locations. We went at a late afternoon time so
        it wasn't busy. We were welcomed and promptly seated. The service was
        kind and attentive. The atmosphere was chill. We ordered two jasmine hot
        teas, edamame, a veggie roll, spicy tuna roll, spider roll, and the
        Samurai roll. While they do have a large selection of rolls, there's
        nothing really unique or interesting about them. The tea was just a bag
        from the Stash brand. We prefer loose leaf or higher quality teas
        typically served at other places. The edamame was perfectly steamed and
        salted. The sushi was very disappointing. The spicy tuna had really no
        flavor or spice and I usually don't handle much heat. My partner said
        the spider tasted off and was worried the crab was spoiled. The veggie
        and Samurai rolls were just okay. Not a fan of Kikkoman soy sauce but
        that's just me so take it with a grain of salt. I can't justify the
        quality for the price. I will absolutely pay $15-20 per roll for quality
        sushi but this isn't it. Total was about $55 (before tip).

        Been two times. One dine in and one to-go order. Staff is very nice.
        Sushi fresh and delicious. I had the Wildcat Roll as I do not eat raw
        fish. Teriyaki chicken is grilled to order. Not dry. Could used a little
        more teriyaki sauce or a side of teriyaki sauce with each order. LOVE
        the stir fried veggies that come with teriyaki dishes.

        Walked in on a Thursday night about 45 minutes to close and Sushi Ave
        did not disappoint! The restaurant was clean and the staff were all
        super friendly. The potstickers are crispy (I highly recommend!). We
        ordered multiple options to try it all and we were so happy we did
        because everything was amazing!
