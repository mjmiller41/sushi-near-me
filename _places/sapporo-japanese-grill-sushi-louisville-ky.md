        Last time I was here has been 23 years ago. Life happened and I ended up
        moving down to Florida. Drove 11 hours from Florida to come back here.
        It's WAY better than 23 years ago. Food is phenomenal! The ambience and
        atmosphere is something you have to experience for yourself. If you have
        not been here before, why are you looking at other places? Get yourself
        over here now! No excuses! Hurry up!

        The food here is awesome! We stopped by for dinner on a Saturday night
        and got right in. We tried the peach sake, the tilapia hibachi, as well
        as the Golden Cadillac & the Jp special sushi rolls. Every bite was
        awesome. The hibachi took a few extra minutes to come out but it wasn’t
        a huge problem. Our server was very quick and friendly, with great
        recommendations.. thanks Jacqueline!

        Sapporo is hands down the best Japanese restaurant in Louisville. From
        the moment you walk in, the atmosphere sets the tone for an exceptional
        dining experience. The restaurant is spacious with plenty of seating,
        great lighting, and TVs, creating a comfortable and inviting vibe. What
        stands out most, though, is the service. I have never once had a bad
        experience here. The staff is attentive and friendly, making sure every
        visit is as enjoyable as the last.


        As for the food, it’s simply outstanding. Every dish I’ve tried here has
        been consistently top-tier, from sushi to ramen and everything in
        between. My family and I eat at Sapporo at least twice a month, and it’s
        a favorite for good reason. Each item is cooked to order and fresh,
        making the quality of the food well worth the price. Given its
        popularity, there can be a bit of a wait on busy nights, but it’s always
        worth it for food this good.


        Sapporo also uses a QR code menu, which is convenient and keeps
        everything touch-free, especially helpful in today’s environment. Even
        the bathrooms are spotless, showing the staff’s attention to detail.
        Other than its location in a busy area with a bit of traffic, I
        genuinely can’t find a complaint. If you love Japanese food and
        excellent service, Sapporo won’t disappoint.

        Very nice restaurant overall, the fish hibachi was a bit dry and
        flavorless though, and the vegetables were much the same. The steak
        hibachi was excellent though, and the rice for both was fantastic. The
        edamame sat in a pool of oil and butter which was a bit unappetizing but
        it still tasted good. Service was very quick but it felt like the second
        we finished eating we were being rushed out the door. A bit pricy for
        the quality, but still tasty.
