        I dined here for the Valentine’s Day omakase with my girlfriend. This
        fell well below expectations. Having been to numerous omakase
        establishments, we can both confidently say that both the service and
        food quality do not justify the $200+ per person price tag.


        - Lack of Attention to Detail: In intimate omakase settings with fewer
        than ten seats, it is customary for the staff to pull out chairs for
        guests—a small but thoughtful gesture that enhances the overall
        experience. This was noticeably absent here.


        - Premature Upselling: Just three courses into the meal, our waitress
        asked if we would like to order additional nigiri. At a high-end
        omakase, this is highly unusual, if not inappropriate, as the experience
        should be about enjoying the curated menu, not being pressured into
        add-ons before the meal is even complete. My girlfriend, who has dined
        at over 20 omakase restaurants ranging from $150 to $500 per person, has
        never encountered this practice. It came across as a blatant attempt to
        nickel-and-dime guests.


        - Inconsistent Service: While I was served dessert, my girlfriend was
        not. I was then served the check BEFORE my gilrfriend got her dessert.
        This level of oversight is unacceptable at this price point!


        - Use of lower-Quality ingredients: A well-curated omakase experience
        highlights premium cuts of fish. However, this restaurant included sake
        nigiri (salmon) as part of the set menu—something commonly found in
        sushi restaurants at a fraction of the price. High-end omakase
        establishments typically focus on more exclusive selections.


        - Budget choices for white fish: Most reputable omakase venues serve red
        or golden snapper, but this restaurant opted for black snapper, the
        least premium of the three. This further reinforced the impression that
        ingredient costs were being cut.


        - Lack of Engagement from the Chef: Part of the omakase experience is
        the interaction with the chef, who provides insight into each course and
        enhances the meal with their presence. Here, the chef was notably
        disengaged and did not converse with guests, creating a cold and
        uninviting atmosphere. The sushi counter also had a divider which was
        blocking the "view" of sushi making, very odd considering most omakase
        places don't have this.


        Final Thoughts: This restaurant charges a premium price but does not
        deliver a premium experience. Between the lower-quality ingredients, the
        aggressive upselling, and the lack of attention to detail in service, it
        simply does not compare to other omakase establishments in the same
        price range. If you’re looking for an authentic, high-end omakase
        experience, I would recommend looking elsewhere!!

        I wish I had read more bad reviews on this place, so I did not choose
        this restaurant. I am a foodie I've tried restaurants worldwide,
        high-end and low-end, the spectrum. Particularly Japanese restaurants,
        so I have a lot of comparisons making my review. Walking into the place
        itself felt very cold and empty, the lights were way too bright, and it
        hurt both my and my company's eyes.

        The service of the chef was so slow, and it was only five people in the
        restaurant, including ourselves. When it is slow, it messes up the
        temperature of the fish; it was warm and a bit off-putting. The waitress
        was fine in her service.

        The bill came, and regardless of the money being overpriced, it was not
        worth going already. We were all super upset.

        I cannot express how amazing this meal was. Shin is an amazing chef. His
        humble, funny, and kind chat made our dinner. Not a single piece of
        sushi wasn’t perfect. Many changed how I thought of sushi. Highlights
        were the black snapper (cured with kelp), ebi, bluefin, and sea breem.
        Japanese mackerel was perfect. It’s wonderfully chill and homey inside.
        Well worth twice the price. Couldn’t imagine another trip to LA without
        visiting. Would give 6 stars if possible.

        The experience wasn’t terrible but I wouldn’t go back. When I pay a
        certain amount for an omakase, I expect exceptional experience but my
        experience was meh to mediocre. The sushi was small with thin slices,
        minced cucumber placed on top of the fish didn’t pair well with some and
        most importantly, some fish didn’t taste fresh. Now that I’m thinking
        back on the details of my experience, I’m more disappointed. Oh, they
        charge you for hot tap water.

        Excellent value and quality. It's a hidden gem on Westwood and requires
        reservations. They serve the entire room at once and are very strict on
        punctuality. It's so worth it though.
