        This was my second visit, and I noticed some changes in the ambiance
        since my last trip in 2018. The Japanese floor tables (chabudai) have
        been replaced by traditional tables.


        The staff was friendly, and our group of five received our orders in
        just 5-10 minutes. I tried the Chicken Teriyaki and KC Strip steak combo
        lunch plate, which came with clear soup and salad first, followed by the
        combo.


        The plate was a perfect balance of greens, rice, and protein, and I
        loved it. My friends enjoyed their sushi and rolls as well. We visited
        quite late for lunch, so the place wasn’t busy at all.

        This was my second visit, and I noticed some changes in the ambiance
        since my last trip in 2018. The Japanese floor tables (chabudai) have
        been replaced by traditional tables.


        The staff was friendly, and our group of five received our orders in
        just 5-10 minutes. I tried the Chicken Teriyaki and KC Strip steak combo
        lunch plate, which came with clear soup and salad first, followed by the
        combo.

        The food and service at the restaurant was exceptional. Our waitress was
        incredibly friendly and efficient, and the food arrived fast and was
        delicious. The presentation was visually appealing and looked fantastic.
        The restaurant was elegantly furnished and was not very loud. Overall,
        it’s easily one of the best sushi places in the area.

        We had a great experience from start to finish. The interior of the
        restaurant was warm and inviting. The staff was friendly, helpful and
        attentive. The robust menu had something for everyone. We enjoyed a
        variety of sushi rolls which were all fresh, creative and delicious.

        This small hole in the wall probably has some of the best sushi on state
        line. The service was outstanding as we were greeted and seated almost
        immediately with a big friendly smile. The restaurant itself was very
        clean and orderly. I got some salmon Nigiri, miso soup and sea food
        tempura combination. My partner got the rainbow roll and a variety roll.
        The fish tasted fresh, the tempura was extra crispy and our edamame was
        seasoned to perfection. It was very nice to have multiple other options
        incase you want something other than sushi. Overall this experience is
        well worth the price you get!

        4/26/2023 was my first visit to Sushi Haru. My first thoughts when
        walking in were, wow this place looks nice, clean, and well decorated.
        The place was larger than I thought with table choices for 2, 4, 6, or
        extra large booths that might seat 8 people.

        The crab Rangoon appetizer was perfect and the 6 crab Rangoon were at
        least 60% larger than I am used to seeing. Our Sushi rolls arrived about
        the same time we finished the appetizer. The rolls were excellent. I was
        surprised that they were warm and lightly fried with a delicate crisp
        crust on the out side. The texture and flavor were both perfect. I will
        be back for more very soon. I want to try all of the many roll options
        that they offer. In my opinion, the prices were very reasonable and a
        little cheaper than another place where I had Sushi a few days before I
        dined here.

        Check out their menu. They have a lot of dishes, huge Sushi roll
        selection, and group options.
