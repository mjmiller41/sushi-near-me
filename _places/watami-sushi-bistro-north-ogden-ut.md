        Barely even made 2 stars and the only reason they did was because the
        area was clean.


        Waitress was super pissed that I was there or something but she was very
        short and full of enough attitude to keep the place heated.


        As for the sushi they ah e a big banner in the from that says 50% off
        but in all actuality the Dubai is just priced regularly with the
        “discounted price” being an absurdly high price on the menu.


        The sushi quality is about as low as you possibly could get as well
        super massive sizes with way too much rice or inconsistency where it was
        falling apart. The ingredients were such a low quality that I just
        stopped eating halfway through.


        In all there are PLENTY of other places to eat with way better quality.

        Went around 330pm and there was nobody else there so obviously that
        helped with atmosphere & service but the staff was still very friendly.
        Food presentation was great and tasted even better! This will definitely
        be one of our new sushi spots!!

        Went here with my wife because we wanted sushi and loved everything.
        They have these awesome boxes for lunch specials that was delicious!
        Service was great and all the food was full of flavor and tasted fresh.


        We drank water, had an appetizer, got two lunch boxes and added a mango
        roll and our bill was only $33. We were impressed.


        We will be back!

        Absolutely do not go here if you have gluten allergies. They do not list
        everything that they put into the rolls. Both my rolls had some form of
        gluten in them, crunchies and fried shrimp. Neither were listed on the
        ingredients for the rolls. I should have listened to the other reviewer
        saying they don’t care about allergies. My family didn’t even eat any of
        the things they ordered because they said it was gross and not fresh at
        all. Save your money and eat at Sushi Totto. Much fresher and cleaner.

        We love this place! The sushi is great! They are fast and always impress
        with their presentation. This place is the perfect sushi bar for us. We
        don’t like the fancy, we love the hole in the wall type. This isn’t hole
        in the wall by any means, just not fancy. Come and enjoy some sushi!!!
