        Random stop for sushi. The menu is more extensive than just sushi. It’s
        perfect for everyone reference. The miso soup and little green salad are
        perfect to my taste buds: not too salty, not sour and full of sesame
        dressing. Fried rice is very fragrant with basil leaves aroma. Not salty
        at all tiny bit oily but it was not saturated

        I recently dined at a restaurant that came highly recommended, and while
        the overall dining experience was good, the dishes didn't quite meet my
        high expectations. The Chirashi bowl was fresh, and the sashimi had a
        good texture, although I'd had better elsewhere. Similarly, the Peking
        Duck Roll was acceptable but not exceptional. The restaurant offers
        various dishes from different Asian cuisines for those interested in
        exploring beyond Japanese cuisine.

        Went here for a quick lunch on a Thursday. Not crowded and service was a
        little slow.  Chirashi and the lunch box tempura was ok. Miso soup was
        tepid and very salty. This restaurant has been here a long time and the
        decor  shows it.

        First time at the place but definitely becomes one of our go to sushi
        places. The service was welcoming and attentive. It was more noticeable
        when we brought back with us the leftovers and how they nicely wrapped
        and boxed the food. If you are looking for an average but decent sushi
        that not break the bank this is the place.
