        Informal dining. Bar area was popular.
        $200 for 2 people with a $50 bottle of wine.
        Seems to be the going cost in Parkcity
        Fried green tomato salad was excellent.
        Large portions. Interesting menu.

        I'm a certified Sommolier level 2 and Weset 3 diploma holder and love
        going to local places when I travel and I'm no stranger to park city and
        it's nice offerings!


        The decor and vibe of the place is very comfortable and while the staff
        might not be super educated in their food/drinks list they are good with
        food/drink recommendations and give you a warm smile with fast service.


        Started with Champagne for the table and they don't have the best glass
        wear for the wines they carry but that doesn't matter too much...she
        opened that cork silently and provided me with an ice bucket so I was
        pleased.


        Service is fast and the food is fantastic with solid presentations, was
        also nice we were easily seated as a larger party. The sourdough bread
        for the table is so soft and very tasty.  The Snakeriver Filet is
        absolutely delicious so much flavor and was perfectly medium rare (melts
        in your mouth), I also asked for the green beans which were excellent.
        The Dreamloaf is also very good but wow that Cream spinach is maybe the
        best I've ever had! The crispy pork belly dumplings are tasty with a
        fitting sauce.

        I think one of the most surprising things was the freshness of the
        sushi, the menu has so much variety but it was actually all good having
        ordered quite a few different things. Also they use real wasabi not
        horseradish and the sauces were pleasing to all the options we had on
        the table.


        Dessert list is better than almost every other average restaurant with
        lots of solid coffee and dessert wine options! My god the frozen lemon
        pie is so good, the lychee sorbet is divine and the Coffee ice cream
        with the brownie is just a perfect paring.


        Overall, this is a great place lots of variety with great options, good
        wines, and friendly service that is quick. Only thing that I didn't like
        was the cocktails that did get ordered specifically the espresso martini
        was not good, the old fashioned was fine just not great.

        Love this place! Our server, Christine from Romania was highly
        knowledgeable about the diverse menu and she was just delightful. Since
        we are fortunate to have excellent sushi back east, we did not know what
        to expect. Our two rolls were large and delicious and so were the
        cauliflower dish and pork dumplings. My husband had the banana foster
        and he enjoyed it. I finished my meal with the cucumber salad. We liked
        this place so much that we were quick to make another reservation during
        our stay in Park City.

        the best you could wish for! Be sure to ask for her or say hello when
