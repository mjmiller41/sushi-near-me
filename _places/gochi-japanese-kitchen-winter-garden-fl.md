        My first time here and it didn't disappoint however it took them well
        over 30 minutes to make 2 poke bowls.  I will add that it was definitely
        worth the wait. I had the tuna/salmon and my daughter had the spicy
        pork...both were mouth-watering. I gave them 5* for service because they
        couldn't apologize anymore than they did and offered us a soft drink
        while we waited which I thought was kind of them otherwise it would have
        been 3* Can't wait to go back!

        I took the team there after work. We had a great experience. The sushi
        and the drink were on point and our server David did a great job.  He
        was very knowledgeable about all the types is sushi. I told him to give
        me his favorite and he was able to pick  the crunchy crunch roll. That’s
        my new favorite .

        Continuing my search for the best Japanese Bento Box lunch in the
        Horizon West area, and discovered Gochi Japanese Kitchen via Google, and
        so glad I did!  It's one of those places you might never know is there,
        in a small strip mall off of Hwy 50 (W. Colonial), with almost nothing
        to tell you it's there driving by, as it doesn't face the main street. 
        It's much larger inside than it looks from outside, as others have said,
        and it's clean and inviting... a legit restaurant vs so many storefront
        places intended more for to go orders.


        Upon being seated, I noticed there was a central hibachi grill in the
        middle of the booth table.  Apparently, this place offers DIY hibachi
        grilling, but I did note the menu stated that if the table did not order
        at least 4 proteins (they looked to be about $15 each), there would be
        an additional $15 charcoal (fuel) charge.  A bit steep, in my opinion,
        especially if I would be expected to cook my own food, but I wasn't
        having hibachi at the time. Just thought I'd mention it, because it
        seems like a novel idea, and not too many places offer this feature.


        Gochi has a nice menu, and reasonably priced bento boxes.  I found it a
        bit odd that, when deciding on the traditional teriyaki chicken box, I
        had to choose between 4 small pieces of California roll OR steamed white
        rice (I've never been anywhere that didn't include both).  The box also
        included 1 piece of gyoza, 1 very small veggie spring roll; I chose the
        CA roll, and it also included the standard ginger salad.  I went ahead
        and ordered a side of steamed white rice (who doesn't want rice, without
        having to miss out on the CA roll?).  The other thing that struck me as
        a bit odd - no miso soup with a bento box?


        OK, all that being said... the food.  Despite being a bit surprised at
        no rice and CA roll together, and no miso soup, the quality of the
        food... for the most part, amazing!  Most bento box chicken is plain
        grilled or sautéed chicken with teriyaki sauce.  Gochi's stands out
        because it's sautéed, fresh, well-prepared chicken, mixed with sautéed
        veggies.  VERY flavorful, VERY fresh, and not at all oily.  So many
        places have bland offerings, but Gochi's flavors are incredible, and
        despite any of the minor, aforementioned misgivings about the bento box
        offerings, it's the quality and taste of the food that will keep me
        coming back for more!


        One more thing... the server.  David was covering the entire restaurant
        (it wasn't too busy just after lunch hour, but still maybe 25-30 people
        at multiple tables).  David HUSTLES!!  He's so fast, watching him, he
        was literally everywhere at once, and still took the time to talk with
        each table, checking in, answering questions about the menu, describing
        the details and flavors of each dish people  asked about... really
        impressive!


        I asked David if he was the owner - because it takes a special kind of
        person to take such good care of customers, with a well-defined
        knowledge of the menu, preparations, etc., to help people decide what
        they might like.  David said he wasn't the owner, but had been in the
        industry for over 30 years!  Honestly, he made the experience even
        better, which was much appreciated.


        One serious critique, Gochi... ditch the tap water!  Disgusting, even
        after adding lemon, and I order water with lemon everywhere I eat. 
        PLEASE source your water from your filtered soda machine, or invest in a
        purification system.  Honestly, the horrible tap water flavor could've
        ruined an otherwise excellent meal.


        So glad I tried Gochi (I just won't order water again... seriously, it
        was that bad)... but I will be back for the food (and hopefully David's
        excellent service), and I'd even like to try the DIY hibachi sometime...
        maybe with more people so we'd cover the 4 meat minimum.


        PS:  Sorry, but I was so hungry, and it smelled so good, that I started
        eating before I took the pictures.  There were actually 4 small CA roll
        pieces, and the gyoza and small eggroll.  By the time I took this
        picture, I'd poured my side of rice into the bento box.

        The rolls were really tasty, I'd even say delightfully delicious. My
        wife and I often enjoy sushi and rolls. I would definitely come back to
        this place. However, we live in Miami and just stopped by for lunch on
        the way. There's a huge parking lot. The dining area is clean, with
        plenty of space. The service is friendly and fast. We really enjoyed it.
        Definitely recommend it.
