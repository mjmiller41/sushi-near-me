        I took a sushi combo for 16.5$. There were total 16 small sushis.


        These sushis were pretty decent. It was bit smaller than the regular
        size. But I enjoyed it.

        This miserable poke bowl was $19 before Tip. I have been coming here for
        years and thought they were expensive but it has really gone down hill.
        Maybe the other sushi place inside is better, I hope so. Go to Publix,
        you’ll be happier

        A Letdown at Bento Sushi + Poke: A Review


        My dining experience was far from what I had anticipated, and
        unfortunately, it left a lot to be desired. The establishment, which
        promotes itself as a purveyor of fine sushi, missed the mark on several
        fundamental aspects of a satisfying dining experience.


        **Customer Service: A Missed Opportunity for Engagement**


        One of the most glaring issues was the lack of customer service. In an
        era where dining is not just about food but the experience, they seemed
        to forget the basics of hospitality. Despite opting for self-service,
        there's an expectation of minimal interaction, especially in a setting
        where chefs and customers share the same space. The complete absence of
        engagement—no greetings, no acknowledgment, not even a simple 'thank
        you'—felt cold and unwelcoming. This oversight turned what could have
        been a warm, inviting dining experience into a transaction devoid of any
        personal touch.


        **Sushi Selection: A Surface Variety**


        The restaurant boasts a diverse sushi menu, but this claim doesn't hold
        up under scrutiny. Despite a seemingly extensive list of rolls, the
        variety is superficial at best. The options quickly reveal themselves to
        be variations on a very limited theme, fitting into just one or two
        categories. This lack of genuine variety is a significant disappointment
        for any sushi enthusiast looking to explore a range of flavors and
        textures.


        **Portion Size vs. Price: An Imbalance**


        The portion size of the rolls further compounds the issue. They are
        surprisingly small, particularly when you consider the premium pricing.
        This imbalance between the amount of food and the cost is jarring,
        making it difficult to justify the expense. Dining out, especially at a
        sushi restaurant, is expected to be a treat—a balance of quality,
        quantity, and cost and unfortunately fails to deliver on this front,
        which left me feeling short-changed.


        **Sushi Quality: An Unpleasant Surprise**


        Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the meal was the sushi itself.
        The rice, arguably the cornerstone of any sushi roll, was flavored in an
        unconventional manner that was, frankly, off-putting. This unexpected
        taste overshadowed the quality of the ingredients, making the rolls
        difficult to enjoy. Sushi rice should enhance the flavor of the seafood
        and other components, not detract from it. This fundamental misstep in
        preparation was a significant detractor from the overall quality of the
        meal.


        **Conclusion: Unlikely to Return**


        Considering these factors—the stark lack of customer service, the
        illusion of variety, the poor value for money, and the disappointing
        quality of the sushi—I find it hard to recommend. The dining experience
        fell short of expectations on many levels, and with so many other
        options available, I see no reason to return. For those seeking a
        memorable sushi experience, it may be wise to look elsewhere, where the
        balance of quality, service, and value is better maintained. I hope they
        take this genuine feedback and make positive changes for a better dining
        experience in the future.

        Located inside of Plant Street Market in Winter Garden.  This is not
        your typical Bento Kitchen with full noodles and veggies, but it is a
        nice sushi/poke bowl addition to the other vendors at the market. The
        menu is limited, and I was surprised to see that the veggie roll or any
        veggie/vegan option was not part of the menu here. The staff was super
        nice and custom made something, but would be nice if they had the
        traditional veggie roll here as well.
