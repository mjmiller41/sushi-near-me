        All you can eat lunch for $16.99 is an amazing deal. Beware of paying
        for anything you don't eat!! Read the menu. There are rules that need to
        be followed.

        It's my favorite place to stuff myself until I'm sick and the hosts are
        always so kind! When they see that I'm at my limit they encourage me to
        take my time and then get this sick sense of enjoyment from seeing me
        slip in and out of a food induced coma. 10/10 love this place with my
        whole heart!

        The food here was delicious! Staff was fast and very attentive. I highly
        recommend this restaurant. You will not be disappointed at what you
        receive for the price. Unlimited sushi, meat, noodles, and soup! Just
        make sure you order what you will eat-because they will charge you if
        you dispose of too much food (did not happen to me, but seen it happen
        to someone).


        Give it a try!

        Some of the best sushi you can get in Buffalo and they serve these at an
        All You Can Eat Restaurant!!!


        For 25.99 for Adults , this menu is a steal if you like Sushi Rolls .


        We ordered the Volcano, Summer, Sea Angel & Autumn rolls and each one
        was brilliant.


        For appetizers you just have to order the Crab Rangoons which were
        delicious!


        And of course Hot Sake to wash it all down !


        It was a wholesome meal for us and since we were 2 , we couldn’t order
        their rice or noodles which a lot of people were going for !


        Be sure not to leave any leftovers as you may be charged for those .


        Overall , definitely recommend for their great Sushi Rolls !!

        First time dining here and I was somehow unaware that this is a All You
        Can Eat restaurant. We had a great experience here.


        The food quality was surprisingly good for how inexpensive the price to
        dine is. The miso soup had nice flavors. The rolls were fresh but I
        wasn't a big fan of the Las Vegas roll. It didn't really have a taste to
        it.


        The service was decent but not the best. We were able to get a table
        right away. Our waitress was nice but was hard to understand with her
        accent. The wait for our food were inconsistent. Most arrived in a
        reasonable time. The last roll took much longer than expected. The quick
        refills on water was great though.


        I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this location. The space is big and
        well decorated. There's also TVs hung up around to stare at.


        It wasn't the perfect experience but it was good enough for me to think
        about going back. 9/10 stars
