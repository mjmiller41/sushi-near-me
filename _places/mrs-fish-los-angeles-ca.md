        A very trendy and bustling spot! While waiting for our table at Mrs.
        Fish, we enjoyed a drink at their sister restaurant, Perch—a great
        option I’d recommend. Parking can be tricky, but we got lucky with a
        metered spot right across the street. I'll let the photos speak for
        themselves—we ordered the chef’s tasting menu along with a few extra
        dishes. I couldn’t resist capturing plenty of content!

        Omg the best experience I have had by far in a bar in DTLA . Going in I
        was welcomed by the lovely security Jeremy who talked to me about their
        bars and the bartender Yutajaro. He made the most delightful cocktails
        whiskey drinks ever. He is patient and very knowledgeable about flavors
        and alcohol. He knew how to balance each ingredient and made my husband
        feel so special for his birthday ! A 10/10 . Thank you so much to all
        the beautiful staff. Lots of steps to go up and down worth it with the
        fish tanks and decor .

        I came here for my birthday dinner! I had never heard of this place
        before. It's right next door to the Perch in Los AngeParking - street
        parking available if you're lucky, otherwise, I used valet. It was $15
        for valet and they have an app where you can request your car about 10
        min prior to you leaving. The restaurant seats you once your entire
        party is there. You can wait at the cute bar they have and order a drink
        while you wait. The decor inside is stunning! We were lucky at got to
        sit right under the fish tank. Service was OK. Everyone was friendly for
        the most part, but I did have them box my food and didn't end up
        receiving it when l left, they threw it away. I was very upset about
        that. Otherwise, it was a good experience. They let us bring in a cake
        from outside for my birthday. It's definitely worth a shot if you're in
        the area.


        Food and drink review:

        Chika: (5/5) delicious mocktail. Flavors blended well together.


        Spicy green beans: (4/5) I wanted to love them, but they were just Ok.
        They were very hard to chew, but had a nice kick to them.


        Salmon carpaccio: (4/5) These had great flavor but portion was tiny for
        the price.


        Rainbow roll, salmon avocado, and California roll: These were all
        delicious!! The fish was fresh and they were pretty big pieces.


        Karaage skewer: (5/5) These were yummy. They had good texture and
        flavor. Dipping sauce was tasty too. 3 in one serving for all skewers.

        Porkbelly skewer: (5/5) Super good! Great flavor.


        Shrimp skewer: (5/5) everyone devoured these ones fast!

        Seared tuna crispy rice: (5/5) These were my favorite.

        Omg so good and the sauce on top was delicious!


        Edamame: (5/5) Overall good flavor. The spicy chili one was yummy!


        Miso cod: (2/5) The fish was cooked well but was topped with some aioli
        sauce that killed the flavor. We ended up sending it back.


        Brisket: (4/5) This was super tasty! It was tender and flavors blended
        well together.


        Short rib: (5/5) This was bomb. My favorite dish. The potatoes and meat
        were a fantastic combo. l'd definitely order again.


        Pork belly ramen: (5/5) The broth was unique. I never tried ramen like
        that before. It was super good!

        The atmosphere is so beautiful and very relaxing.  I highly recommend
        this restaurant. The waiter was the sweetest 💕 very attentive.

        Drinks are delicious, and there's a variety to choose from.

        This was my first time going after wanting to go for quite some time. We
        had drinks at Perch prior to our reservation at Mrs. Fish. The server
        was VERY knowledgeable about the menu and very helpful with making
        selections. The food selections were good. The drinks were nice.
        Desserts were amazing - I will think of wasabi and chocolate in a very
        different way. The sound system is quite nice. Good vibe in the place.
        The art is eclectic, but those fish tanks!
