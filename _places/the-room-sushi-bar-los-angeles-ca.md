        Overall a really nice and casual sushi restaurant in the Westwood area.
        I am giving it a 4/5 because there are a few more other sushi spots that
        I like more in the immediate area, but this place is still worth
        visiting. It’s very bright on the inside and there’s actually a lot of
        seating available. Service was really fast but we ordered appetizers and
        entrées, but they ended up bringing everything at once, which I was
        hoping to avoid. They don’t have a parking lot, but it was easy to find
        metered street parking right out front.


        They have a fairly extensive menu with a lot of the classics. They
        actually do have a great selection of choices. I started off with the
        clam miso soup, which was really nice and warm and a good start to the
        meal. Next came the softshell crab, which I thought was pretty good,
        although it was more fried than I like and I find it better when the
        crab is kept intact. Next came The Room Special Roll, which was very
        good, the Zumba Zumba roll, which was nice with the warm langostine on
        top, and some assorted nigiri.


        In the end I would recommend to any sushi fan, especially if you are in
        the area.

        You want sushi? You want lots of sushi options? You want decent prices?
        This is your place. Nothing fancy.  Nothing out of this world. It’s just
        good decent sushi. They have a cash discount. Give this place a try.
        It’s a great neighborhood sushi spot. I went with my three little kids
        and they enjoyed it.

        We have been coming here for years. Overtime the service got a little
        worse and the staff a little less friendly, but tonight was the worst
        experience. First the waiters didn’t even care to smile once. Then when
        I asked for a ponzu sauce, the waitress told me she would charge me for
        it 50 cents. Obviously, this had never happened before and obviously we
        don’t care about a 50 cent charge on an order for a family of 4. But the
        unfriendliness together with a charge for ponzu (while soy sauce seems
        to be ok) is just too much.

        This was the last time we went there and would not recommend them
        anymore either.

        I recommend to everyone!
