        I went here with a group of friends and we had a great time. The food is
        quite tasty with generous portions at an affordable price. Our server (I
        believe her name was Annie on the receipt) was very friendly and even
        helped us take our group photo at the end of our visit. I definitely
        recommend a visit!

        We just ordered for the first time to try a different place than our
        usuals (Matata and Takumi) and it was TERRIBLE. The quality of food was
        awful and all the rolls fell apart. And overall, it cost 1.5-2x more
        than our usuals. We will not order from here again.

        Well I finally went. And I needed time to get my thoughts in order…
        Ultimately, it never reached the pinnacle that, in my mind, OSHO had
        both in personal service, quality of fish, and simplicity of technique
        and sushi focus.

        I was first struck when we arrived by how clean and friendly it was, and
        how over half of the bustle was takeout…

        We started with an abundance of appetizers to get a sense of the
        atmosphere…


        The Salmon Tataki was superb. Perfectly sliced and with just the right
        amount of sauce. This was perhaps the star of the night.

        We also had the Gyoza… Again very nice but just a bit more spice would
        have been nice. I enjoyed the umami, but missed that tiny bit of punch.
        Still worth it.


        The edamame were good but lacked that extra saltiness I would have
        expected, but that is something of a personal preference. And then came
        the Rock Shrimp. This was on OSHO specialty and I was very disappointed
        at the Sono version. While the Shrimp were perfectly cooked, they had
        little spice and flavor of their own. And the breading was not crispy
        nor flavorful. The entire dish revolved around the sauce which was
        lacking in punch and was over dressed.


        We then ordered a large amount of Sushi since we wanted to sample
        everything… Even though we knew there would be leftovers… And we found
        some dynamite rolls and some just good rolls.


        To the left is the Incredible Roll, then the Crawfish Roll, and to the
        right the Hot Crunchy Crab. Way too match Krab and not nearly enough
        real crab to make the Incredible Roll incredible. It was just way over
        done. A little Krab goes a long way. And I would have thought the Hot
        Crunchy Crab would have been real crab but it too was not. It had the
        right amount of Krab so it wasn’t overwhelming, but it was lackluster at
        best. Then, with trepidation we tried the Crawfish Roll. Stunning.
        Wonderful spicy flavor and the crawfish was clearly able to take the
        starring role.

        Second course then arrived… Middletown Roll


        This time it was real Crab and deliciously smoked eel. And it would have
        been perfect where it not for an overwhelming chunk of avocado which
        took over the flavor profile. Though when removed left a wonderful roll.

        And finally the third course… Soft Shell, New York, and Sono Delight
        Rolls.


        The Sono Delight was just that, delightful with an excellent melding of
        flavors. Another winner. The New York was also very good with the unique
        flavor of Apple and Salmon. Very good but an acquired taste. And then
        the Soft Shell. Sigh. Once again the avocado dwarfed every other flavor
        out - notice the huge hunk on the one piece…

        Was it overall enjoyable? Yes. Will I go back? Yes but I will be more
        careful with what we order… And the pricing was a tad high. All in all,
        I will stick with the 3 roll lunch special at Kyoto. Not as fancy, and
        not as focused, but the fish is fresh and the bang for the buck is much
        better.
