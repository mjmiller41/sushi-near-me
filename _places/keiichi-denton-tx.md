        I somehow got lucky enough to get a single spot. He heard I was a single
        and said if I came at 5 I could get a seat.


        I found out later that the entire year of 2025 is booked. It took one
        week to fill up.


        That's the reputation the man has built. And I say well deserved.


        The food was amazing and the service too.

        Everything was great and 10/10 would do it again.

        Fantastic Sushi restaurant....one of my favorite for authentic, fresh
        and high end sushi. They have a long wait for reservations, but worth
        the wait. Due to Covid their seating is very limited. Call ahead and get
        a reservation, you won’t regret it.

        The beef roll and trout sashimi are too die for. The service was very
        friendly, the chef made incredible suggestions, the waitress was super
        efficient and the food was reasonably priced for the quality of
        fish/ingredients. A meal like this at Nobu would have been twice the
        price with perhaps lesser quality ingredients.

        The portions are very generous and filling.


        A must try place if you are a sushi 🍣 fan.

        Absolutely the best Japanese restaurant in DFW area. This restaurant
        looks so unassuming from outside but once you get in, you feel like
        being in Japan. The food is so amazing. It is an interesting combination
        of Japanese and Italian. Every dish is great. The seafood is so fresh.
        Remember to reserve two months in advance.

        What a special restaurant! Will come back again and again!

        Once you go to Keiichi, you basically won't trust anyone else to give
        this kind of quality, authentic sushi anywhere else. This isn't your
        typical sushi joint, either. Even sushi chefs from Dallas come to Denton
        to eat here. It's a hole-in-the-wall, easily overlooked sushi restaurant
        right off the Denton Square, and he just recently put out a sign to
        advertise his long-time business location. Book in advance! Only open
        Wed-Sat I think and only takes reservations by phone.


        Keiichi (the owner's name) is the only sushi chef there and cooks right
        in front of you. The prices aren't cheap but I've never been more
        satisfied about spending $75-100 per person at any restaurant, ever, and
        gladly give up my wallet to eat his sushi.


        My all time favorites are the beef and jalepeno cream cheese rolls
        (OMGGG), beef tataki, and any of the sashimi plates. My husband and I
        did the "chefs special" on a special occasion and got to try many of his
        incredibly fresh and delicious sashimi (that I probably normally
        wouldn't have the courage to order) and it was so worth it — definitely
        expanded my palette to develop a new love of sushi. But I don't really
        trust eating sashimi / raw fish anywhere else because I know his fish is
        top notch quality. It's such a treat coming here every time.


        Also it's pretty casual and not a fancy place, so all are welcome.

        Keiichi is by far the best restaurant in Denton. It is always worth the
        wait. The owners + staff are incredibly friendly, and the food is
        consistently creative, gorgeous, and delicious. I literally have dreams
        about the squid sashimi and sea trout. They serve pasta and INCREDIBLE
        steak. Also they have a bidet? When I talk about why I live in Denton I
        always mention this place.
