        Absolutely a must visit in San Francisco. The menu and flow is well
        paced and relaxing yet, doesn’t leave you hanging for the next dish.
        Presentation is elegant and every bite was so fresh. The servers are
        very well trained and versed in the origins of each offering. Our
        favourite was the Hokkaido scallop with uni and the chawan mushi with
        smoked trout caviar. The wine menu is small but superbly curated. Sake
        menu is extensive. Well worth the price for a wonderful experience

        We had an amazing experience here last night for my birthday. This is a
        tightly run ship, with coordinated seatings and a beautiful ambiance.
        The bathroom is even beautiful with a bidet and a pleasant scent (I
        know, but it was impressive). The full omakase was almost too much food
        for me, with 3 courses of 4 bites of sushi plus so much more. The drink
        pairings were pricey so instead I recommend the sake flight. They
        surprised us with a candle and card to celebrate my birthday, with a
        gift of a little yuzu soda to take home! I even left my purse at the
        restaurant on accident and they called me within 5 minutes to come back
        for it. It’s an expensive night out but if it’s a special occasion they
        will make it worthwhile.

        Wonderful experience. We opted for a bottle of sake and the gentleman
        allowed us to try four different ones to determine what we would
        like--how lovely is that?!


        Leonardo our sushi chef, was absolutely gifted as well as sweet and
        genuine. He made beautiful bites and we enjoyed 90% of them. He even
        substituted a dish for me since I'm not a fan of sea urchin, though I
        tried it again. I didn't need to do it twice in one evening.


        The place was great! The fish fresh! Would definitely come back!  Also
        lovely ambiance.

        Food was great.  The chef asked us if we have any favorites and he gave
        us a good mix of fatty and lean fish/cuts for the sushi.  Loved the
        umami of the chawan mushi, which was the first dish.  The variety of
        textures and flavors on the appetizer tray had us eagerly anticipating
        the sushi course.  We had the petite omakase with a wagyu add-on, and
        that was filling


        Minus one star because of the service.  Dishes came out at just the
        right pace, but our server talked too fast that we can’t understand what
        she was saying.  It was a full bar the night we were there and the space
        was a little too tight.  I’ve sat at the bar for omakase in the past, at
        least 2-3 times including in Japan, and I don’t remember them being this
        tight.  Not a dealbreaker though, and would still come back

        KUSAKABE is authentically amazing! I spent 3 years traveling to and from
        Japan in my mid-20s on a mission to find the best sushi in the
        world...from high class dining on the streets of Fukuoka, to "chefs
        choice" roulette in private gardens outside Kyoto, and down onto the
        very shipyard docks in Tokyo where they unload the fish. In all my time
        before those trips, and since, I was never able to find a sushi
        restaurant that could measure up ... until KUSAKABE.


        The atmosphere, the quality of the fish, the service, the diversity of
        flavors, the careful preparation of every bite...perfection! I would
        have sworn I was back in Japan if it weren't for all the English on the
        menu and the English speaking staff explaining the each course.


        I definitely suffered a bunch of sticker shock at the fixed price menu,
        but after my experience, I had to accept that it was not only fair, but
        necessary. While the cost of a dinner for four here can cost as much as
        a new smartphone (or even more!), that dinner is a whole heck of a lot
        cheaper than buying an airplane ticket to Japan in order to find
        anything close to this authentic. And with the intimate, high diversity,
        fixed course experience that they serve, the price is a necessary to
        cover their costs of staff and low table turnover.


        If you are a sushi snob (like me), you will not be disappointed. If you
        want to eat sushi like you would in the best sushi restaurants in Japan,
        you will save yourself a ton of time and money to go here. If you want
        to impress business partners with a fancy dinner, there is almost no
        better way. And if you simply want to have a quiet intimate date night,
        the atmosphere and service here will hit the spot just right.
