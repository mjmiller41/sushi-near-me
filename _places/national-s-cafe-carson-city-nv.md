        Despite the Cafe's misleading name, an obsequious one that let me
        overlook the fact that this place is an Asian restaurant, I came here
        for some chicken teriyaki. What they served me was excellent!


        I had a bit of craving for the teriyaki for a good while, and theirs hit
        the spot! The miso soup was a welcome addition to my meal.


        I do have minor criticism about one thing that I had there. The gyoza
        were a bit too light on the filling. However, they were crispy and
        tasty, nonetheless!


        All of my food was well presented, and they included a refreshing
        cucumber salad with a vinegary flavor. It had a peculiar topping that I
        couldn't quite identify. Imitation crab, maybe? I'm no expert on
        shellfish, nor imitation, so I can't tell you what they topped it with.


        Since my grandfather was allergic to shellfish, in general, and my
        family didn't eat it often, I just avoid it these days. I still tried a
        taste of it. Looking at the picture, someone might be able to guess what
        it is. I have no opinion about its flavor.


        Years ago, this place used to be a sandwich shop when I was younger.
        While I miss enjoying that business's food, particularly their French
        Dips with chips, I've gained a new restaurant's food to enjoy for what
        they offer; some really good teriyaki! Change doesn't have to be
        frightening!


        PS: The service was excellent. The woman who served my table brought
        everything in intervals. I didn't have to wait too long for anything.
        The asian cuisine program they had up on the tv was interesting too! It
        was probably one of the most deaf-friendly forms of entertainment I can
        think of, not to mention interesting for being foreign content and
        subtitled as a matter!

        I had the opportunity to enjoy several sushi rolls, tempura shrimp and
        miso soup. The best is the long Nevada roll that is crystal shrimp,
        jalapeno topped w/ cilantro, avocado, snapper, lemon.  Never had tasted
        something like that.  The owners are super friendly and very affordable
        prices.  Give a try or call for take out.

        husband who has a severe onion allergy, and me who can’t eat meat due to
        a kidney condition, made us custom special food then charged us less
        than we should have paid! Make sure you too big because these guys treat
        you like royalty! Thank you from your BLM wild horse friends from
        California!

        Got our dinner to go. There was a long wait but it was totally worth it.
        Delicious sushi and plenty for three people. Very good service as well.
        They took our phone number and called us when our order was ready so we
        didn't have to stand around waiting for it. Next time we will order
        ahead.
