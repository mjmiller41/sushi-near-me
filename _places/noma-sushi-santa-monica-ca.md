        Hidden gem in Santa Monica!

        We stumbled upon this amazing Japanese restaurant while visiting Santa
        Monica with our family, including seniors and kids. It turned out to be
        one of the highlights of our trip. The ingredients were incredibly
        fresh, and every dish was beautifully presented and full of flavor—from
        sashimi and sushi rolls to hot dishes like beef bowls and crispy
        karaage.


        The variety was impressive, and everything tasted authentic and
        well-balanced. Even our kids, who usually have small appetites, couldn’t
        stop eating!


        If you're looking for a cozy, delicious, and family-friendly Japanese
        spot in Santa Monica, don’t miss this place. It truly deserves more
        recognition!

        This is one of my favorite sushi spot in west LA! The sushi and sashimi

        enjoying dining in. Make sure to check in at Yelp when u r near by
        because there’s a lot of people during lunch and dinner.

        Great sushi spot! They do offer a very large variety on their menu from
        fish to bento (with meat) to different types of rolls.


        You need to sign in outside for your party to be added to the waiting
        list, and once it is your turn they will come up to you. They have a
        system and just make sure you respect that as the entrance would get
        crowded very fast.


        For the food, we have our regulars items that we like to order. I do
        tend to order a bit too much - I feel portion are very decent. It has
        always been good and refreshing place.

        The crispy rice I prefer when they are smaller.

        My friends took us to this incredible Japanese restaurant in Santa
        Monica, and wow! This place has been a local icon since 1973, and it’s
        easy to see why it’s still packed decades later.


        We arrived at 4 pm and walked right in (pro tip: avoid peak lunch/dinner
        hours if you hate waiting!). Many regulars here are Japanese locals
        who’ve been dining here for years, which is always a good sign.


        We ordered their bento boxes, and let me tell you—they’re a steal at
        just over $20! Each box was packed with fresh, flavorful dishes, all
        perfectly balanced and hearty enough to leave us stuffed.


        If you’re craving an authentic Japanese experience in Santa Monica
        without breaking the bank, this spot is a must-visit. Affordable,
        delicious, and oozing with charm—you can’t go wrong here!

        Let me start by saying, I am not a sushi guy. I always had that barrier
        of eating raw seafood. I came here with a friend who promised they have
        cooked sushi. He ordered bunch of things that I didn’t even understand,
        some of them were cooked and the others were raw. He tricked me into
        eating some of the raw options, and oh my! It was fantastic!! No fishy
        taste at all, which was surprising to me. The place looks extremely
        authentic and ambience is excellent!!! Staff were extremely friendly and
        helpful. I loved everything about that place. 10/10. Would I come here
        again? Hell yeah!!
