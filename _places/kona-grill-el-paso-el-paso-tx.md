        It was a little tight for spacing. The food was good but on the salty
        side. Our server was a little busy, probably because there were a lot of
        us and the place was quite packed, but she was very nice and
        accommodating. We loved the wines.

        It was a good experience. Definitely coming back on a regular day.

        🧐 Interesting how almost all reviews are 5 stars.  🌟  yelp reviews are
        more accurate in this occasion.  Glad I was not crazy with my 2 stars.
        This place, is overpriced by a lot.  Based on prices, you would think
        you are at some luxury restaurant. Unfortunately you are not. It’s a
        shopping center restaurant.  A nice one shopping center restaurant.

        Been there 3 times. They have a cloudy unlit fish tank that looks like a
        hole in the wall Asian restaurant fish tank.  Looks kinda dirty.


        Our waitress was nice.  I did have to ask passing staff for something
        twice. I got a Pad Thai. It was good for El Paso.  The sushi, 🍣,  not
        so much.  I am a big fan of sushi.  (Try Albertsons fresh sushi.)


        The  side plates had some black cloudy staining and oil in the center. 
        My wife initially said it was the color of the plate, but once I smudged
        it with my finger she agreed with me.  It was like a cloudy smoke color
        on those plates.


        The decor lacks luxury.  Lacks the nightlife vibe. The wood decor, just
        does not get it done. People are not taking a picture to post on social
        media at Kona Grill because it doesn’t look impressive in pictures. Hype
        and decor is important for a restaurant, especially if they charge so
        much for food.  Look at menu prices before you go.  Luxury prices
        without a luxury experience. Pad Thai was like $35.


        Lastly the drink, it was mostly ice, two straw sips and it was done. 
        Maybe this is as good as it gets for El Paso.

        My husband and I went to Kona for my birthday and it was one of the best
        dining experiences of my life. Our server Daniela was so kind and
        friendly and even had a bump-friendly sushi roll made especially for me.
        The food was unbelievably flavorful and unique, we were blown away by
        everything. We can’t wait to return!

        I spent nearly $30 on just 5 small pieces of sushi at Kona Grill, and
        honestly, I expected way better for the price. The rolls were
        underwhelming… poorly made, lacking flavor, and definitely not worth
        what they charge. I’ve had better sushi at places that cost half as
        much. The server was okay..not rude or anything, just not very attentive
        or memorable. Overall, pretty disappointed with the experience,
        especially considering how hyped up this place is. Not sure I’d come
        back for sushi again.
