        Overall: 4.5/5.0

        ________________________________________

        *Food:

        1. Agedashi Tofu & Kirimochi

        - Light batter on tofu and kirimochi, but enough to soak up the tempura
        sauce.

        - Kirimochi and tofu were both soft and chewy with a crispy exterior.

        - 10/10


        2. Lobster Kara Age

        - Just what you would expect from Kara Age, crispy and juicy. Not too
        oily, not too much batter.

        - Yuzu mayo covers the oiliness of the fried lobster. Citrus sauce is
        not overwhelming.

        - 10/10


        3. Sushi & Sashimi Combo (Sushi)

        - Excellent quality sashimi grade fish. No fishy aftertaste, rice was
        not overly sweet or salty and not overcooked. Fish slice size was larger
        and thicker compared to other restaurants.

        - 10/10


        4. Sushi & Sashimi Combo (Sashimi)

        - Excellent quality sashimi grade fish. Hamachi was extra fatty and had
        amazing texture. Akami was not fishy at all, texture was great.

        - White fish on the side with yuzu sauce was a little fishy. Could
        improve, but overall an amazing dish with thick cut sashimi. Definitely
        satisfied expectations.

        - 8.5/10


        5. Otoro Tuna Sashimi

        - Market price; reasonable price for the thick cut and quality.

        - Melts in your mouth, no fishy aftertaste.

        - Ordered after checking the fish quality from the sushi & sashimi
        combo. I had high expectations and the expectations were met. Great
        slices of fish.

        10/10

        ________________________________________

        *Service:

        - Reservation was 6:30pm, but due to traffic, I arrived 15 minutes late.
        I had called in beforehand, which they kindly let us in despite the
        delay. Once seated and ordered at 7:00pm, pre-dinner sides, miso soup,
        and water were provided. Appetizers came out 10 minutes later, sashimi
        and sushi came out 10 minutes after the appetizers. Despite full
        seating, food came out fast, and of course with excellent plating and
        quality. Servers came around frequently to check on any needs. Overall,
        friendly servers, food quality is great.


        ________________________________________

        * Atmosphere:

        - Overall very much satisfied. For the price of the items, quality and
        quantity was assured and tasted great. Restaurant was clean and quiet
        despite the full seating. Again, friendly servers and excellent food
        quality as well as fast serving time. Portland never really had great
        sushi/sashimi, but I definitely recommend coming here at least once, as
        the items I have ordered tasted great. Many liquor choices(wine, beer,
        sake, cocktails, etc.) and good choice of desserts as well. Would
        recommend if you dislike fish due to its fishiness since the sashimi and
        sushi here have no unpleasant aftertaste.

        The best high quality sushi I've ever had!! The service is amazing,
        everyone is so kind and patient and the food is phenomenal. The takoyaki
        is like none I've ever had, perfect crunchy outside and gooey middle.
        Definitely a bit more on the higher end price wise but worth every penny
        and I'd go every day if I could! I dream of their poke... ❤️

        I visited this place for lunch and had an amazing experience. The bento
        lunch specials were really great. I especially appreciated that they had

        spicy tuna roll as an option at no extra charge. Many places include a
        California roll and charge extra to swap it out, so this was great to
        see.


        The tonkatsu was great as well, crispy on the outside and tender in the
        inside. I do have to say, the portions were a bit on the small side,
        wish it was a bit larger. The tempura was crisp and perfectly fried, and
        the bento also came with two pieces of gyoza, miso soup, and rice,
        making it a well-rounded meal.


        Service was prompt and friendly, even though the restaurant was quite
        busy. Glad we were able to find a really nice lunch spot. I’ll
        definitely be coming back more often and look forward to trying their
        sushi and rolls next time!

        dinnerware down to their choice of garnish, you can tell that a lot of
        love and thought went into every dish.
