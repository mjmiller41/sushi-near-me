        My favorite place for sushi. Absolutely incredible service. The food is
        excellent. The thing I specifically like about the place - quite vibe of
        classical music.

        This place makes the best Sushi rolls!! The portion sizes are huge, and
        we tried 3 different rolls, all of which were excellent. The rolls are
        filled with great quality sushi, tempura, avocado, and other fillings.
        They are full of flavor and filled to the brim with fish! Definitely the
        best rolls I’ve tried in Seattle, though I’ve been to plenty of sushi
        restaurants. The server was so kind and attentive, and the restaurant &
        bathroom were spotless. I would definitely come back here again!

        We ordered 10 items from this restaurant tonight. My friend, who was in
        Bellevue,  picked up the order and drove it to my house in Seattle,
        where she also lives. Upon opening thr bag and sorting through all of
        the food, we discovered that they had left out 2 Avocado Rolls. My
        friend called them and asked for a refund for those 2 rolls that she
        paid for, but which they didn't give her, and they told her they
        couldn't refund her.


        **Tl;dr: Don't eat here - if they leave food out of.your order, they
        will not refund you.**


        **Editing to respond to the restaurant's claim below that she asked for
        a full refund - no, she did not. I heard the whole conversation. You
        kept interrupting her when she tried to say "I'm asking for a refund for
        the 2 avocado rolls." You replied over and over that it is your policy 
        not to give any refunds.

        I love this place. Would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't next to the
        salon. Walking in was unpleasant due to the smell coming from the salon
        besides that the service was fast, super friendly, and delicious food.
        Everything we had was fresh, perfectly made, and delicious. We even
        ordered the two bento boxes to go. If you are on the hunt for a good
        sushi restaurant highly recommended this place.
