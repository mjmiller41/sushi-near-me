        SOPO was perfect for a prom dinner! The place was perfect for pictures
        and the workers were very attentive and patient with us. The food was
        absolutely delicious! We tried the Choo Choo roll and the Lickity Split
        roll, all had fresh fish and rice. Their crème brûlée was also very
        decadent and creamy! Overall an amazing experience. Would recommend for
        anyone wanting a higher end sushi restaurant with great food and vibes!

        Delicious sushi and drinks. I went around 7pm on a Wednesday and sat at
        the bar. It seems to fill up pretty nicely, so I’d recommend having a
        reservation. Parking was not bad and everyone inside was super friendly.
        I want to try out their happy hour, so I will def be back! Prices are
        GREAT. I have been quite a few sushi spots in the last few weeks and
        this was my smallest bill and I ordered about 6-8 pieces of nigiri, a
        drink and the blue crab fried rice. I want to try the bento boxes.

        Coming in hot with a rave review:

        I swear—I will NEVER get tired of the Kanpai Roll at Sushi on Post Oak!


        📍 Sushi on Post Oak, Houston, TX | @sopohouston


        Sushi on Post Oak saved our date night last night with excellent
        service, delicious food, and a dedication to ensuring a safe gluten-free
        dining experience.


        ✨ My favorite roll there (maybe even all-time) is the Kanpai Roll
        (gluten-free), which comes with spicy yellowtail, cucumber, and avocado
        inside, topped with amberjack, yuzu kosho, and candied jalapeño. I
        honestly think I could happily eat that every day with the sushi ginger
        for the rest of my life.


        🍣 My partner ordered one of his favorites, the Surf and Turf roll,
        which comes with lobster katsu, avocado, topped with Kobe beef, green
        onion, and a side of basil ponzu and black pepper sauce (disclaimer:
        this roll is NOT gluten-free).


        As always, we had an excellent experience at SOPO!


        However, for context: SOPO was our second stop for dinner last night
        because at a different sushi restaurant we went to beforehand, I was
        unfortunately glutened on the first bite of a cucumber salad that was on
        their supposedly “gluten-free menu.” The salad itself wasn’t just
        cross-contaminated—it was actually made with gluten-containing
        ingredients. So, we left immediately after that incident.


        Even at gluten “friendly” restaurants, I still have anxiety when eating
        out because of how easily mistakes can be made. I’m still feeling sick
        almost 24 hours after my initial exposure at the other restaurant.


        💛 This is why I’m so thankful for restaurants like SOPO, who go above
        and beyond to accommodate dietary needs and ensure a safe dining
        experience. Thanks again for an amazing night—I can’t wait to visit
        again soon!

        Our experience at SOPO was great! The sushi was top tier. We ordered the
        SOPO roll and the chocho roll. Both were delicious and the sushi rice
        was especially good. For dessert I ordered the creme brulee with berries
        and it had the perfect amount of sweetness. Julie and Mandy were very
        attentive and Mandy gave great recommendations. Overall we will
        definitely be back!
