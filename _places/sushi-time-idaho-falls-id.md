        That was the worst sushi I've ever had. I wanted to send back 2 out of 3
        rolls I ordered but since they charge you for not eating I didn't...


        Breaded Shrimp in a roll - Cold, hard, tasted awfulike it had been
        sitting there a LONG time. Had to pick it all out of the roll and it
        still made the whole roll taste bad.


        EEL - Ditto. Couldn't stand this and it made the whole roll taste bad.


        Tuna - I know it was tuna but it did not taste very fresh... Like maybe
        it has been sitting a very long time in the air.


        Spider Roll - this one was ok


        Other fish - Similar to the tuna. It's like they're letting the fish get
        warm or something


        Sauces - I had only one roll that looked like it had the sauces
        advertised. It's like they forgot half the ingredients of most of the
        rolls we ordered, either that or the food here is very plain.


        In general, most of the rolls had lots of rice and very little fish. The
        one in this review that *looks* good was actually pretty terrible
        because the breaded shrimp in it was so old. The other one had a large
        chunk of some hard, dry, unidentifiable white meat in it and nothing
        else.


        I forgot to mention the waitress was by far the worst server I've ever
        seen. She seemed genuinely upset that we were there and ordering food
        and messed up our order and forgot stuff no less than 8 times.

        Service was great. Very kind and explained the menu well (Auna)!!


        Flavor was a 6/10, if want for the sauce the rice would be TERRIBLE:
        more below


        Rice 1/10 dry and flavorless. Literally had to request extra sauce and
        drank water to get the fit down so we wouldn’t be charged extra.

        Best roll, protein, was a la carte.


        They ran out of pot stickers at 6pm!


        Sushi is about the rice and this place failed.

        Went to dinner with my mom tonight. I got the all you can eat sushi. Our
        server had to leave shortly after ordering our food. We got our
        appetizers just fine and it was all great up until then. We got a new
        server because the original had to leave. We waited 30 minutes for our
        sushi to come out. Turns out our order wasn’t even put in so we had to
        wait a few more minutes. I ordered another piece of sushi later and. I
        had approximately 9 pieces of sushi left and asked for a box. The serve
        told me it would be an extra charge for not finishing all but 3 pieces
        of sushi. She even apologized for this information not being relayed to
        us before ordering. The new server didn’t even know that I was the only
        one with the all you can eat sushi order until I told her. I told her I
        wouldn’t have even ordered my last sushi roll if I had known about the
        policy of finishing all but three pieces of sushi. She apologized and
        said the best she could do was only charge an extra $5 for not finishing
        it. She then stated the policy was started in the menu even though the
        original server should have explained to us the policy. Asked to speak
        to the manager and she explain the same thing but could clearly care
        less (even though we also waited 30 minutes son sushi that hadn’t even
        put in). Then to top things off my mother was charged twice for the same
        roll. The server said there was a piece of sushi left when the servers
        switched which was a complete lie and the servers part (or she’s a
        complete airhead). I felt completely unheard and uncared for. I have
        worked in the restaurant industry for over 10 years and I know for a
        fact that my managers would not have charged the extra $5 for not
        finishing the sushi simply for the fact we were not told about it, and
        we would have even been discounted for the inconvenience of having to
        wait over 30 minutes for our order being forgotten about. The manager
        did not care at all and charged us full price for everything plus the
        extra $5 for not finishing the sushi.  I have never experienced such
        poor hospitality by a manager in a restaurant. I do not blame the server
        (even though she wasn’t very bright) but I expect more from a manager.
        First and last time going to the place.. The only reason why they
        received two starts from me was because the other staff that was not our
        server was very caring and kind and the food was good. Zero starts for
        management. Shame on you.

        Worst sushi place ever. Idaho Falls has a very low bar for dinning
        industry and this place definitely reaches the lowest limit. Thank you
        for your effort. Although they say it is "all you can eat sushi," they
        have all kinds of condition to limit how many times we can order. Also,
        this place is more like "all you can eat rice" instead. Additionally,
        the rude server has mentioned five times about their leftover policies
        which is no more than 6 pieces. Sounds like people always had hard time
        finishing the food they order. That explains all how shitty the food is
        right?

  inconsistencies in preparation. Patrons frequently praise the beer and sake
  selections, adding to the enjoyable experience, though suggestions for quicker
  service come up now and then. If you're hunting for sushi restaurants near me,
