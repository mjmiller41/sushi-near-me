        Found this place through a Google search, and it was worth the detour.
        We visited twice in 12 days and went to one place - Jojo's barbecue. 
        Authentic Southern barbecue with mouth watering sides, particularly the
        mac and cheese and the home made corn bread. Jojo knows his stuff and,
        while fried chicken Mondays are good, the barbecue is my favorite.  I
        wish we lived nearer because there are more than 10 other food vendors
        that we would love to try.  Maybe next time.


        Overall, the idea is great - a central enclosed area with a full bar and
        tables and over a dozen different food stalls with everything from
        Asian, to pasta, to sandwiches and Jojo's!.  If you find yourself
        travelling the I-5 near Salem, drop by.  You will not regret it.

        I Stumbled on this place after seeing an ad for soul food on Google
        maps. What a Gold mine. OMG, So this food  establishment consists of an
        assortment of "Food Trucks" that individually provide food of different
        cultures from "Soul", "Thai", "Cajun Boil", "Grill Cheese incredibles",
        "Cheesesteak Subs", "Korean", American fish & chips, Philippine Bobas,
        Punjabi Indian, Mediterranean, just to name a few. So many, it was hard
        to pick just one, so I indulged in the company of two different heavens.
        Although I wanted So much more, with a small appetite, I settled with
        being just slightly overstuffed. Again, OMG. The trucks are stationed
        outside of an inside common seating area that offers a choice of sofa,
        love seat area, high round tables, thick rich wood picnic tables, and
        seating at a Bar that stretches out to the other end for Coffee, Tea &
        other assortment of drinks. I'm sure whatever you desire.

        My food choices were wonderful, so good, and I hope you can choose
        something of your liking based on my delightful experience. Whoever came
        up with this idea really knocked it out of the park. LoL I want to adopt
        this "Business" idea and apply it to  Metropolitan areas to encourage
        the coming together of cultures while doing something We all love,
        feeding our faces with Great food. You gotta visit if near or want to
        plan a trip just to experience a touch of goodness.

        P.S. _ I noticed a stage inside where there may be live performances on
        certain days or evenings, which only elevates the environment even more.

        A Most Favorit Place to visit per a google map's enthusiast.

        The carne asada over baked avocado was phenomenal!!

        The Tom Kha was heavy on the fish sauce, not my favorite that I’ve had.

        The gyro was good.

        The Dreaming of Sushi, the fish tasted off and the seaweed smelled like
        mold. I wouldn’t recommend it, though they were kind enough to give us a
        refund.

        Overall, love the atmosphere and food options! Would have tried the crab
        meal but it’s $40.
