        Highly recommended! I've been a customer for the past 6 years, and this
        is truly my favorite restaurant. As a Korean myself, I can confidently
        say the Korean food here is the BEST in the neighborhood! The staff are
        also extremely nice. I will surely miss this place after I graduate this
        semester.

        Went for lunch and got the bento box with bulgogi which was very good.
        The vibe is very relaxing and it’s a very easy walk from grounds.

        Kuma is a quaint little spot for Korean and Japanese food. I think it’s
        the only place in Charlottesville where you can find takoyaki and
        okonomiyaki. The takoyaki and bibimbap were great, and from previous
        trips, we found the spicy seafood udon to be truly phenomenal. The
        okonomiyaki - while impressive in the number of seafoods in it (octopus,
        squid, scallop, mussel, shrimp) - was very strange. Instead of cabbage,
        it had onions, carrots, and bean sprouts. The batter lacked seasoning
        like bonito stock and ginger, and seemed to lean instead on the toppings
        (okonomi, mayo, bonito flakes) and the seafoods. Still, it was great for
        the value, the restaurant itself is charming and unassuming, and the
        staff were very friendly and fun. Happy to try out their broader menu
        soon.

        Had the takoyaki, miso ramen bowl, and lunch “special” bento tray. The
        takoyaki was delicious, but everything else was surprisingly bland. The
        miso ramen had no flavor and both the pork and egg were way over cooked.
        I didn’t even order the tonkatsu tray, I ordered spicy pork, but I try
        not to send things back, even though this lunch special was $18. The
        gyoza had hardly any filling and was again bland, California roll was
        meh, and the edamame wasn’t even salted. Somehow even the sauce and
        wasabi tasted watered down. On top of the food, the table was filthy,
        and my wife’s water cup had dirty bits floating in it. This place was
        much better 8 years ago, I won’t be returning unfortunately.

        Pot stickers were delicious, some of the best I've had. The sushi was
        good. I prefer a higher ratio of fish to rice, but that's a personal
        preference. The miso soup was delicious. The chicken teriyaki was
        absolutely amazing, the chicken was tender and flavorful. The dessert
        was also good, their Mochi ice cream is good.
