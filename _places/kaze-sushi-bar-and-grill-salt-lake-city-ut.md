        This has to be the best sushi I have ever had in my life. The fusion of
        flavors here are prepared by master chefs who are generous in the
        portions of ingredients and present each roll as a work of art. The
        Miyazaki roll is a sight to behold. We also got the my darling roll and
        the sugarhouse roll. The rolls were so fresh and flavorful every bite
        had me wanting more. The meal ended with fried cheesecake so sinfully
        good I was shamelessly lapping it up like a dog drinking from the bowl.
        We will absolutely be back. I am so glad we found such a great spot in
        the city.

        The staff is wonderful and so was the food! Probably some of the best
        tasting appetizers I’ve had at a sushi restaurant. Highly recommend to
        try the variety of them. The atmosphere was cozy and didn’t feel crowded
        even when they were busy.

        I was about to write another review not realizing I had already wrote a
        five star review for this place. I have come here so many times I’ve
        been too many other sushi restaurants in Salt Lake specially near
        downtown and this place I would say is even better than sapa the fish is
        fresh. The service is great and the food/menu is even better. I’ve never
        had a bad experience here and I’ve probably been here about 10 to 15
        times I’m from San Diego California and so I feel like my expectations
        of sushi are high. I would absolutely recommend this place to anybody

        Kaze is my go-to sushi restaurant in SLC. It has consistently excellent
        food and good service.


        The sushi is always fresh and I appreciate the little things that they
        do to make it special.  Like forming the maki into a teardrop shape so
        that they look like a flower on the plate.  I love the udon soup and the
        tempura is light and crispy.


        I love the interior of Kaze.  The interior is classy and the lighting
        makes it feel itimate and cozy.  I also love the the pottery serving
        pieces that they have chosen.  They compliment the interior and the food
        presentation.

        Waited for fifteen minutes before anyone even greeted us. Table sat 10
        minutes after we ordered was served their rolls first. Food was average
        not great. Watch your bill though, their charging more sales tax than
        the rate for salt lake city. Should be 8.25% and last time it was higher
