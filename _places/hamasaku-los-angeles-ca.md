        If you are a sushi or sushi roll lover, this is the place to go and
        enjoy some delicious sushi or some delicious rolls. If you are in this
        area, you really cannot miss the morning menu. It has very good
        Japanese-style combos for a very good price. And if you like, in the
        afternoon you can enjoy an omakase. The prices are very affordable,
        compared to other places. This place is really better. Well, for me,
        after all, sushi is just sushi.

        Hamasaku offers solid non-traditional Sushi in Westwood.


        There are plenty of sushi restaurants in the area but Hamasaku
        definitiley offers a good balance of price and and quality. You can find
        better at a higher price and lesser at a lower price but not much at
        this mid range in this neighborhood so it makes it a great choice when
        you want something nice but not necessarily something extravagant or a
        multi hour omakase.


        The nigiri and sashimi are definitley great quality and well prepared
        (the snow trout was a personal favorite). Many dishes like the tacos,
        tostadas and soba salad are of course very non traditional but are well
        executed and offer a creative take. The sake menu is surprisingly
        expansive with more options than often seen at higher end Japanese
        restaurants so its on opportunity to sample.


        Service is fast efficient and attentive without being overbearing or
        making you feel rushed.


        Parking is available with valet out front.

        I've been dying to try this place since the pandemic. Finally.  Did it
        meet my expectations?  Mostly.


        HIDDEN. Because the restaurant is located in the downstairs corner unit,
        its somewhat hidden. But I gave 4.5 stars for the nice modern Japanese
        decor and atmosphere.


        FOOD. Dinner omakase $130. Hmm, I thought the food was really good, but
        nothing that really shouted "Wow!" But for the Westside, it's about
        right.  The pieces of fish were small, but at least the rice for the
        nigiri was still warm (nice.) But the competition for quality and value
        is tough out here in WestLA/Santa Monica.


        The omakase ended with a nice yuzu sorbet. Perfect ending.


        Sake: they sell a variety of sake by the glass or by a carafe (iced.) I
        trust they are serving me the right cold sake that I ordered. The
        serving size was smaller than I expected.

        Very nice high quality sushi place with a friendly bustling atmosphere,
        very home like yet elegant. Best dish by far was the avenue of stars
        roll. Every bite you take of that roll you can tell it’s really high
        quality. Ricky castle roll and September flower are also pretty good but
        I would say they are not worth the price. Black cod tastes really good
        and tender but is also not worth the price with the tiny quantity of
        fish you get. Yellowtail collar is cheaper but the fish texture is
        definitely worse than the black cod, with some areas of the meat being
        pretty tough. The wagyu roll is pretty good and very creative! Overall,
        a pretty creative and high quality sushi place.

        Didn’t know this is a Michelin guide restaurant and was impressed with
        the creativity and quality of the rolls! Every roll we tried was great.
        Would highly recommend Avenue of Stars if it’s on the menu. Besides the
        different types of fish inside and outside of the roll, it even has
        different toppings on each of the 8 pieces. The mushroom and the peppers
        were mediocre.

  Customer Feedback on Hamasaku$$$Folks often rave about the fresh and creative
  sushi rolls at this Westwood gem, noting how they strike a great balance of
  quality and taste without breaking the bank. Many appreciate the variety in
  the menu, including standout dishes that offer fun, non-traditional takes
  while still delivering solid flavors that keep diners coming back. Service
  tends to be efficient and attentive, creating a welcoming vibe that makes
  evenings out feel relaxed and enjoyable, even if portions might feel a bit
  modest for the price. Overall, the expansive sake options and high-quality
  ingredients earn high marks, positioning it as one of the best sushi places
  near me for a satisfying meal. While some mention that certain items could
  offer more value, the general consensus leans positive, making it a solid pick
  for anyone hunting for top-rated sushi in a casual setting.
