        Very interesting idea with moving plates. I tried a couple from this
        tape. Very professional staff, kind, responsive. The restaurant is clean
        and cozy, calm and has a huge menu. I liked everything from the
        reception of guests to the bill. I would like more seafood on the tape
        to see and want to try. Special thanks for the fact that the restaurant
        does not have any kitchen smells. And despite the fact that the kitchen
        is huge, and the cooks cook, fry constantly, there are no smells from
        the kitchen. For me, this is critically important in evaluating a
        restaurant. I definitely recommend it, I will come again.

        Sushi was fresh. Family of 5 but 1 is a baby. We ordered all you can eat
        because our girls can eat a lot sushi. We did the math and it was the
        better option then paying per roll. The girls love grabbing items off
        the belt.


        Service went above and beyond. Clean place.  And really big. Can‚Äôt wait
        to go back!


        * If you get all you can eat, I‚Äôd order the nigiri but not the rolls
        only because the rolls are so big. The rolls that you order from the
        server will come out as full size rolls and not tiny ones like on the
        belt. I wish someone would have warned us üòÜ but all good! It was a
        yummy surprise!

        Great food, service, and atmosphere serves as a foundation to any
        restaurant. Beneto‚Äôs Revolving Sushi went above and beyond for their
        customer service and exquisite culinary. Moreover, inside the
        restaurant, a sense of inspiration and diligence can be felt as servers
        such as Anjun greet your presence like a friend or family member. Above
        all, Beneto‚Äôs is a wonderful place to eat with family, friends, or if
        dining for oneself.


        Notes/Comments:

        -Thank you for making my first experience of trying sushi uniquely
        delicious and equally delectable. I had to come back a second time to
        take pictures and try the food again.


        -To anyone who may read this review, I recommend the Smoked Salmon and
        Gyoza as your first dishes. IT IS TO DIE FOR! Anjun will help you as you
        decide on what to order. Apart from her amazing personality, she will
        make sure you are always comfortable to eat.


        I will undoubtedly come back again!

        First time here. Tried the all you can eat for $38 and thought that was
        a bit pricey but wanted to try something new. Confused why the rice had
        a purple tint to it. But all the rolls we tried were good. Everything
        tasted fresh and not over cooked. Really enjoyed the ebi and baked
        lobster roll was our favorite. Wanted to order more but our waiter
        wasn't really coming to our table had us waiting to order more. Store
        was clean and not busy when we went st lunch time. Will return
