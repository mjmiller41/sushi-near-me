        I loved the atmosphere, is very busy but they call you which allows you
        to walk the strip mall, it sit in the comfort of you car. Service is
        good considering how busy they. The food is spot on! The presentation,
        the quality... They have it all. It was so delicious, we had multiple
        items and they all were delicious. Great place, you should take the time
        to visit. Oh and the cheese cake is unbelievable! I world go there just
        for that.

        Went here with my mom on a Saturday night. They weren't on a wait when
        we got there but were when we leaving. The service was good. My mom
        enjoyed her ramen. My ramen was okay. They only have three options for
        broth, two beef and one soy sauce. I can't have beef so I had to get the
        soy sauce broth which I didn't like very much despite how much I like
        soy sauce. I really wish they had a chicken broth option for the ramen
        especially since they have multiple chicken ramens. My mom and I both
        got the spicy chicken ramen.

        One of the best tasting sushi places to go around the Des Moines Area.
        Their sushi had great proportions and amazing taste that will make you
        want to come back for more. I could do without the pineapple fried rice
        and the grilled teriyaki steak. Overall a great place to eat Sushi.

The food was once again fantastic (details in the following paragraph) - and that is the main criteria when selecting a restaurant.  While communicating with our waiter was easier this time, the food delivery was quite slow to our standards - on the order of 20-30 minutes for each course after it was ordered.\n\nTonight, we started off with a Cucumber Martini (with Jalapeno) and a Salted Caramel Milk Tea (I gave up alcohol for Lent).  The Jalapeno in the Cucumber Martini was a pretty strong kick and my wife enjoyed it.  And yes, the Salted Caramel Milk Tea was quite delicious and yet was pretty light - didn't come across as thick, syrupy or overly sweet.\n\nWe started by sharing a Pork Gyozo Soup (see picture) that was very good, then decided to add on a Hana Pizza (see picture).  That Hana Pizza was definitely the highlight of my experience - a very light crust, a peanut based sauce with some fresh sushi and veggies to top it off!  My wife ordered the Combo Yaki Soba (see picture) for her meal and I opted for the Chicken Pineapple Fried Rice (see picture).  We really liked both dishes and would highly recommend them.\n\n10/12/2024\nWe have wanted to stop here several times and finally took the opportunity to do so tonight after a 4 year gap.  The exterior was modern, clean and inviting and the interior continued that vibe.  Just like the \"this place must be authentic\" feeling you get in a good Mexican restaurant (when the wait staff struggles a bit with the English language), you immediately pick up on that here...but with Japanese instead of Spanish as the core language.\n\nWe started by enjoying a Lucky Buddha beer and Raspberry Mule (see picture), followed by a delicious Ginger Salad (see picture).  My wife then opted for Spicy Chicken Ramen (see picture) for her meal and I ordered  a Spicy Scallop Roll (see picture) and Tuna Avocado Roll (see picture).  We really enjoyed all of the food!\n\nThe service was average...partially due to the wait time and partially due to the challenge of communicating with our waitress - it needed to repeat things several times in different ways to assure understanding.  The value was above average - $31/person with everything mentioned (including tax).\n\n2021\nStopped for dinner tonight and enjoyed the food.  Communication was a bit of a challenge, as it wasn't until the 3rd person coming to help before they understood the question \"what is the Seasonal Choice tap beer on the menu\", but the food quality was excellent!\n\nI started with a Hana Fuji Apple Sake (see picture) which had a strong apple flavor without being too sweet.  Next, we enjoyed an Angry Z Special Roll followed by a Spicy Crunch Crab Roll (see pictures) based on our waitress' recommendation.  Both of them were delicious and highly recommended.  Finally, we finished with the Spicy Chicken Ramen with Spicy sauce (see picture) - very good!\n\nIf you like sushi rolls or ramen, the food is definitely worth the stop.\n\nFood: 5\nAtmosphere: 4\nCharacter: 4\nService: 4\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please click on 'Like'"

        OKAY!!! Please allow me to give you real honest feed back, Because WE
        ALL KNOW IOWA DO NOT HAVE MANY FOOD CHOICES OUT HERE AND IT MAKES ME
        feel SAD, BUT LET'S GET INTO THE Atmosphere 5 STAR, Service 5 STAR, food
        1 STAR. Why?

        Okay, so my boyfriend and I moved here from North Carolina and Ramen
        that. Have had there before has had great quality, better tasting
        noodles, and more flavor, here at Hana I can NOT say the same, The
        noodles were soggy, not the best quality, but I will say I do like the
        fresh taste in it, but that's all. Now appetizers, and Martini was
        great!!!! Restaurant did look great inside. Nice lighting, floors clean,
        clean bathrooms,and most importantly TABLES WERE NICE and CLEAN 😊🥰😍
        NOW LET'S GET INTO PRESENTATION, 5 STAR 😊 AND PLENTY OF PARKING . NOW
        IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO CHECK OUT PHOTOS 😊🥰🥳🥳🥳🥳
