        My group of six visited on Saturday evening, 2/8/25, around 7-8 pm, and
        we sat together at the bar. We decided to try the all-you-can-eat sushi.
        As we began ordering, it was clear that the sushi chef was overwhelmed.
        Despite our attempts to let him know we weren't in a rush, he seemed
        irritated, both with the staff and our group.

        At one point, my girlfriend accidentally asked for a roll that was
        already on my plate. The chef responded by slamming his hand down in a
        way that startled her, making her feel as though she was in the wrong.

        We also had to ask for water four times, from two different servers,
        before we finally received it. We ordered several items but had to
        follow up multiple times before they were delivered. One of our friends
        even noticed that the group seated near us was served before he had
        received anything.

        While the food was great, the service left much to be desired. Because
        of the poor experience, I won’t be recommending this place to my friends
        or family.

        I have been coming to sushi pier for well over 10 years. Nearly on a
        weekly basis. The food is always good, the service is always great, and
        everyone is always very accommodating to my family and small toddlers.
        But, I want to give a special shout out to Ashly. Her bubbly personality
        is always a fresh breath of air. She remembers us every time we come in,
        and gets our usual things out quickly, especially for my toddlers. She’s
        amazing.  Please keep her around and make her the standard. She’s
        absolutely amazing.

        Not happy with the service and food. We had ayce sushi and it was one of
        the most unpleasant dinning experience in my life.

        - the server said they cannot make a separate check for the sake.

        - they intentionally miss orders like salmon roe, shrimp.

        - we reordered missed items but never came out.

        - they added 18% gratuity on the bill from after-tax amount as  they
        should have calculated from the before-tax amount. It’s such a small
        difference but given the service we had i really didn’t wanted to pay
        more.

        - they said they will charge 3% credit card fee which was surprising
        addition to us.

        I really want to commend Kayla (sp) for an awesome lunch service! She
        and the staff were super friendly. The establishment was  clean with
        great tunes playing during my meal. The food was very good, presentation
        was a bit lacking being some of the fish was cut improperly and falling
        apart, but overall fresh. The baked mussels are amazing! The reason for
        only 4 stars: a 3% up-charge for credit card payments is ridiculous in
        my opinion. That is the price of doing business and should not effect
        the servers, and I am sure it effects their tips.
