        I sampled the all you can eat Sushi menu and for starters its a ton of
        choices! The California roll, Shrimp tempura roll, and the Coconut
        shrimp roll All 3 were prepped well and had great flavor. The apple Sake
        went amazingly well with the food. Will recommend

        served quickly, table for 2 with a high chair. got our drink and
        appetizer order quickly. calamari was not what I was expecting. big
        seaweed salad portion. the nigiri was ok except they give WAY too much
        rice, like a whole thumb. the rolls we ordered were not that special.
        the heart one i was hopeful for but that turned out to be the most
        disappointing, the roll was falling apart and did not look like the
        picture at all. the coconut shrimp was ok and had a unique taste but
        didn’t look that appetizing and most importantly had a lot of rice and
        not a lot of fish.


        i dont think I would go back (especially at the price of $33 per
        person), but thats not to say we didnt have a nice time. i mentioned the
        christmas tree and was told it was not on the AYCE menu. the staff ended
        up just giving us one anyway which was really cool!! i actually did
        enjoy that roll. maybe we just ordered the wrong stuff?

        This is my favorite all you can eat sushi Restaurant in Northern Nevada!
        Portions are medium to large in comparison to others in the Reno area.
        Service is genuine and very nice! My drinks never run empty without
        being refilled! Please take a look at the photos I’ve posted with my
        review! Thank you to the staff for the excellent service!

        The restaurant is pretty and reasonably clean. Lots of menu options and
        a good amount of veggie rolls available. Unfortunately they don't put
        much thought into the veggie rolls - none come with cream cheese and
        they don't have delicious sauce topping them like the fish rolls do.
        This leaves the vegetarian options really dry and if you request spicy
        mayo - they provide a TINY portion and charge you for it. The worst part
        of this experience however was the service. The servers have nasty
        expressions, hardly say a word to you and just throw your menus down and
        walk away. The restaurant was DEAD for lunch hour on a Saturday and
        still the service was non existent. One woman was texting at the desk
        yet we hadn't been checked on once and sat there with empty plates. They
        then came up to us to take our plates after our first plate of all you
        can eat and was trying to end our service. We had to ask for another
        order slip which seemed to annoy her - ITS ALL YOU CAN EAT AND WE ONLY
        ORDERED ONCE lol all staff were sitting around talking, texting and
        watching TV. No wonder this place is dead located at one of the most
        popular shopping centers in all of Reno.

        Drive past here many times but haven’t heard anything about it good or
        bad. They have Ala carte and AYCE options; which we tried AYCE.


        Late dinner so it was pretty quiet only about 3 tables.

        Service and food was quick; unsure if always like this or because we
        arrived when tables were finishing up.


        They had several rolls we never heard of however one of the party
        couldn’t eat spicy so we weren’t able to try all. However the rolls we
        did try each had its own distinct taste; whereas some other AYCE taste
        all the same.
