        Cowfish at Universal Studios was incredible! I tried the buffalo chicken
        sushi and calamari, and both were absolutely delicious. The sushi was
        such a unique twist, and the buffalo chicken flavor was on point—spicy,
        tangy, and perfectly paired with the creamy sauce. The calamari was
        crispy and fresh, just the way I love it. The atmosphere was lively and
        fun, and the service was great. Definitely a must-visit spot if you’re
        at Universal! Can’t wait to come back and try more of their creative
        menu.

        This place and their awesome menu is unforgettable. The bartender was
        soooo nice and very engaging. She was so great that she somehow
        convinced me to consume all this food alone. The sandwich was so
        delicious and very creative. I ordered an appetizer, Bloody Mary
        garnished with a beef slider and a banana peanut butter chocolate shake
        for dessert. This place is a definite spot to eat while visiting
        Universal Studios, Orlando. Cheers…..

        Fun lively atmosphere. We did not need reservations (6:30pm dinner on a
        Thursday). Sat outside (because we could!). Great food combos and good
        service.


        Restrooms are up a hearty flight of stairs in back of building so don’t
        wait until last minute to go! 😉

        After two Universal trips here the past two years, I can say that it’s
        probably one of my favorite places to eat out of the parks and city
        walk.


        This is a MUST stop for all Sushi and Burger lovers. Its the best of
        both worlds. The rolls are BIG and delicious. The portions of their food
        in general are bigger and filling. The food presentation is beautiful
        and the service is always great!


        The tropical storm roll is still my favorite but I also enjoyed the
        firecracker roll, the boss roll and the spicy crunchy roll. My husband
        always gets the Texas Longhorn burger with the parmesan truffle fries.


        Sit on their patio for a quiet calm lunch or dinner. The parks are loud
        with people so it’s actually nice to have a little break during the day!
        And you can people watch from their patio which is entertaining. They
        also have heaters so even if it’s chilly it’s worth it.


        Make reservations using the universal app, there’s usually a ton of
        availability and easy change reservation times. They are located on the
        second floor so if you have littles or sore feet from walking, take the
        elevator! The restrooms are on the 3rd floor. They have a cute fish tank
        to look at the hostess stand.

        Pretty solid choice and a hidden gem out in the open, just across the
        street from Universal Store City walk on the opposing corner.


        The Crab Rangoon Dip is delicious and has real pieces of crab in the
        dip. The wanton chips are delicious and the sweet chili sauce gives it
        an extra layer of depth. Brilliant!


        The Buffalo Burgushi was pretty interesting choice and fusion food done
        right. The chicken could've been slightly less dry or maybe slow-cooked
        in buffalo sauce or something, but it wasn't enough to ruin the good.


        And the staff were stellar, even with how busy it was. Bit of a
        well-oiled machine in the chaos of being at a theme park. Well worth
        going!


        Also reservations are probably needed for tables with how busy it is,
        but the bar may be open (look for the black seats).
