        Best tasting sushi we’ve tried in the city — excellent flavor and fish
        portion. We ordered the salmon and tuna flights. I’m giving 4 stars on
        service because it took 35+ mins to receive after ordering (they were
        backed up from take out orders).

        Salmon Paradise was a 10/10. Same with the Salmon Crudo. Can you tell
        I’m a huge fan of salmon? The sushi here is so fresh and delicious. The
        only thing I would comment on is that the seating is very limited inside
        the actual restaurant. The additional seating is in the open of the 88
        marketplace mall and lots of people walking by and shopping.

        The best sushi I have had in Chicago! 312 is located in the charming 88
        Market in Chinatown. Despite being located in a grocery store, the space
        is intimate and feels like its own little world. The fish was as fresh
        as it gets, if you enjoy spicy I would recommend the Chicago Fire roll.
        Perfect for a date night or solo dining at the sushi bar.

        I’ve been wanting to try this spot for so long, so I randomly decided to
        get a late dinner and this place is actually located at the top level of
        88 marketplace in Chinatown. The menu looked so good, and the special
        set that I first tried was the aji sashimi set. The fish was of
        incredible quality, and the flavor had a more raw salty flavor, but it
        was very subtle. the yellowtail jalapeño sashimi was very buttery. Then
        I ordered some nigiri, and this was all just melting your mouth just by
        the heat of your tongue, it was unreal. my favorite nigiri was the uni,
        this was top 3 for sure.the wagyu was delicate on the salt and was also
        a repeat for me. The botany ebb was mild sweet and loved the crunchy
        heads too. then ordered even more nigiri, and really loved the lean tuna
        here, it was fleshy and soft. The hand rolls were a must order too like
        the spicy tuna which had a hefy amount of tuna, and the the yellow tail
        handroll was light and packed to the top. for dessert, the finishing
        touch was the wagyu topped with caviar and this was also a really solid
        dollop of caviar. Overall, a top five sushi spot in chicago, very
        impressed.
