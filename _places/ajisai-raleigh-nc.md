        I love this spot! Best sushi I ever had in my whole life. I'm 40. I love
        sushi. This place nails it in every way. The quality of the sushi,
        excellent. The atmosphere is cute, hip, modern, peaceful, fun...all at
        the same time. The prices are fair for the quality and experience. They
        had my favorite plum wine that wasn't on the menu. The presentation,
        perfect. The staff, professional and I would even say that they seem
        more classically trained in fine dining etiquette type service than your
        basic casual restaurant staff generally. Very nice. The waiter we had
        let us know he would come back to take our order once we closed the menu
        so there would be no pressure.

        It wasn't too busy but it wasn't empty. On a Sunday evening at dinner
        time. I was really pleased with the big selection. I was impressed with
        everything about it. We will be back, several times a year. This is my
        new spot and recommendation place for the best sushi ever.

        I love this spot! Best sushi I ever had in my whole life. I'm 40. I love
        sushi. This place nails it in every way. The quality of the sushi,
        excellent. The atmosphere is cute, hip, modern, peaceful, fun...all at
        the same time. The prices are fair for the quality and experience. They
        had my favorite plum wine that wasn't on the menu. The presentation,
        perfect. The staff, professional and I would even say that they seem
        more classically trained in fine dining etiquette type service than your
        basic casual restaurant staff generally. Very nice. The waiter we had
        let us know he would come back to take our order once we closed the menu
        so there would be no pressure.

        It wasn't too busy but it wasn't empty. On a Sunday evening at dinner
        time. I was really pleased with the big selection. I was impressed with
        everything about it. We will be back, several times a year. This is my
        new spot and recommendation place for the best sushi ever.

        Came in on a snowy night and it was fantastic.  Felt awful I have worked
        in the shopping center for over a year and had not tried it. Partner
        loved the Pad Thai, said they would need a box when it arrived and ended
        up polishing it off.  The Garlic White Fish was light, full of flavor,
        and had lovely texture balance.  The tuna "wontons" were amazingly
        creative.  The quality on everything was top notch and Kate was
        delightful.

        Mix feelings about this place, I must admit is the restaurant I have
        visited the most in Tampa in a whooping 16 times in 2 months.


        Food is always fresh, well presented and the kitchen moves fast!


        Although my latest experiences lacked service, professionalism and
        cleanliness.


        Servers out of control, messing up the orders, bringing things out of
        order meaning appetizers at the end!


        We need it refills and never got them. Our plates accumulated and when
        we asked the server to removed them she stated she wasn’t being paid to
        do that…


        Terrible last experience will potentially prevent me from visiting in a
        long time, that if I even return!


        Pictures from the last 3 visits. Consistency in food was great and last
        3 pictures will show how the was being left and I will conserve the rest
        as I find them distasteful.

        A wonderful experience and would have been a full five star, but it was
        my food choice that made it 4 star. Tempura shrimp had way too much
        breading. Fantastic service and atmosphere. I will definitely come back
        and try another dish.

        The garlic white tuna and the pink lady were the star of the show
        today!  The white tuna had a crust that was flavorful and packed a kick
        at the end. The pink lady specialty roll was a different experience in
        black rice, tuna, and avocado. I wish we had tried more specialty rolls
        because the Godzilla and Volcano really caught my eye. We ended up with
        the bento lunches with shrimp tempura and 3 regular rolls as a bigger
        bang for our buck. Those were pretty standard and maintained the
        expected quality. I can't wait to go back for the scallop app and more
        specialty rolls. Parking was absolutely atrocious but it seemed par for
        the course in this area.
