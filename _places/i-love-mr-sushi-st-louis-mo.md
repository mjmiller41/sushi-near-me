        The man running the restaurant was very rude on the phone and when I
        came in to pick up and I also ended up with a very upset stomach. I
        would definitely not eat the tuna from here or probably anything at all.
        Even the miso soup was watery and had very little seaweed or tofu.

        would definitely not eat the tuna from here or probably anything at all.
        Even the miso soup was watery and had very little seaweed or tofu.

        I have eaten at this Sushi restaurant for years off and on.  Today I had
        a hankering for Sushi and I said to myself, "Let's see if I LOVE
        Mr.Sushi is still good."  And guess what, it was!!!

        I got a rainbow roll and it has crab,  salmon, shrimp and snapperwith
        cucumber and avocado.  I ALWAYS order lots of Wasabi and Ginger.  I
        actually ordered online, and they gave me exactly what I requested, and
        it was fresh and so delicious!  If you haven't been there, please don't
        miss out on this delicious sushi.  They have so much variety also.  It
        was so very fresh and good.  They also still have friendly, fast
        service.

        This was a last minute choice while a friend and I were in the area.
        Such a phenomenal find! The service was great! The serve we had was very
        kind and patient. She brought our appetizer quickly and the food came
        just as quick.


        The sushi rolls are HUGE! I mean for the price we paid it was a really
        great find. I’ve been to several sushi spots and I know what we got
        would have costed a whole lot more.


        I highly recommend this place for Sushi. You won’t be disappointed.

        We stopped in while waiting for a jewelry repair being done nearby.
        Although this place isn’t much from the outside, it is clean and has a
        great setup inside.

        We ordered a few rolls, salads, and soup. Service was quick! We had
        everything on our table within 12 min!

        The rolls were absolutely delicious!

        ** Side note, some very demanding women came in while we were eating and
        gave the waiter a pretty hard time. Despite these women and their
        aggressive nature, this particular waiter and the rest of the staff was
        very patient and kind. I can’t say I would’ve held it together the way
        the staff did. I was thoroughly impressed with the way they handled
        themselves.

        Having lived nearby for over 10 years, this was my go-to place for
        delicious sushi for a fair price and I still come to eat here when I
        visit. It's a nice, quiet location. Clean. Friendly staff and prompt
        service. We tried a variety of rolls and the top 3 rolls that received a
        deep nod of approval were the Mexican roll, Red Dragon, and the
        Caterpillar. If you're a drinker, highly recommend the Haiku Premium
        sake. It has a very, very subtle grape flavor and goes down like water.
