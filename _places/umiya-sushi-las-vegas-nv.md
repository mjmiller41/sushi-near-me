        The late night all u can eat Ayce sushi $21.95 at Umiya is legit!!


        We came around 10pm and 80% of seats were full which was a good sign. We
        were quickly greeted and seated. What we ordered were as follows.

        Miso soup

        Tempura noodle

        Spicy Scallop roll

        Smoked salmon

        Seafood Dynamite

        Salmon belly

        Yum yum crab

        Tina poke

        Baked oyster

        Chicken katsu

        Pork belly (this one is average)

        Bugulgi fries

        Snow white roll

        Flamingo roll

        Kiss of fire

        Firecracker


        Service is great and dishes were served quickly. (Sometimes they were
        busy so you have to let them know you are ready to order.)


        At night, the restaurant is a little bit dark  so I have to look at the
        menu very closely.


        You can get a free Thai tea (valued $5) after you leave a review on
        Yelp. I don’t leave whatever reviews for just a complimentary drink so I
        waited until my husband and I finished all orders. I wrote this review
        and gave 5 stars since I really enjoyed it.


        There is a 60 min limitation so I will recommend to come earlier as you
        can. Overall, we enjoyed Umiya and will definitely come back.

        I come here all the time but never left a review this time, it’s only
        right to show my appreciation for their excellent service and fantastic
        food! We ordered and enjoyed ebi sushi (probably 30 pieces, maybe more!)
        and tried different rolls, fish, squid, and oysters. Everything was
        fresh, delicious, and perfectly prepared. The quality of the food and
        the attentive service make this place a standout. I will definitely
        recommend Umiya Japanese Restaurant to anyone who loves amazing Japanese
        cuisine. Can’t wait to return!

        Decent sushi Restaurant

        We reserved a table for 5 before we came to eat.  It was about an hour
        wait @ about 9 pm on a weekday.  Luckily the restaurant opened until
        midnight.

        It was all you can eat sushi @ about $35/person. A good deal of you can
        eat a lot. Everything we ordered was priced total at about the price we
        paid for.

        The portions were small but we were well fed and full.  The group of 3
        teenagers and 2 adults, so we ordered about 3 rounds of food.

        Overall the food was fresh but the quality was just average.

        I would take my family back again for the all you can eat sushi.

        Today, I had the opportunity to visit Umiya Sushi.  The service staff
        was not only kind, they were efficient and attentive.  The restaurant
        was cozy and had a hip vibe.  The shusi was fabulous and tasty, cold
        when it needed to be, hot and steamy when it needed to be.  The soup was
        a hit.  The price description was apparent, so there was no deception or
        price increase.  For AYCE, the price was worth it.  What a delightful
        lunch right of the strip.

        Arriving later so we looked for a late night dinner.  And came across
        this ayce late night menu. $21.95 sounded too good but we tried it
        anyways.


        Pleasantly surprised and we would bring the kids with us next time. 
        There is something for everyone, even our picky 18 year old.


        You can make reservations on open table. Time limit is 60 minutes but we
        didn’t have any issues.  Anyone with a tablet can make an order for you.


        Next time we will try to noodles- they have udon and ramen.


        Nigiri’s just have a little ball of rice which is nice.  The larger
        rolls have more rice and make you fuller but you can ask for a half
        roll.


        I wanted to try their Thai tea with coffee jelly, we arrived at 1030 and
        they didn’t have anymore.
