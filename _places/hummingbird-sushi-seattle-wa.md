        Tried it for the first time on Saturday. I didn't know what to expect as
        this place is relatively new and no Seattle Times or other newspaper
        exposure. I thought it would the traditional style Nigiri. Yes it is but
        doing the 10 course Omakase a number of dishes were fusion in style and
        was amazing. I've done all the top Omakase's in town and this rivals all
        of those putting it in the top 3. But I would give it the #1 in town due
        to it's fusion creativity, style and affordable price. I definitely will
        be back. Parking is tough but totally worth it if you're looking for one
        of the most creative and best sushi in town.

        This was the best sushi I have ever had. The salmon mushroom soy plate
        was the best texture that has ever graced my mouth. I had a negi toro
        hand roll as well, and until I tried the yuzu scallops I had began to
        think I could never have something that perfect again. The atmosphere in
        there was amazing as well, the service was incredible and everyone was
        incredibly nice.


        I am a tourist here, and I leave tomorrow, but I will be making it back
        to Seattle at some point in my life if for no other reason than to eat
        at this restaurant.


        Please eat here. If you enjoy food in any capacity, you will remember
        this place for life. This is not an exaggeration.

        Went here for the 10+ Omakase. Definitely the most creative Omakase I
        have had in Seattle. Unlike most omakases in Seattle, this one consists
        of both nigiri pieces AND small tasting plates. The dishes all primarily
        utilized traditional flavors and ingredients, while blending them
        seamlessly with a variety of flavors that both suprised and
        nostalgically treated the palette. While cutting and shaping nigiri is
        undoubtedly an art, Chefs Ji and Filipe got to show off their talents
        outside of purely knife work with each dish. My personal favorites were
        the scallops in yuzu sea foam on a Himalayan salt block, and grilled
        octopus with corn puree with a tortilla chip. Both of these dishes
        maintained a typical Japanese flavor profile, but played with texture
        and additional floral flavors just enough to give it a much more pop
        than usual. Chefs Ji and Filipe were entertaining to talk to, as well as
        extremely knowledgeable about the dishes they were creating. Ask them
        about their origins, it explains the influence behind the dishes, and
        makes them even more meaningful.

        My boyfriend surprised me with the 10+ course omakase for an early
        Valentines dinner and I was so excited since it was our first time! Chef
        Ji and his wife were so welcoming, knowledgeable and sweet as well as
        Felipe. The dishes were so creative, delicious, and filling. The fish
        was so fresh and I’m not lying when I say there wasn’t one plate I
        didn’t like! I’m so honored and grateful so be a part of this wonderful
        experience. I hope to come back again!


        ** Side note: we sat at the sushi bar and it was not busy(which is rare)
        so I do feel like it added more positive light to our time since we had
        a lot of attention/got to enjoy every plate while talking to the chef.

        My husband and I did the 10 course omakase for his birthday and had such
        a lovely time! Every course was absolutely delicious, which was
        complimented beautifully by incredible staff. The owner is the chef and
        his wife is the hostess and they make such a cute dynamic duo that was
        really endearing to spend time with. We wholly recommend this
        experience!
