        Really cute casual spot with an interesting combination. Love the menu
        offerings. Our server was super nice. The food was pretty good. The only
        thing not to our liking were the milkshakes. The cookies and cream
        tasted like cream and when we ordered the chocolate shake it also tasted
        like cream- no chocolate. The birthday cake was also super delicious.
        We'll definitely return 🙌🏻

        Pleasantly surprised by how great my experience was! The food is
        delicious, the burger was flavorful and juicy, and the sushi was fresh
        and flavorful!


        I love the atmosphere too! It's a fun, unique blend of westerns and
        eastern, with a giant aquarium in the middle and a comical movie motif.
        So quirky and well done!


        The Bento Box seems to be the best deal because you can sample a bit of
        everything!


        Very clean! Handicap accessible. Parking is difficult, but free.

        The restaurant was very crowded and extremely noisy. There was music
        banging in the background which made conversation almost impossible to
        hear. The decorations were fun and colorful. We were able to park at a
        nearby parking deck for free. The food quality was 4/5. We did not like
        the salad or blue cheese dressing. The truffle fries were overrated. The
        burgers are delicious. Excellent service. Cost $84/2. It’s a very trendy
        spot.

        Nice lunch, with good atmosphere. Service was terrific, food was very
        good and seating comfortable.We sat in the enclosed patio in the corner
        on a nice Saturday afternoon. After a 5 minute wait for an outdoor
        table,we had the menu explained to us. The menu, can be a little
        confusing, because (I think) they want to give you many options. Which
        is good, but can make things confusing. In my experience, there are few
        places that offer, red meat with a fish choice. The side offering are
        generous potions. A great combo if you want some red meat, but also a
        filling healthy meal. I had to ask for more ginger, no biggy. The place
        was a little noisy, but  worth the price.

        Beware, the entrance is the revolving door  on the left.

        I was very excited for my first time at Cowfish, since sushi and burgers
        are two of my favorite foods. Given the hype around the place, I went
        there with the expectation of a great burger and great sushi. I’d say
        that’s mostly what I got.


        The Bison Burger was delicious, albeit very messy. The Spicy Tuna Roll
        was good, but nothing special. My partner and I were both surprised that
        our appetizer and drinks were definitely the highlight of the meal!


        While we enjoyed our dinner at Cowfish, I wish I had tempered my
        expectations a bit. It was very expensive for what we got, but mostly
        good. I’d also recommend putting your name in online before leaving the
        house, as the off-waitlist wait was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.


        Overall a good experience, but I can’t say the food merits the price or
        the long wait times. Still worth a try and I will likely be back!
