        loveeeee this sushiiiiii - I came because it’s a notable place in the
        area and I wanted to try it. One of my first times learning about and
        trying toro. Very cool. I don’t necessarily love toro, but the staff was
        very friendly and happy to be making sushiiiiiii and it was cool to
        learn more about it from the experts.

        We came to dine while there was an SF Restaurant week. Everything we had
        was excellent and amazing.

        BUT, the disappointing thing was we had to enjoy SAKE in a wine glass.

        Sushi Ran offers a cozy and intimate dining experience, perfect for a
        romantic dinner or a quiet meal with friends. They also have an outdoor
        seating area.


        While the service was friendly, the pacing between courses was quite
        slow, which detracted slightly from the overall experience.


        We dined at Sushi Ran during SF Restaurant Week. The seaweed salad,
        while fresh, was a bit too crunchy for my preference.


        However, the Surf and Turf was a standout. The wagyu steak was cooked to
        perfection, juicy and tender, and the red miso sauce complemented it
        beautifully. The miso-glazed black cod was also a highlight. The fish
        was cooked to a flaky perfection, and the glaze added a rich, savory
        flavor.


        The toffee cake with spiced caramel and ginger gelato was a delightful
        conclusion to the meal. The warm cake paired perfectly with the cold,
        creamy gelato, creating a delightful contrast of textures and flavors.


        We also sampled the tempura oysters, which were crispy and light, with a
        perfectly cooked oyster inside.


        Their nigiri was also fresh and each nigiri included a thick cut of the
        fish. Also, $15 for some fresh Hokkaido uni was a pretty good deal
        (usually restaurants charge MP for uni but Sushi Ran had a fixed price).


        Overall, Sushi Ran is a solid choice. While the service could be
        improved, the quality of the food was good.
