        I love coming here for their sushi. Fish are always fresh with
        reasonable pricing. My favorite of all times here are their spicy rolls.
        I'm very particular about my spicy rolls; there are not that many places
        that know how to make these traditional rolls right. My order for spicy
        tuna roll, spicy salmon roll, and spicy yellow tail roll were on the
        point and tasted amazing!

        From the moment I walked in the door, I was well greeted.  The Rainbow
        Roll was the best I have ever has, since I left California.

        The Tuna, and Salmon were so fresh they melted in my mouth.


        Highly Recommended.


        Happy Geek


        I truly enjoyed my visit to day 02/18/2025

        Small sushi shop located shortly after you make it into Alpharetta from
        Peachtree Corners. Very unassuming spot in the corner that I didn't
        expect.


        The place is really small inside but really the perfect size for a nice
        sushi place. However, the time I went made it feel like one group could
        easily ruin this place.


        Despite that, the workers did a great job dealing with a really unruly
        group. Despite them taking longer than normal, they did a great job
        getting stuff out and tending to everyone in the restaurant, which was
        me and the unruly group.


        Now, the food itself was really good, and I love the diverse platting of
        the dishes. Definitely be prepared to spend some money if you like great
        sushi cuz they have some great variety, but they have affordable rolls,
        too so it's good either way.


        They're definitely worth going to again. Give them a try. They're great!

        NOTE: My previous review was for Sushi Uchi. I don't know if it has new
        owners, but we haven't tried "The Spot" yet. We will soon and I'll
        update my review. Below is my OLD review.


        We LOVED Sushi Uchi. Most of the time we did pickup, but eating at the
        restaurant was the best. It's small, but the tables are well spaced. The
        employees were always so nice and often recognized us. The fish tasted
        fresh. They had a good selection sake, including premium and unfiltered
        varieties. My favorite thing in the whole menu was the Yellowtail
        Heaven.

        We were craving sushi and wanted to go to a place outside of our
        Gwinnett, BuHi or downtown areas. Great reviews brought us here and we
        were not disappointed. The place we packed and we luckily didn’t have to
        wait too long. Service was good even thought a single waitress pretty
        much took care of the entire restaurant. Kudos on her great service.
        Food was great and we will definitely be back.
