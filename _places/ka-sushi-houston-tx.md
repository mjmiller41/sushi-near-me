        KA Sushi’s happy hour is outstanding! We enjoyed the beautiful weather
        on their charming patio, which set the perfect vibe. The oysters, both
        raw and broiled, were phenomenal, bursting with fresh, bold flavors. The
        Old Fashioned was spot on—perfectly balanced and expertly crafted. Happy
        hour deals are fantastic, with generous portions and great prices on
        cocktails and sushi. The staff was friendly and attentive, making it an
        ideal spot for a fun evening. Highly recommend and can’t wait to return!

        I have been to myriad sushi restaurants through the decades, and by far
        this restaurant produces the best meals I am lucky to enjoy!  They don't
        serve 'ordinary' sushi meals; no, the flavors and creations are
        next-level. You'll get very tasty food, presented beautifully.


        The staff was as wonderful as was the food.  We were immediately greeted
        and made to feel special.  The food came quickly and our server made
        sure we were well attended to.


        The restaurant is clean and neat, an indication that the kitchen is also
        clean.


        One of the best!

        Good place for a quick drink and bite. The eggplant is delicious.
        Tempura veggies were good, not amazing. Didn’t have a cocktail, was told
        they were good, and had super clear big balls of ice. The mocktails
        weren’t super. Would maybe go here again.

        Edit 2/14 - 2 stars: I finally came here for dinner and it was bad. The
        service took forever - I had to ask 3 times for a waiter to take my
        order - it took 20min. The food prep took another 25min. The team was
        putting dirty dishes right around where I was seated at the counter, so
        I felt like sitting in the kitchen. The sushi quality was just ok too…
        Not worth the price tag.


        Really liked this spot. Neat and spacious inside. Very friendly staff -
        especially Michael at the bar!

        Can highly recommend to try their happy hour (everyday until 6:30pm)

        We came in on a tuesday night, it was quiet. we sat outside and had
        Danny as our server, he was great! and the manager also stopped by to
        make sure we were being taken care of.


        I had the espresso martini- it is made with tequila which i’m not
        entirely sure i’m a fan of. My cousin loved her sake.


        1.rockefeller oysters 9/10 would get again

        2nd roll- 2/10 do not like fried rolls- not the restaurants fault at all
        tho.

        3. wagyu slim- 7.5/10 i liked it but i needed a lil extra something

        4.chimi roll - 8/10. interesting flavors, pretty good.
