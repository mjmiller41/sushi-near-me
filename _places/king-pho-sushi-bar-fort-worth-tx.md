        The place was spectacular! Portion sizes were big considering the price,
        the pho was amazing. We ordered boba and sushi; neither of them
        disappointed us. We were very happy with our meal and speedy service. We
        will be coming back soon!

        Nice place with good food and service. The atmosphere is really good and
        well maintained. The flavour of the food can be noticed easily and we
        enjoyed it.

        Must try: pho, chicken fried rice and noodles

        My wife and I decided to enjoy some pho and decided on 'King Pho.' The
        food ranged from "great" to "okay." The beef pho was wonderful but the
        chicken pho had dry, gamey pieces of meat in it. The beef banh mi was a
        treat. Price wise $17 for a "king" size pho seemed excessive considering
        a regular didn't look any smaller and was less expensive. The Bahn mi
        was appropriately priced at $7. Overall I would return for the food.

        The service left a little to be desired for. We were immediately seated,
        which was great, but we waited almost 10 minutes without anyone asking
        what we wanted to drink before a waiter came up and asked if we were
        ready to order. Based on service alone, I would go somewhere else first.

        Will definitely be back. Everything we ate was great. The beef spring
        roll was so tasty. My husband said his spicy tuna was great. They
        weren't on the large side as most I've seen. The flat noodles were so
        good.

        Coming from NYC I have high standards for sushi.  While not the very
        best sushi I have had in the Ft Worth area it was excellent at a
        reasonable price.  Value to cost ratio very high.  Sushi prepared very
        well with timely and friendly service, I enjoyed it very much. 
        Definitely worth a try.  It was slow when I was there so I was able to
        chat with the server who was very friendly and attentive.

        Atmosphere was inviting, although the exterior was kind of nondescript. 
        Plenty of seats at the sushi bar.  Many tables available, I can see how
        when they are busy service might be strained as others have complained
        about.  My experience was excellent and I will be returning
