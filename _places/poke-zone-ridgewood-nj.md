        Nice casual poke place for lunch in Ridgewood.

        The spicy tonkatsu ramen was pretty good (good noodles and toppings, the
        broth is thin but tasty). The poke bowl was fine too (just a minor thing
        it was too saturated in sauce).

        Nice casual poke place for lunch in Ridgewood.

        The spicy tonkatsu ramen was pretty good (good noodles and toppings, the
        broth is thin but tasty). The poke bowl was fine too (just a minor thing
        it was too saturated in sauce).

        We ordered poke bowls from here. Everything is flavorless and bland. My
        friend enjoyed hers , however mine was really a mess and not in a good
        way. The rice was sticky and had zero flavor, the zucchini noodles were
        crispy but completely bland. The fish itself, I got three proteins,
        salmon, spicy tuna, spicy salmon. The fresh salmon was okay, very
        average. The spicy salmon and spicy tuna had good textures but again…
        flavorless. Overall, would not recommend, would not order again.

        Its different then what you are used to at a poke spot. They sushi was
        fresh tasted great. Its table service so as you build it the waiter puts
        it all together for you. One think I wasnt used to was how they prepped
        the sushi in your bowl. Its was like minced which I kinda liked. You
        were able to get more bites with your other toppings. The rock shrimp
        appetizer was lights out and the serve bubble tea.  Better then that
        stuff they serve in the mall. I will be back and bringing some more
        friends. If you aren't a sushi fan you can put shrimp or chicken in your
        bowl which made my wife happy.  If you are a poke fanatic you will be
        happy and if you want a roll the fantastic roll was outstanding.

        I seldom write reviews however, I feel the need to warn everybody that
        feels the need to try this place to please stay away! My pregnant wife
        and I just tried Poke Zone for the first time and got extremely sick.
        After eating our bowl about halfway we found Mold on what appears to be
        a fried onion, I stopped looking for the mold after that and threw the
        bowl away. Not sure if the mold made us sick or if the type of fish we
        chose was bad. Please go somewhere else and do not take the risk. Please
        see attached photo.
