        I liked the Corn Korokke as an alternative vegetarian appetizer. It was
        a good texture, flavor was a little plain, but it paired well with some
        of the spicier and more flavorful fare.


        Tom Kha soup was the right balance of sweet and spicy for me. Not a huge
        fan of the cherry tomatoes in the soup but they were very fresh.


        Basil Fried Rice was excellent. Great spice level, the jalapeno was a
        great addition to this dish.


        Decor is unassuming but cozy. I thought the candles and plants were a
        thoughtful addition that added to the vibe.


        Server was very welcoming and pleasant.

        I liked the Corn Korokke as an alternative vegetarian appetizer. It was
        a good texture, flavor was a little plain, but it paired well with some
        of the spicier and more flavorful fare.


        Tom Kha soup was the right balance of sweet and spicy for me. Not a huge
        fan of the cherry tomatoes in the soup but they were very fresh.


        Basil Fried Rice was excellent. Great spice level, the jalapeno was a
        great addition to this dish.


        Decor is unassuming but cozy. I thought the candles and plants were a
        thoughtful addition that added to the vibe.


        Server was very welcoming and pleasant.

        Service is so so nice! We really enjoyed the cashew chicken. The green
        curry has a spicy kick to it, but I personally didn’t enjoy the texture
        of the vegetables. The sushi was also great!

        A great find for both Sushi and Thai food! I visited this place for the
        first time with friends and absolutely loved it. The ambience is
        beautiful, with plenty of plants creating a calm and relaxing
        atmosphere. The staff was welcoming and attentive. There lots of variety
        options on the menu, all at an affordable price with good portion sizes.
        We tried the cucumber salad and Philadelphia in apprtizers, volcano and
        sunrise sushis in addition to Kee Mao, all of which were delicious!
        Definitely a spot worth revisiting if you're craving a mix of fresh
        sushi and flavorful Thai dishes.

        Absolutely wonderful meal. The sushi was everything and more that I was
        craving. Crab Rangoon was also 10/10.


        Service was extremely fast. Will definitely be coming back.

        I have been here multiple times, as well as ordered through delivery
        apps. I am not sure why I have not reviewed this place sooner because I
        LOVE IT. I'm obsessed with their Veggies Crunch sushi, Thai Tea, and
        enjoy their Corn Korokke, Veggie Rolls, Tempura Apps, and Miso Soup as
        appetizers. I've brought others who have had Garlic Chicken, Chicken
        Katsu, Ramen and other sushi options and they all loved it. Totally
        recommend this place. There is a woman who serves us who is always very
        kind and attentive and I hope I learn her name eventually because she
        makes the experience better as well!
