        To begin, the soup was excellent. Eel and crab sushi arrived with
        dumplings commencing what quickly became a feast of fried rice,
        vegetables, chicken, and even a few pieces of octopus. My dining
        companion and I were famished and everything tasted good, especially the
        sushi and cucumbers. The service was kind and the experience was
        enjoyable overall. Not too crowded but not empty.


        The music was too loud and was rather obnoxious, as it did not seem to
        belong in this kind of venue. They would do better to establish a mood
        with some traditional asiatic music or something less blaring and
        intrusive.


        I'd return to this location, although I can't say I was highly
        impressed, nor disappointed. It presents an option for the area. The
        food is standard in numerous ways but it is also done with care and had
        excellent taste. It was not so good that I would necessarily order the
        same thing again, but good enough to return and try other options.


        Upon returning the impression seemed to dwindle a bit. The food is worth
        a try but I'm not sure how often I'd return.

        Did you know that the word Teppanyaki in Japanese means ‘splash hot oil
        in customer’s eye?


        Although Got Sushi tossed out its much beloved teppanyaki tables (and
        chefs) ages ago, the cuisine and customer service still SIZZLE!


        So after hittin’ the ballot box and pounding down two Whopper Junior
        appetizers at BK, I was ready for a REAL meal. And I found it at Got
        Sushi!


        The tall bottle of Kirin (not Japanese?) and Lemon Chicken Bento box
        instantly made life worth living again.

        This place has been around for a long time. Sushi here is really good.
        Unfortunately, other alternate options like the chinese food are alright
        but expensive. Mind as well spend more money on the 🍣.


        This place can honestly use some renovations. There are a lot of people
        order takeout here rather than coming in. It's probably best to enjoy
        their sushi fresh from the bar and talk to very friendly people at the
        sushi bar. They're also very fast. I think they changed the owner a few
        years back, and that explains the poor customer service. It's a shame
        because this place was alive and filled with people when I visited in
        the past. Now it's kind of a ghost town and a place to order takeout.
        The alcohol bar is covered in takeout plastic bags and containers. One
        of the table near the bar is a financial office for this old lady doing
        paperwork while people are awkwardly eating in the same room lol.

        Really great service fast and friendly! Miso soup came complimentary.
        The edamame was fresh and steamed perfectly. The sushi chef helped me
        pick out which rolls I would like best! Loved all 7 of them! Had my
        birthday dinner here and came out with green tea icecream! So happy and
        wonderful! My new favorite place for sushi and for a birthday dinner.
