        AMAZING little sushi spot. The spicy crab roll was awesome, and the
        atmosphere was warm and cozy. A nice little break from the noise. The
        waiter was attentive, and the sushi came out very timely. Will
        ABSOLUTELY be back! I can't wait to try more.

        The service was excellent. I love the mood that was casted. And the food
        did taste decent. The main problem was 2 things, it came out really
        fast, and after finishing the meal, my fiance felt sick. She went to the
        bathroom first, but then we just left after paying to quickly take care
        of things. Though I felt mildly ill too, it didn't affect me as bad as
        her. I love what I received from this place, I have nothing bad to
        really say about anyone, but I'll probably not be returning back.

        Best Sushi in Peoria! I have had sushi in Phoenix and Chicago, and this
        is as good as you can get there. My family shared Mango Rolls, Fried
        California Rolls, Shrimp Tempura Rolls and Tuna Cream Cheese Roll, all
        top quality seafood and tuna. And the ambience has a classic Japanese
        vibe, clean and well-maintained. The service is top-notch, fast,
        friendly and cordial, with drinks refilled in a timely manner. Overall,
        exceeded expectations!

        The food was delicious. I ordered takoyaki so my man can try it for the
        first time. It was phenomenal. The sushi was amazing. The miso soup was
        very good and so comforting. The staff was kind and friendly. When I go
        shopping in this center, I will always want to stop here.

        My fiance and I decided to have a dinner date here after finishing our
        Christmas shopping today. It was AMAZING. The staff was super friendly,
        the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was great. I had the fried
        Maki roll, some miso soup, and fried calamari. 10/10 recommend all of
        those as they were fantastic. HOWEVER, I'm taking 1 mental star away
        because after reading the reviews I was SUPER STOKED to have some usher
        club music playing while I ate my food and I, unfortunately, did not get
        to hear a singular club song. Only beautiful instrumentals that made me
        feel like the main character in a movie.


        We will be returning though :)
