        Got take out. Food well packaged. The sushi was actually pretty good.
        Decent portion as well. But the teriyaki chicken was just doing the bare
        minimum. They did not even cook the onions….

        Lunch for two on a Friday for $30 is a good deal.

        The shrimp tempura had minimal meat and lots of breading.
        The salad bar has lettuce with raw fish which I enjoyed.

        M Sushi offers a mixed dining experience that balances great food with a
        few notable drawbacks. The staff are excellent—friendly, attentive, and
        knowledgeable, contributing positively to the overall atmosphere.
        However, the ambiance leaves much to be desired, as the place looks and
        smells old, which detracts from the dining experience.


        The sushi here is a highlight; fresh and expertly prepared, it's a
        delight for sushi lovers. The Teriyaki Steak is also commendable, cooked
        to perfection with a nice balance of flavors. On the other hand, the
        Hibachi Steak falls short, being excessively salty. The gyoza, while
        decent, lacked the distinctive flavor of sesame oil, which would have
        elevated the dish.


        The sashimi offerings are a mixed bag: the Tuna Sashimi needs
        improvement as it often arrives still partially frozen, while the Salmon
        Sashimi hits the mark with its freshness and ideal texture.


        One significant issue we encountered was during billing. We went there
        for lunch but were charged the dinner rate of $21.99 instead of the
        lunch rate of $14.99, which was quite disappointing.


        Overall, M Sushi's strengths lie in its sushi and customer service, but
        it could benefit from some updates and adjustments to enhance the dining
        experience fully, including ensuring accurate billing and refining some
        menu items.

        Ate here about a month ago and from the jump the service was pretty bad.
        We were seated by a guy who said he doesn’t actually work there but was
        friends with one of the servers. Even worse was our actual server, who
        barely said a word to us the entire time. Didn’t even greet us


        For the price, and considering it’s all you can eat, the sushi was a lot
        better than I expected it to be. Also the tempura shrimp appetizer was
        hitting


        I hate leaving negative reviews because I want to see restaurants
        succeed but they really need to tighten up their service discipline if
        they want people to keep eating here

        Good isn't bad but the service and atmosphere makes you afraid to eat
        the food.  Our server barely spoke to us.  Asked us if we were DONE as
        we both put the only order of sushi we had gotten....I think "would you
        like to order anything else" is more appropriate.  Felt unwelcomed and
        customers are what keep businesses afloat....be courteous as we were to
        you.


        Lastly PLEASE update and clean this place up....it's literally half
        daycare or something with toys, crayons and personal items taking up
        half the restaurant and when you are eating there is a septic
        smell.....don't plan on returning but the food wasn't bad.....gas
        station sushi at a landfill anyone?
