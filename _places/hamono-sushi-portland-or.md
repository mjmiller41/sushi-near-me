        Had an amazing dining experience at Hamono sushi! Every dish was
        incredibly fresh and full of flavor. The presentation was beautiful, and
        you can really taste the quality in every bite. The service was
        attentive and made the meal even more enjoyable. If you’re looking for a
        delicious and authentic omakase experience, this place is a must-try!
        I’ll definitely be coming back for more.

        Everything was delicious, especially the sashimi. The staff were
        personable and attentive. The atmosphere was small and cozy. It was a
        great, complete experience. I can't wait to come back again to try their
        omakase.

        Absolutely fantastic sushi, maybe the best or tied for the best I have
        had in Portland.  The quality of the fish was great and the AYCE menu
        had some banger fish that was so fun to revisit.  Their tempura was also
        excellent, with a super nice cronch and lovely taste on the insides.  
        The interior was really cool and smaller than I thought it would be, but
        very cozy.  The server Nate was incredibly knowledgeable and willing to
        talk through anything being served.


        Would go back for the Spanish tuna belly toro alone, but everything was
        so good I will be going back for it all!!!

        Had the pleasure to experience the unlimited omakase during my visit to
        Portland. Our host was very knowledgeable about each dish and also
        recommended which sake to choose to accompany our dishes (where one of
        them was specifically chosen out of menu). He is also very generous on
        the portions and pampered us until the end. I can go over each dish and
        say how well each of them are but I think it’s an experience you have to
        experience yourself. Would definitely visit every time I drop by
        Portland.

        Took my buddy here for his birthday and we had a blast. Our server was
        extremely knowledgeable and ran the floor like a boss. We chose the
        omakase option and it was amazing. The kitchen kept up with the orders
        and the flow. 10/10
