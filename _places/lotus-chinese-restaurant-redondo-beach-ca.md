        Excellent food! I do have the same comment as previous tho, they need to
        de-shell the salt & pepper shrimp. It's a pain to eat and the batter
        gets thrown away with the shell. Spicy garlic chicken is good, Black
        Pepper Beef Mignon is delicious! Tried the Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings,
        very nice but one wing still a bit under cooked so they were refunded.
        Would definitely come back again when in the area! They close at 9pm,
        kitchen closes by 830pm so get in there early.

        The service was excellent. We arrived earlier than noon but the server
        seated us without any issue.


        We ordered calamari, xiao long bao, steamed buns, young chow fried rice
        and shrimp lo mein. The calamari seasoning was delicious however it was
        a bit tough chewy. The xiao long bao was average and we didn’t care for
        the steamed buns. The fried rice and lo mein were Delicious! The fried
        rice was flavorful and not soggy.

        I recently dined at this charming spot and was thoroughly impressed! The
        restaurant offers a variety of delicious vegan options that cater to all
        tastes. The warm and relaxed atmosphere made it the perfect place to
        unwind, and the lovely patio was a delightful setting for a meal,
        especially on a nice day right before sunset. Service was quick and
        courteous, with staff who were attentive without being intrusive.
        Whether you're vegan or just looking for a great place to eat, this
        restaurant is definitely worth a visit!

        I live nearby and was initially excited about the opening of Lotus Asian
        Grill, but after dining there twice, I'm hesitant to go back anytime
        soon.


        FOOD:

        I opted out of getting the fancy lobster/truffle/filet mignon dishes
        because I believe a great Pan-Asian restaurant should be able to nail
        traditional dishes. I also wanted to order dishes I would normally place
        considering my proximity to this location and I'm likely not going to be
        ordering take-out lobster once or twice a week.  Here's my review of the
        dishes I ordered (in the order they were brought to the table).


        First visit (8/26/2023):

        Mapo Tofu (4/5): Tasty but not as spicy as requested.

        Mongolian Beef (4/5): Very good, but the dish was basically half onions

        Fried Calamari (2/5): They use large squid cut in big pieces so it was
        chewy; batter was thick so the calamari was overly oily; the sauce
        (ketchup+mayo?) was also heavy and didn't help cut the oiliness

        Pad Thai (5/5): Outstanding, generous portions of noodles and protein. 
        I'd say one of the best in the area

        Braised String Beans (4/5): On par with similar dishes I've had; nice
        sweet soy flavor; string beans cooked perfectly

        Crispy Crabmeat Cream Cheese Wonton: Never served, removed from bill.


        Second visit (8/31/23):

        Salmon Carpaccio (3/5): Labeled as "carpaccio" but served room
        temperature instead of cold; didn't have microgreens but tasted good
        though.

        Crispy Honey Shrimp (2/5): Had high hopes for this - batter was soggy;
        nice sweet taste but the shrimp was suspiciously VERY salty leaving a
        bad finish

        Spicy Seafood Soup (2/5): Good except for overly salty shrimp. Just like
        the dish above, the shrimp tasted like they were sitting in a salt brine
        for so long that it penetrated throughout the protein. After biting into
        them, it altered the taste of the dish entirely

        Spicy Garlic Chicken (3/5): Not extra spicy, as requested; basic
        sweet-savory chicken dish with veggies. ***I actually ordered this after
        being told that the Spicy Peppercorn Fish Fillet and the Spicy
        Peppercorn Beef were no longer being served.  I was advised that most
        spicy dishes kept getting sent back because guests said they were too
        spicy.  This is a bummer since I am a fan of spicy [traditional Chinese]
        food.

        Crispy Crabmeat Cream Cheese Wonton (4/5): On par with similar dishes
        I've had.

        Garlic Brussel Sprouts: Never served, removed from the bill.


        SERVICE:

        Terrible service, wrong orders on both visits, server never checked on
        us, slow, and disorganized.  Dishes were brought out one at a time in
        weird sequences and times where entrees came out before apps.  It felt
        like there was no person in charge - servers and bussers were in chaos
        and always needed to be flagged down.  For the level of class I believe
        Lotus is trying to portray, the service is bad, if not, one of the worst
        in the area.  If not for their social media manager's (Daniela?) energy,
        I'd give it a "0."  Yes, it was that bad.


        VERDICT:

        Lotus Asian Grill needs improvement. The food had some hits but was
        overall slightly underwhelming, and the service was exceptionally poor. 
        I agree with a review on Yelp and don't know where all these 5-star
        reviews (Google/Yelp) are coming from because I heard so many similar
        complaints from other diners around me.  I'll wait and see if things
        change before considering another return.
