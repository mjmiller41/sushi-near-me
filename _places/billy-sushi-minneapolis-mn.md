        This was our first time dining at Billy’s Sushi, and it certainly won’t
        be our last. From the moment we walked in, we were impressed by the
        inviting atmosphere—modern yet comfortable, with a lively energy that
        made for a great dining experience.


        The service was outstanding. Our server took the time to walk us through
        the menu, offering thoughtful recommendations and ensuring we had
        everything we needed. It’s always a pleasure when a restaurant staff is
        not only knowledgeable but also genuinely enthusiastic about the food
        they serve.


        Speaking of food—every dish was beautifully presented and packed with
        flavor. The sushi was fresh, expertly prepared, and had just the right
        balance of textures and flavors. Whether you’re a sushi connoisseur or
        just dipping your toes into the world of raw fish, there’s something
        here for everyone.


        One small request—please consider adding blue cheese-stuffed olives for
        martinis. That little touch would be the cherry on top, and I’d be back
        even sooner!


        Overall, Billy Sushi delivers on atmosphere, service, and top-quality
        sushi. Highly recommend!

        Billy Sushi definitely lived up to the hype. I’m not usually a sushi
        person because I don’t think the value is worth it, but for once in my
        American life I found a sushi spot that is worth going back to again and
        again. The experience here was remarkable. I loved the presentation and
        color of the sushi. Each roll had its own distinct flavor that left me
        craving more. Our waiter Ryan was so friendly and attentive which makes
        a huge difference in customer perception. And lastly, Ryan comped us 2
        sakes and my beer because it was my birthday. It’s the details and acts
        like that, that make you wanting to come back. We were also able to pair
        our dinner with their basement lounge, which made the night even more
        special. Thank you Billy Sushi!

        Great sushi place! The spring rolls were amazing. Could eat those all
        day long. Bluefin tuna is a must. Our waitress was amazing and so
        helpful. All her recommendations were spot on, she really made our
        experience even better. Even gave me a birthday shot of sake! We sat in
        the bar area and I actually really enjoyed that, it felt a little more
        “private” but the whole restaurant has a great vibe.

        Great experience! We were sat right away when we arrived and greeted by
        the server very quickly. Our server was on point with when she stopped
        by for ordering drinks, apps, then other food. We order the Salmon
        Carpaccio, gyoza, yellowtail & fatty tuna nigiri, George Clooney & B.A.D
        & Boujee. Favorites were the salmon carpaccio and funny tuna nigiri.
        Fish was a very impressive quality and tasted great being in Minnesota!
        Price point was a little spendy but I thought it was worth it given the
        high quality or service and well done food. Major plus is the menus had
        photos of the food!

        Solid 4/5! The sushi rolls were the highlight of the night for us. My
        partner and I had reserved a table on a Monday night. Sashimi was so
        fresh and melted in our mouths! Wasn’t a big fan of the beef udon. It
        lacked flavor and unami. The beef was tough and it didn’t work with the
        dish. I would skip the udon if you can. Service was good, it could’ve
        been better but we really loved the vibes & music! We’ll be back to try
        more food :)
