        It is a very small restaurant with about 4 tables inside,  6 tables
        outside and a small bar.  Do make a reservation as they fill up quickly!
        We sat outside in February but it was fine because they have lots of
        heaters! You can also get a partial view  of the lake from their
        patio.The service is prompt and friendly and food is delicious.

        2nd time dining here :) Sushi is fresh and yummy, service is friendly
        and swift. Price is pretty high but worth it. We'll definitely be coming

        Very nice food, service and vibe. The Yamame sashimi plate was fresh and
        delicious. The cuts were thick, which allows one to actually taste the
        fish as one have to chew more. I liked the presentation as well, very
        natural and creative. The only issue I found was that it was a bit
        pricey. The yakisoba was well done and was not as sweet and drenched in
        teriyaki sauce. I liked the wooden bowl it was served in. Karage chicken
        was probably my favorite here, well fried, crunch on the outside and
        juicy on the inside. I could taste the chicken that was well seasoned.
        The edamame was decent, but the portion could be more generous. The udon
        was a bit disappointing, although the noodles were chewy and seemed
        fresh. The soup base was a bit flat, having no depth or "udon" flavor,
        just salty and soy sauce flavor. Tempura was pretty well done, except
        that sweet potatoes were still a bit hard, which means it could have
        used a few more seconds in the fryer. Overall, it was pleasant and good,
        especially the servers were trying their best to be as friendly as
        possible although they were swamped, and my server took a bit long to
        bring out the appetizer gioza, as well as extra napkins.

        My girlfriend and I enjoyed a fantastic dinner here after a walk around
        the lake. We had the Wahu and Gimo special rolls and they were superb!
        Fresh and masterfully crafted. This is our new favorite Sushi place.

        The food was sooooo good and fresh. I got the Koko roll and shared with
        my two family members who also got rolls, Yakisoba and miso soup. The
        fish tasted great and the sauces were very flavorful! And there was a
        pretty good amount for the price! The people severing were so kind and
        kept checking up on us.
