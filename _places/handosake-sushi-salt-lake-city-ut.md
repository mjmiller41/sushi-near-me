        Really awesome sushi bar experience! Everything was delicious,
        especially the fresh nigiri!!!


        We started with the Rock Shrimp, wonton tacos, and crispy rice. Rock
        Shrimp were the fav!


        Then we had several hand rolls including the Lobster and negitoro.


        Nigiri I HiGHLY recommend the Torched Sablefish and the Hamachi with
        Ponzu.


        The Watermelon Marg was amazing and my friends enjoyed the Handosake Old

        How lovely this place is! I and my partner found the place unexpectedly
        when we were looking for a restaurant for a dinner.


        They have a beautiful interior and amazing staffs. I’m unfortunately
        allergic to some of seafood that they adjusted my order that I was able
        to enjoy my dinner very well!


        I’m also very picky about seafood due to my allergy and usually not a
        big fan of spicy tuna fan because of texture of tuna that’s ground but
        they had big chunks of tuna that I actually enjoyed it a lot
        surprisingly. All the things I ordered were so great that I ended up
        eating too much lol.


        Rice was really well cooked and seaweed was very fresh and crisp. The
        chefs were so friendly and amazing for their sushi. I’m definitely
        coming back here when in town!

        Such a fun and laid back atmosphere. Easy going. Sat at the bar & Sendi
        prepared our food right in front of us with SUCH great care. The manager
        was also friendly and social! Went on a night where the owner (Jim)
        introduced himself, friendly as well!

        CANNOT go wrong here. The fish tastes SO fresh🤤

        We had a great experience tonight. We made the mistake of reserving our
        night for the 17th believing it was schedule the 14th for Valentines…
        somehow they made it work and squeezed us in without a reservation. They
        saved the night for sure! We loved the appetizer Rock Shrimp. It was
        quickly demonstrated that Handosake is going for a very natural,
        unaltered/artificial flavor experience. It would do well to have some
        salt or seasoning for the filet mignon or even some unagi sauce for
        rolls, but altogether we really enjoyed ourselves and finished with an
        great Matcha Crème brûlée (no it doesn’t taste like Matcha).
