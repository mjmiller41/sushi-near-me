        Absolutely loved our experience!

        The food was delicious—every dish was delicious and well prepared and
        beautifully presented. Our server, Lewis, was phenomenal! He was kind,
        respectful, courteous, and incredibly helpful throughout our meal. He
        made us feel truly welcomed and taken care of. We’ll definitely be
        coming back—highly recommend!

        Recently moved back to Cortez. This is my 3rd time ordering lunch for
        pick up. I had the Salmon Protein Bowl. It was delicious. Generous
        serving and they do not skip out on the sauce.


        Today Luis assisted me and considering I have ordered lunch from here
        more than once—He was the first server to share the STONEFISH SUSHI
        LOYALTY LUNCH CARD with me. He also educated me on how and when to use
        it. “Buy 6 lunch entrees from the lunch menu and the 7th is Free.” Luis
        also packed chop sticks and soy sauce for me. This also had not been
        done in the past. Definitely noticed his attention to detail.

        It was disheartening it took three trips to learn about the Loyalty
        Card. However, the food was delicious all of those previous times. I
        would be 1/2 to my loyalty reward. 😂 This is more of a front end
        training opportunity rather than food quality/service.


        I highly recommend and looking forward to additional meals here.

        Stopped here after being in the mountains for a week. Wow! The food was
        amazing. I ordered the Shrimp TNT roll just to try something new. I was
        not disappointed. It was a little spicy, but the flavors were intense
        and absolutely delicious.

        Prices are a little steep, but what isn’t these days? I just ordered the
        one item and it was plenty.

        My friend ordered the rainbow roll and liked it as well.

        Service was OK at the bar. A little more attention would have been
        appreciated as they weren’t that busy, but they were talking with
        someone about working there so no worries.

        It’s definitely a cool place and probably the best place to eat in
        Cortez. Not a ton of good options in town.
