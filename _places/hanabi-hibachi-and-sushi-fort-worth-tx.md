        This is an updated after our 2nd visit April 21st,2025

        Had a bad experience. Had a birthday party Monday night with the family.
        My wife found a 1 inch metal screw in her rice. No picture we were in
        shock the cook apologized repeatedly but in the end laughed it off.
        Nothing was offered and I still gave my normal tip. I thought long and
        hard before posting but felt it was necessary. Unfortunately, it killed
        the mood of our group.


        We had 7pm reservation for a group of 10 and was seated on time. It
        seems dark inside but when seated at grill not so bad.

        We had the Miso and Salad to start I had the Korean BBQ with mixed
        vegetables and fried rice, the wife had a Sushi Roll and I can't
        remember which one, but it was very good and she shared. The beef was
        better than I expected  doused in soy sauce very tender the vegetables
        were really good and fresh, fried rice was a meh.

        Service was good drinks were mixed well, this was all about celebrating
        our Gransons 11 birthday which he loved. A really neat place to
        celebrate for the kids which they can interact with the chef and family.
        Needless to say he had a blast and that made it a great evening.

        The sushi and Jimmy at the sushi bar are awesome. That was a great
        experience. I will be back, sorry I didn't take any photos, but I will
        next time. I gave a 1 star for service and allow me to explain. The
        waitress never made eye contact. Never checked to see if we wanted
        another drink or anything. I had to request the sushi chef to interrupt
        the group of gabbing waitresses to get my check. She brought it over to
        the seat beside me because all of the empty plates were in front of us.
        I actually had to tell her to remove my plate so that I can sign the
        credit card slip.  Your management should work on proper training on
        waiting of tables and your guests.


        My second visit was fabulous with the chef making a wonderful assortment
        of sushi to try.  There are a lot of choices in this area, but you won't
        find one better.


        The sushi bar service is superb. The server came by and took my empty
        dishes. They now have received 5 stars in all categories.


        I'm now a regular here. This is my sushi place. I always eat at the
        sushi bar.

        I had an amazing salmon belly sushi and can't wait to go again.

        Beautiful interior and design. Came here for sushi and the sushi rice
        was  crumbly and not very sweet as to be expected. The slices for sushi
        were very think which for some may be great for portioning but even the
        hand rolls look as if they were cut and rolled quickly without care.
        Taste was still very good and especially enjoyed the white tuna and
        extra sweet shrimp they provided.

        The overall atmosphere is quiet, laid-back very chill. The hibachi side
        had quite a bit of people compared to the two people in the dining side.
        Right off the bat I noticed the lack of server training in this
        location. The dumplings were a little bland and lacked flavor.
        Displaying the dumplings on a colorful dish might be more appealing to
        the eye. The tower was very flavorful. It was paired with a lot of
        delicious sauces. the sushi was overall pretty decent. The Poké bowl
        wasn’t bad. It was just missing a sauce for more flavor. We did add the
        leftover sauce from the tower to the poke bowl and it made a huge
        difference. Overall food wasn’t bad. Perfect if you want a quiet
        restaurant to do some work. The most dissatisfying thing from my
        experience was the service.

        The atmosphere is quite vibrant, particularly in the Hibachi area.
        Unfortunately, the food didn't meet my expectations. My Hibachi meal,
        which came with a salad, soup, chicken, fried rice, and vegetables, was
        merely average. Given the price, I had anticipated something better. The
        fried rice was particularly disappointing; it tasted more like plain
        white rice with some soy sauce rather than the flavorful dish I
        expected. I had ordered two sides of fried rice, thinking it would
        enhance my meal, but it didn't even come with the main course, which was
        an extra charge.


        The chicken was decent, the salad was refreshing but unremarkable, and
        the soup was a bit too salty for my taste. Since I'm sensitive to
        sodium, that was a downside for me. Overall, I would rate my meal a 2.5
        out of 5.


        The service left much to be desired. After placing my order, I mentioned
        that I would likely be ordering takeout for my partner. The server
        acknowledged this, but when I later tried to place the takeout order,
        she seemed irritated. I had already indicated my intention to order food
        to go.


        Additionally, my friend ordered sushi without avocado due to her
        allergy, and the server nodded in understanding. However, when the sushi
        arrived, my friend reminded the server about the allergy, and the server
        reacted with a disdainful expression and eye roll. It’s unclear if she
        was having a rough day, but my friend had clearly communicated her
        allergy. We also had to repeat ourselves several times, which made me
        wonder if there was a language barrier. Overall, the customer service
        was lacking, characterized by eye rolls and visible annoyance, although
        the front desk staff were friendly.


        As a result, I won’t be returning. The food didn’t justify the cost, and
        the service from our server was disappointing. I hope others have a
        better experience with both the food and the service.
