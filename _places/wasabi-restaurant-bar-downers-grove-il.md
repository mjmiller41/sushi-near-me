        Located in downtown Downers Grove, this restaurant is a decent stop off
        Main Street.  We went later in the day for dinner.


        I had the Korean beef stone bowl (pictured), wife had the short rib
        stone bowl and our 10yr old had the teriyaki steak children's meal.  For
        drinks, my son had the Japanese drink with that marble thing you need to
        pop down into the bottle.  Myself and my wife had green tea which they
        heat water and bring the tea bags out for you to determine how strong
        you want your tea..


        I thought my meal was good, it had great flavoring.  The rice on the
        bottom of the bowl will cook and be crispy and a lot of heat (not spicy
        but actually temperature) will be on the bottom and center.  There will
        be a lot of oil on the bottom of the bowl as well.  My wife said my
        choice tasted better than hers and she mentioned hers was too salty.  My
        son liked his meal although they neglected to add the white rice that
        was supposed to come with it (he didn't care so we didn't bother).  My
        wife also wanted a second cup of hot water and was going to reuse her
        tea bag (she doesn't need it strong) but that hot water never made it
        out.


        All said and done, it's probably closer to 3.5 stars overall and could
        easily be 4 if more attention to detail was made.  Meal was just over
        $54 so add a tip and for the three of us it's not terrible.


        For parking, we used the lot for the library but there is street parking
        as well.

        Located in downtown Downers Grove, this restaurant is a decent stop off
        Main Street.  We went later in the day for dinner.


        I had the Korean beef stone bowl (pictured), wife had the short rib
        stone bowl and our 10yr old had the teriyaki steak children's meal.  For
        drinks, my son had the Japanese drink with that marble thing you need to
        pop down into the bottle.  Myself and my wife had green tea which they
        heat water and bring the tea bags out for you to determine how strong
        you want your tea..


        I thought my meal was good, it had great flavoring.  The rice on the
        bottom of the bowl will cook and be crispy and a lot of heat (not spicy
        but actually temperature) will be on the bottom and center.  There will
        be a lot of oil on the bottom of the bowl as well.  My wife said my
        choice tasted better than hers and she mentioned hers was too salty.  My
        son liked his meal although they neglected to add the white rice that
        was supposed to come with it (he didn't care so we didn't bother).  My
        wife also wanted a second cup of hot water and was going to reuse her
        tea bag (she doesn't need it strong) but that hot water never made it
        out.


        All said and done, it's probably closer to 3.5 stars overall and could
        easily be 4 if more attention to detail was made.  Meal was just over
        $54 so add a tip and for the three of us it's not terrible.

        I had a wonderful time at Wasabi.


        The staff are quick and attentive, the atmosphere is relaxed, and the
        food is great.


        This was probably my 9th time going here give or take and I have never
        had a poor experience. When I go with my parents we always get the sushi
        boat and when I go with my girlfriend for date night, I get sesame
        chicken(as seen in the pic, I had a bite or two) or the panang curry.
        You honestly can not go wrong with your choices.


        My only wish is that there were more seating as it's usually busy but I
        can tell they do their best to seat everyone as quickly as they can. To
        me, it's good sign. It shows that the place is ran/staffed well and that
        it's worth the money.

        I was looking for somewhere to eat late on a Sunday with my husband and
        we ended up at Wasabi and loved it! The restaurant looks plain on the
        outside but the inside is really cute. The service was great and the
        food was delicious. I got a vegan bento box and there was so much food I
        had to bring some home. My husband loved his steak hibachi.


        The worst thing is that I’m from out of town and won’t get to come back
        soon! Bonus points for delicious vegan options!

        First time trying this place.  If I could give a 4.5 I would.  The
        parking seemed limited.  The staff were nice when I walked in, the food
        was already prepared and I arrived a little earlier than the expected
        preparation time which was nice.  In my opinion the music was playing a
        little too loudly, but to each their own.  The fish tasted fresh and the
        only thing I didn’t love was the sweet potato roll.  I’m not a fan of
        the sweet potato chunks in tempura, makes for a weird texture.  Other
        than that I would definitely recommend checking this place out.
