        I ordered sashimi from here twice. It is incredibly fresh. My friend
        from the east coast told me it’s the best sashimi he’s ever had. I don’t
        understand why this place doesn’t have five stars, but maybe that’s
        because I’m from Russia and my palette is not sensitive enough to
        understand the finer points of this heavenly cuisine. The price is very
        reasonable.

        If you're looking for an unforgettable sushi experience, Yoji Sushi
        House delivers with impeccable flavors, fresh ingredients, and stunning
        presentation. Our visit was nothing short of spectacular, and every dish
        left a lasting impression.


        We started with the Uni & Crab Chawanmushi, a velvety steamed egg
        custard topped with sweet, briny uni. The combination of silky smooth
        chawanmushi and delicate crab made for a luxurious first bite.


        Next came the hamachi carpaccio, served with creamy avocado, a hint of
        citrus, and a drizzle of house sauce. The thinly sliced yellowtail
        melted in our mouths, and the touch of spice from the garnishes made it
        an exciting dish.


        The showstopper was the chirashi don, a beautifully arranged bowl of
        premium seafood over seasoned sushi rice. The variety of textures—from
        the creamy uni and ikura to the tender scallop and perfectly seared
        salmon—made each bite a delight.


        Sashimi & Omakase

        The selection of nigiri was phenomenal—each piece melting in the mouth
        with the perfect balance of rice and seafood. From buttery salmon and
        seared wagyu to delicately placed uni on crispy tempura, every bite
        showcased the chef’s skill and attention to detail. The gentle heat from
        wasabi and jalapeño added an exciting contrast, elevating the natural
        umami of each ingredient.


        Dragon Roll

        The dragon roll was a visual and flavorful masterpiece. With crispy
        tempura shrimp wrapped in perfectly seasoned rice, topped with creamy
        avocado and rich, caramelized eel, it had the ideal balance of crunch
        and silkiness. The sweet and savory eel sauce tied everything together
        beautifully.


        Double Toro Roll

        If you’re a fan of rich, melt-in-your-mouth tuna, the Double Toro Roll
        is a must-try. Featuring layers of fresh, lightly seared fatty tuna,
        topped with a savory sauce and jalapeño, this roll delivered a perfect
        balance of creaminess and heat. The slight smokiness from the sear added
        depth to every bite.


        Crunchy Snow White Roll

        Topped with vibrant green tobiko, this roll had a great crunch, but the
        addition of almonds made it a bit strange. While the textures were
        interesting, the nuttiness didn’t quite blend with the other flavors,
        making it a bit of a hit-or-miss dish.


        Yoji Sushi House delivers high-quality sushi with fresh ingredients and
        expert preparation. The ambiance is cozy, and the presentation is
        visually appealing. Overall, it’s a great spot for sushi lovers.

        Absurd experience. I’ve eaten here several times and enjoyed the food.
        But today, at 4 in the afternoon on a sunny day, I entered and sat at a
        four top by myself in the otherwise mostly empty restaurant. The space
        isn’t air conditioned, so I wanted to sit near the door with a breeze.
        Pretty typical/normal.


        I was told I needed to move to one of the small 2-person tables in the
        back to leave room for big tables. This was absurd given that there were
        several four-person tables with only two people sitting at them. And
        remember, it’s 4pm. Not exactly prime time.


        I was given the option to move, or leave. I left.


        Really absurd. I wonder whether their owner would have approved of the
        server making that decision. Seems unlikely.

        I can’t say enough about this restaurant. My bf was hesitate at first
        because the outside the restaurant look little dark and the name of the
        restaurant was not very clear but we still wanted to try after checking
        all the reviews on yelp and here.

        OMG, I’m so happy we did. What a amazing Japanese restaurant in SF with
        very good deal specially during Happy hours.

        The fish are so fresh and best quality, the other food is also very good
        as well.

        We love Japanese food and we always try to find a Japanese restaurant
        that we don’t have to wait hours or book way ahead if it’s popular ones
        and of course not overpriced like many other Japanese restaurants.

        Please come to try to support their business and I’m sure you will be
        coming every week just like us. Many street parking available along the
        sidewalk.

        I would give 10 stars if I could.

        Quaint sushi restaurant situated at the laguna Honda intersection. Was
        greeted immediately upon walking in on Friday night. We were going to
        order 2 regular Chirashi, but the waitress insisted on getting the
        Deluxe Chirashi. Quality of the fish was superior to those I tried in
        the Sunset. Highly recommend ! Deluxe is always worth it (just an
        additional $6)
