        I have to say I'm a little surprised by all the negative reviews... Not
        to discredit them, but my boyfriend and I have been here multiple times
        and we absolutely love Raku. Some rolls are better than others, but
        every time we visit, we have a great experience. My absolute FAVORITE
        roll has to be the Bevo, but there are so many options to explore that
        you could spend forever and a day ordering there. I WILL say that last
        time we visited, the service left something to be desired (we watched
        our server play on her phone for several minutes when our sushi was
        ready for "delivery"), but that was an irregularity, not a norm for us
        here. :)

        WHEN I SAY AMAZING FOOD!!

        The server was young and on her phone a lot so there was a bit of
        waiting on her, but THE FOOD was amazing and tasty!! I came here because
        I needed cooked Sushi and they double checked for me before I ordered to
        make sure everything I wanted was in fact cooked, the flavors were
        everything!! And the prices were absolutely fair! We spent about $85 and
        got 3 rolls of sushi, 1 bowl of ramen, and 2 appetizers.

        We will definitely be going back!

        If I could give zero stars, I would. My friends and I spent over $300 at
        Raku, expecting to enjoy a good meal, but instead, we were rudely rushed
        out the moment we paid.


        First, a staff member came up and told us, “You guys have been here for
        a while. Please leave.” This was right as we were figuring out how to
        split the check—something that takes just a few minutes. Five minutes
        later, another staff member came by again telling us to leave. It was
        clear they were more concerned about flipping tables than treating
        paying customers with respect.


        For a restaurant where you’re dropping that much money, you’d expect at
        least a little hospitality. Instead, we were made to feel unwelcome the
        second we finished eating. If you value good service and a place where
        you’re not treated like an inconvenience, avoid this place. Plenty of
        other restaurants in town actually respect their customers.
