        I had the most delightful dining experience here! The ramen was
        absolutely divine—the broth was rich and flavorful, complemented by
        tender beef, perfectly cooked eggs, and fresh toppings like corn and
        scallions that added a nice crunch. The curry rice bowl was comforting
        and hearty, with vibrant vegetables and a mildly spiced sauce that was
        just the right balance of savory and sweet. The sushi was incredibly
        fresh, with the salmon and tuna practically melting in my mouth.
        Everything was beautifully presented, and the attention to detail in
        each dish was evident. Highly recommend this spot for anyone looking for
        authentic and delicious cuisine!


        Please note The curry is Korean inspired

        The nicest workers ever, very hospitable and relaxing environment. Got
        the tuna nigiri, chashu with pork broth, and seaweed salad all great in
        their own right, but the best was the seaweed salad. Very refreshing
        light salad that helped to cleanse my palate.

        Pros are really wide menu selection of various Asian cuisines. Also, the
        waitress was really friendly. I got the galbi which sadly wasn’t cooked
        at our table but it did come on a sizzling platter. It was a great
        portion for $28 - 4 banchan and rice were included. Kids and hubby got
        sushi and poke. I’m actually glad I stuck with the hot food but they
        seemed to enjoy their meals. Next time I’d like to try the ramen!


        Cons were location isn’t the best and I’m just not a big anime fan but
        their walls have anime drawings. Not a big deal at all; I’d still eat
        here!

        Lovely welcome, came for a snack stayed for the space, friendly hole in
        the wall. Naruto vibes, environment was calm and clean. Michelle took
        care of us and recommended the popular options. We enjoyed them all. I
        Realized that I ate all the food before I could snap a picture. Says
        something 🤫

        Naruto roll highly recommended !!!

        Seaweed salad was one of the best I’ve had. 💚

        Thank you Michelle!

        This lil hide away is probably one of my favorite ramen spots. It was my
        first solo adventure when I moved to Austin when they were located next
        to UT campus! Staff has always made me feel welcomed. If you’re looking
        for a restaurant that feels as tho you’re hanging out at a friend’s home
        this is it! I’ve tried most of the ramens they have to offer same with
        their appetizers. Nothing has disappointed me yet
