        We have seen an increase in quality over the last year as well as
        presentation.  We ordered a regular sushi meal (super fresh!), and three
        creative rolls. We were pleasantly surprised by two of the flavors that
        we selected. They seemed very unique and they tasted so good. One was
        the Lemon tree roll and the other one was the Salmon Tar Tar. We would
        definitely order these again. Last roll was a B-1 roll, it was quite
        flavorful too (last pic).


        Their lunch specials are also very good advertised at $12 for two rolls
        or $16 for 3 rolls. But we did not do the lunch.


        I could tell their servers are working hard running around to catch
        orders, walk in customers and take out.


        Today I was especially surprised by their presentation. It looked like a
        countryside scene. Sitting at the bar allowed us to interact with the
        sushi chef which was quite fun as he talked to us about the ingredients.

        BlueFin Sushi Bar & Restaurant is a solid choice for sushi in the area.
        What really made our visit memorable was the server. Even though she was
        the only one working, she made everyone feel welcome and managed to
        bring a quick laugh each time she refilled drinks or delivered food. The
        sushi was very good (though a bit on the pricier side for a lunch) the
        experience overall was enjoyable. The restaurant itself is clean and
        modern, and watching the sushi rolls prepared right in front of us was a
        nice touch. Thanks to the exceptional server, our meal truly stood out.
        If you’re in the area, I recommend giving BlueFin a try!
