        Went here for Valentine’s Day with the wife and it was such a nice small
        and intimate vibe. It’s not your typical modern dining with over the top
        things and dimmed lighting etc. it’s a different experience.


        We did the all you can eat, of course. You sit and the young woman took
        our drink order and also asked if we wanted something specific made,
        which we did. We ordered the spicy kani salad which was amazing. I
        forget all the names but I remember a couple being the Fancy roll and
        Godzilla roll. Everything else we ate came straight off the conveyor
        belt. I love that they also threw in chicken nuggets with sweet and sour
        sauce. Got a good laugh and the nuggets were good too 😅🤣


        I would def come back for a date night. Thank you to the workers who
        made it a great first experience.

        A steal of a deal. Go for lunch 25 bucks all you can eat. Sushi is super
        fresh people are crazy nice and it's a experience with the revolving
        belt carrying food items around. Also you can order whatever you would
        like on the menu and they bring it out too! Can't wait to go back

        Very delicious sushi, with a variety of dazzling foods to try. I think
        it's great that you can taste all kinds of food here. Compared to other
        self-service restaurants, the sushi here has less rice and more meat,
        making it very comfortable and satisfying to eat.. Full marks

        Bucket list item crossed off. All ways wanted to visit a rotating sushi
        restaurant … and SHUMI, Didn’t disappoint! Tried so many things, each
        one was fresh and delicious. The variety is amazing and small dishes are
        a nice partial roll. Wish I lived closer I’d be here every week. Fresh.
        Tasty. Very kind and accommodating. This place is a gem

        Was craving sushi while on my trip back to NY, this is the nearest I can
        find. The restaurant is cozy and friendly, making it a great place to
        try yummy sushi and other traditional dishes. Every bite is fresh and
        tasty, showing how much care the chefs put into making the food. The
        staff is nice and helpful, making sure you have a fun time eating there.
        If you want to taste Japan's flavors in a cool restaurant, Shumi is the
        place to go!
