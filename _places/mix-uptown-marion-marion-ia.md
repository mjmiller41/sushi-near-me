        The food Itself was very good once we finally got it. Service was very
        slow. We were seated immediately as there were only three tables total.
        However , it took close to 10 minutes for our server to come over. Our
        server was a very polite young gentleman who informed us on the 20%
        gratuity, as well as the 90 minute time limit. I would think with there
        being a time limit they would put a little more hustle on things and
        would check on you a little bit more often, that was not the case. I
        think we were checked on a total of 4 times including when he brought
        the bill. The meat and vegetables for our hot pot arrived before our
        salads that we were hoping to get as soon as possible. After the 1st
        round of sushi we waited with empty plates for another 10 minutes.  This
        is why I have a problem with the 20% gratuity already added.... I think
        the service suffers terribly because they don't care, knowing that
        they're already going to get that 20% no matter what. We were very
        underwhelmed. We did the hot pot / sushi combo. It was $100 for the 2 of
        us. The hot pot was an ok experience, but it's just like a soup you make
        yourself 🤷🏼‍♀️ I would give the atmosphere a 2 at best, it was meh. We
        will be sticking with Izumi Sushi & Hibachi, they never keep you waiting
        and give excellent service.

        At the start of this year I had never had Hotpot.


        Since my first experience, I've been back every week (sometimes more
        than once 🤫) bringing different people with me every time. They are
        going to start recognizing my car! 😅


        We are obsessed with the AYCE Hotpot!!! For everything you get, it's a
        great deal. Its 3 rounds, with your choice of meats, veggies and other
        add-in, and try as we might weve never made it past the 2nd round. I've
        never left there anything but completely full, and fully satisfied. They
        truly have something for everyone (even a self proclaimed picky eater
        like myself).


        Everything tastes great, the experience is fun, and easy to learn for
        first-timers. The staff is friendly and so accommodating. Eating here
        feels like coming home, to a good meal with family. All of the staff are
        attentive, friendly checking to make sure we have everything we need.


        Service is simply great! Everything is fresh, they keep the soups topped
        off and the servers always check in. I never feel like I'm "waiting".
        Being able to cook you own meats and customize your own soup IS part of
        the experience. I always feel like it really lends to more opportunities
        for connecting with your party. Everyone is cooking their soups, passing
        ingredients and chatting. It a very communal vibe here, offering a more
        intimate and bonding experience all around. You aren't just stuffing
        your face, you're enjoying your time out.


        I cannot say enough good things about this place! Lucky for my friends,
        who get to listen to me talk about it all the time now.  If I keep up
        this pace, I think I might just need to buy a permanent table at this
        fabulous restaurant! 💜

        This place is amazing. For $25 you get a 3 rounds of the hotpot. You get
        3 meats and whatever veggies and noodles you want per round. I am always
        stuffed when I leave this place. It's definitely not a quick bite to eat
        I've spend around 2 hours here each time because the rounds take a while
        along with them preparing everything but it is well with it. It's my go
        to place when I have a bunch of friends getting together to go eat and
        just hang out.

        Me and my girlfriend come here every few weeks. Everytime, we get the
        same results. Pure perfection. We get the all you can eat sushi, and for
        the price you pay? Unbelievable. Usually we get 3 rolls each, with an
        appetizer and desert. Equates to about $6-$8 a roll (Special rolls with
        all the fixings in/on them). Will recommend to everyone about this
        place, it’s a hidden gem for sure.
