        Very very surprised by some of the negative reviews on here. It does not
        track with my experience at all. I came with my wife and sister based on
        the recommendation of my mother. We thought the sushi and food was
        excellent. I have been to Japan, Hawaii, and Korea multiple times. I
        regularly eat at Momotaro and other sushi spots in the city. I have had
        extremely good sushi in my life and I can confidently say the sushi here
        is good. We got the Set B (priced per person) and were impressed by the
        quality, variety, and quantity of the food. The service was also
        excellent. I will definitely come back and bring more people next time.
        I highly recommend giving this place a shot.

        Stopped for quick bite for lunch, place was empty and quiet. I like
        their menus, where you get marker and you mark what you want. I chose
        asparagus roll, because I have never had one. Same goes for Hawaian
        roll, which was server's suggestion. I didn't expect anything
        spectacular, but I was stunned when the food came. Presentation was
        outstanding! Taste was on spot as well, I enjoyed every bite. I heard
        this is Korean style menu, so I was glad to meet another culture thru
        food! Server, who I believe is owner too, was friendly and helpful! Will
        be back to this place

        This place is hands down the best sushi place in Chicago. We ordered 50
        dollar/person hwal-uh sushi course for two people.


        Like many other reviews, YES the wait time for all the tsukidashi to
        come out is VERY LONG. There was only one server and it was pretty slow.
        If you don't like waiting for really good food, then go somewhere else.
        I like this place because of the freshness and the effort they put when
        making food. There are a lot of food so prepare to have empty stomach
        when you go. You will not regret the long wait. also Cloud beer was an
        awesome pair to fresh sashimi.


        The only downside is they didn't provide water from the get go... I had
        to ask for it.

        I had a truly shocking experience at  that I can't keep to myself. While
        enjoying what I hoped would be a delightful meal, I discovered bugs and
        even pubic hair in my food. I was completely appalled.


        The moment I saw the bugs, I felt nauseated and disgusted. It ruined my
        appetite and left me feeling incredibly uneasy about the cleanliness of
        the restaurant. To find something so unappetizing in my food is
        unacceptable in any dining establishment, let alone a sushi place where
        freshness is key.


        When I brought this to the staff's attention, their response was
        lackluster at best. I felt dismissed and unheard, as if my concerns were
        unimportant. Instead of an apology or a genuine effort to make things
        right, the staff seemed indifferent.


        This experience not only ruined my meal but also left me feeling anxious
        about the safety and hygiene of the food I had just consumed. I will
        never return to, and I strongly advise others to think twice before
        dining there. It’s a shame because I was looking forward to enjoying
        some sushi, but this experience was nothing short of horrifying.

        Holy moly the best Korean seafood I've had in the midwest. We got the
        $40 course meal and it exceeded expectations in every way. The sashimi
        was incredibly fresh. The fried fish was seasoned delightfully, the
        tempura and tofu was cooked to perfection. Even the small seafood salad
        sides were so yummy we couldn't get over it. The 매운탕 at the end was
        really the cherry on top of a wonderful experience. Please give your
        money to this establishment, you won't be disappointed.
