        Jellyfish Sushi & Grill is a casual Japanese restaurant located in a
        somewhat rundown strip mall, but at least there’s plenty of free
        parking. We visited on a Sunday evening with our 14-month-old son and
        immediately noticed that it’s very family-friendly—several other
        families with kids were dining, and they provided high chairs, which was
        convenient.


        The menu offers a mix of hibachi entrées, nigiri sushi, and rolls. I
        ordered the House Delight Hibachi Entrée ($23), which included chicken
        and shrimp grilled with light seasoning, along with onion soup, ginger
        salad, hibachi vegetables, and fried rice (an extra $3). My son had the
        Kid’s Teriyaki Chicken ($8), which was just teriyaki chicken and white
        rice.


        My wife tried three sushi rolls:


        1) Jellyfish Roll ($15) – Spicy tuna, sliced pepper tuna, cucumber,
        gochujang, and microgreens.


        2) Texas Himachi Roll ($15) – Yellowtail, shrimp tempura, sliced
        jalapeño, and ponzu sauce.


        3) Cherry Blossom Roll ($14) – Cucumber, avocado, microgreens, salmon,
        tuna, ponzu sauce, scallions, and soy paper.


        Overall, the food was fine—nothing special, but it was not bad either.
        The flavors were decent, but nothing really stood out. The service,
        however, was great—our waiter checked on us frequently and made sure we
        had everything we needed.


        If you’re looking for a fast, casual spot for a quick Japanese meal with
        family, this place works. If you’re after high-quality sushi or standout
        hibachi flavors, you might want to look elsewhere.

        Enjoyed a fantastic lunch at Jellyfish! The jellyfish roll was a
        standout, and my husband’s hibachi beef was perfectly cooked. Cozy vibe,
        deliciously fresh martini, and loved the homemade ginger salad dressing.
        Bonus points for the thoughtful hand wipes at the end!

        It was an absolute pleasure dining at jellyfish! Vibes were great, super
        clean inside, AC was blasting, music was chill.


        If this is your first time coming here, I highly recommend starting with
        the K-pop salmon roll and the jellyfish roll. Both specialty rolls had a
        an explosion of rich tasting flavor.


        Service was also very good. I don’t remember our server’s name, but he
        was attentive and very generous! I would definitely come back.

        Jellyfish is an awesome spot! The food is amazing, the restaurant is
        very clean, and the service is great. I thought the jellyfish roll was
        tasty (as it's the one I had upon my first visit) but boy was I wrong,
        the Citrus Hamachi roll is just mouth watering. Don't get me wrong,
        they're all good! Also had the Shaggy Dog, Chicken Yakisoba, and Spicy
        Fried Rice (this was amazing as well!). If it weren't as far out as it
        is from me I would probably be going 1-2 times/week. Amazing food and
        service!

        I had the most incredible dining experience at Jellyfish sushi and
        grill! From the moment I walked in, the ambiance was warm and inviting,
        with just the right blend of modern elegance and traditional Japanese
        charm.


        The sushi was absolutely divine—every piece was crafted with care and
        precision. The freshness of the fish was unmatched, and the flavors were
        perfectly balanced. I highly recommend trying their Chirashi, Sweet
        Shrimp, Crazy Rolls, and Tuna Tataki; it was a true highlight of the
        meal.


        The staff was exceptional—attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely
        passionate about their craft. They took the time to explain each dish
        and made fantastic recommendations based on my preferences.


        The attention to detail here is impeccable, from the presentation of the
        dishes to the thoughtful service.


        If you're a sushi lover or just looking for an unforgettable meal,
        Jellyfish Sushi and Grill is a must-visit. I can’t wait to return and
        explore more of their menu since I am only 15 mins away from this little
        gem.
