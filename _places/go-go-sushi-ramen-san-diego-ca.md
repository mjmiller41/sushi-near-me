        I went to Go Go Sushi and Ramen for an early lunch, the food was not bad
        but not great. The tuna sashimi was chewy and had veins in it, and was
        containing a lack of freshness. The Unagi Don was above average, the
        sweetness of the teriyaki sauce and the saltiness of the eel was
        delicious. The Tonkotsu Ramen was above average, the broth was
        fulfilling and rich, and the noodles were cooked well. The Chasiu/ BBQ
        pork was tender, but the one downside was that the egg was cooked
        through, when it should be runny and smooth. The Bulgogi Tofu was
        mediocre, since the tofu was smooth.

        I went to Go Go Sushi and Ramen for an early lunch, the food was not bad
        but not great. The tuna sashimi was chewy and had veins in it, and was
        containing a lack of freshness. The Unagi Don was above average, the
        sweetness of the teriyaki sauce and the saltiness of the eel was
        delicious. The Tonkotsu Ramen was above average, the broth was
        fulfilling and rich, and the noodles were cooked well. The Chasiu/ BBQ

        Very convenient spot to have a quick lunch. The store is not big and
        quite, it’s nice to be here to hangout, chat and talk stuff. The food
        here is fine, not amazing, but not bad. I ordered a teriyaki salmon
        bento box, it comes with a small bowl of Miso soup, salad, small portion
        tempura, four pieces sushi roll,  a piece of teriyaki salmon and white
        rice. The bento box has right amount of food for one person. If you like
        bento box, this place is not a bad choice.

        My husband and I came in on an impromptu date night, and we left
        disappointed.

        We chose this place because it was cheaper than another sushi place in
        the area, but still expected a bit more. The interior is cute, but the
        food was not good. I first ordered a Beef Teriyaki rice bowl, but the
        vegetables were falling apart, and the beef was very low-quality. I
        asked for a Veggie Yakiudon instead, and this tasted better than the
        first. He liked his Tonkotsu Ramen, and the sushi was average. Our
        waitress was nice but visibly disappointed when I asked for a new dish.

        We came for a late lunch and it was pretty empty. They came to serve us
        quite quickly. :)


        We ordered:


        - bulgogi bento box: 4/5, the fried vegetables were crunchy, the miso
        soup was delicious, the california roll sushi was okay, and beef bulgogi
        was a bit too sweet


        - the tempura udon: 4/5, the noodle was cooked just perfectly soft and
        chewy, the broth was similar to a shiitake soup


        - the Tamago nigiri: 3/5, i like my sushi room temperature. the nigiri
        was very cold as if it just came out of the freezer. not my personal
        favorite.


        - the Rocking shrimp tempura roll: 3/5, the insides were falling apart.
        it wasn't as crunchy as I had expected. it just didn't seem very fresh.


        Overall, the food was okay. Everything was inexpensive.

        The bento box was a good deal, but the sushi fell apart way too fast and
        the chicken was kind of tough. The miso soup was good, as was the
        tempura so it was overall not too bad.
