        This place is amazing. Pricey, yes. But it has become one of our
        favorites.

        We had a couple mocktails. A pina-con-nada and a Lychee drink with
        hibiscus, I can't remember the name. But they were sweet, but not too
        sweet..so they were refreshing.

        The sushi was amazing. We did the nigiri salmon with chili crisp, it was
        packed with flavor! and the Unagi (eel) melted in our mouth. Wow!

        We did the ahi tuna salad which has tons of fresh veggies And a dressing
        that we weren't sure what it was. But it was delicious.

        We also tried the pork belly lettuce cups.

        They were amazing! Crispy, smokey and saucy. We loved it with the
        pickled onions.

        Service was great. Place is quiet and we loved the theme and vibes.
        Anime art, Ghibli moving playing on the big screen and the place was
        just quiet and chill. Even with all the people around .

        Plenty of parking. Definitely go check this place out. It is a bit
        pricey. But the quality/experience is worth it.

        I went to a special Studio Ghibli Spirited Away themed dinner. It was 9
        courses of absolutely sensational food from the movie! For those not
        familiar with the film, food plays a central role in the story. They
        played it on a projector and like clockwork, every time there was food
        on screen they brought out that dish for us to eat! The staff were all
        excellent. It was my understanding that two of the three servers were
        new and they did awesome. The host, Skyler, was friendly and gregarious.
        The chef knew what he was doing, incredible food! All in all, an amazing
        experience, 100 out of 10 would recommend.

        Fun for a different experience, I wasn't sure what to expect to be
        honest! Plates shown so you can see the price per plate since that
        appears to be a common complaint. We started eating the salmon sashimi
        before I remembered a photo so that's not a great representation of what
        you'll get but you get the idea. We also ordered a few tuna rolls, a
        scallop roll, and tuna sashimi- all not pictured. Their rolls are shaped
        like half of a regular sushi roll but just not cut, to give you an idea!


        We are sashimi lovers so this was a different experience but fun for the
        concept. We spent about $65/person including 1 drink (sake flight) and
        left satisfied, adding this since some people said they've left hungry.
        All in all we had a fun experience and Chef Hannah was lovely to chat
        with! Thank you!

        Under wraps was a refreshing sushi experience, especially for here in
        Utah.

        Skyler, the owner is who served me and he was amazing. I asked him to
        just order for me and he did and amazing job. Everything had amazing
        flavor and you could tell was made from high quality ingredients.


        I would tell you my favorites from the menu but it would just be too
        hard to decide!
