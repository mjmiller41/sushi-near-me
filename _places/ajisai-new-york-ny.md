        This place was great I’m definitely coming back to try other items on
        the menu I rate 8.5 out of 10 it was me and one other person prices are
        great although this was my first time here I can say it felt so chill
        and laid back the servers was great food came out quick the veggie
        dumplings and bow bun are very good must try the drinks was great if you

        Sushi here is delicious and nicely priced for the portion sizes. The
        pancake with the curry sauce was delicious. Paired it with a soju.
        Waitress was sweet and attentive. They also have lunch specials! If you
        are a sushi lover, I would visit. Going to come again!

        Be aware of the lunch menu…. I noticed there’s hardly any “crab” meat in
        the California roll and small shrimp in the tempura roll. I looked at
        the table next to me and she had a normal amount of crab in her
        California roll


        The server said that the “lunch special” gets less crab meat in the
        California roll and the tempura roll gets the small shrimp lol.


        I looked at the menu again and saw for $1.50 more I could’ve gotten the
        regular sized sushi…. Not much of a lunch special…

        I have had on at least 10 occasions the salmon and avocado rolls (always
        reliably delicious), the shrimp tempura-- perfectly tender, puffed up,
        and not greasy, and the Pad Thai with shrimp which is really good,
        ample, and very reasonably priced. The menu is expansive so I need to
        try some other delights.


        I have been to Ajisai at least 15 times in the last year and a half, and
        have always found the food excellent. It always arrives in next to no
        time, is hot (if necessary), flavorful, and exactly as described on the
        menu. But the best part is that it is served by really delightful
        servers. Lately it was Emily.


        The young man, Saul, who greets one at the door, and fills in by doing
        just about everything, is a delight. He is funny, kind, and so hard
        -working. Yet he really does stop to speak with you and show interest
        when you have had a bad day. His regulars (and everyone  really!) are
        treated like royalty and he seems to have a lot of regulars who live
        nearby. To me that is everything. I have seen him perform extraordinary
        acts of kindness in small and big ways, all the while managing every
        last detail of the operation.


        As a flight attendant for 42 years for two major international airlines,
        I really can tell when someone is putting his heart and soul into a
        customer service job (read: emotional labor), especially one as
        difficult as serving demanding New Yorkers.


        Saul gets along with all his staff and speaks multiple languages. He
        puts everyone at ease. Have I extolled him enough?


        I came one day while Ajisai was renovating and he still found time to
        allow me in after a small wait. Now the restaurant has a new softly-lit
        bar area which is appealing (the chef has a wry sense of humor and a
        wide smile), but I really appreciate the fact that the tables along both
        walls have very comfortable banquettes for aching backs. Also, I might
        add that that the cleanliness of the restaurant and its bathroom are
        impeccable.


        Again, come for the really good Japanese/ fusion food, but be pleasantly
        surprised by the very attentive service.


        Do not pass by this great spot for a good meal by oneself or with a
        group of friends.


        Many thanks to the staff for many a pleasant evening.

        Very friendly service, especially by bartender Tapiwa. Ask for his
        "clouds of Tokyo" drink, and tell him not to make it too sweet. Great
        service. Presentation of sushi great. Very fresh. Try salmon

        dumpling. No complaints. I m not sure why I didn't give it 5⭐. Maybe it
        needs to be even more exotic. I've visited twice in one week. Give this
        one a try, for sure.

  place tends to leave visitors feeling pleased with the value and taste.
