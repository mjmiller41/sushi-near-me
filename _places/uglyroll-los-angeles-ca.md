        My daughter says this place is run by the best restaurant owner ever. I
        loved it too (the place and the kind service). Yummy sushi at really
        good prices. Fast, fresh, and delicious omakase. Fire pit with a nice
        size screen. What's not to love? Highly recommended.

        My family’s favorite local spot for delicious and affordable sushi, a
        rarity, served with friendliness. We are sushi fanatics and love how
        fresh the fish is and how generous the servings. Favorites include eel,
        tuna and albacore nigiri, salmon skin salad, Ugly Roll, and the super
        affordable omakase. Food is made right in front of you by the owner who
        makes you feel at home in a way you rarely experience at restaurants
        today. The atmosphere isn’t fancy but comfortable and there are many
        personal touches by the owner. Happy to support this small business.

        Amazing experience! Great, personable, & friendly service/ staff. The
        deals are so cheap too. The $15 combo has so much food and a can drink
        (can beer or soda) included too. No other good quality sushi restaurant
        in LA can get you a dinner for 2, drinks included for $30. Also the
        taste and texture was the best I’ve had so far. Very creamy and/or
        crunchy! Saki bombs weren’t on the menu but they were nice enough to add
        a saki shot to our beers for free! Lots of parking near by

        I recently had the pleasure of dining at Ugly Roll, and I can't say
        enough good things about this gem of a sushi spot! From the moment we
        walked in, the atmosphere was so relaxing—soft lighting, cozy seating,
        and a welcoming vibe that made it the perfect place to unwind.


        The service was absolutely top-tier. The staff was attentive, friendly,
        and genuinely passionate about the food they were serving. They took the
        time to explain the menu and even made great recommendations based on
        our preferences.


        Now, let’s talk about the food—it was nothing short of excellent! We
        started with the tempura, which was perfectly crispy and light, not
        greasy at all. The cucumber roll was fresh and refreshing, with just the
        right balance of flavors. But the star of the show was the Ugly
        Albacore. Wow. The fish was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the
        combination of flavors was unforgettable. Every bite was a delight.


        Ugly Roll has definitely earned a spot on my list of favorite sushi
        places. If you’re looking for a relaxing atmosphere, exceptional
        service, and incredible food, this is the place to go. I can’t wait to
        come back and try more of their menu!

        traditional sushi, I recommend this place. It is one of my favorite
        places in Culver City.
