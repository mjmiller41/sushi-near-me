        Just visited during DC Restaurant Week 2025 and tried the restaurant
        week menu. It was well worth the price. In short, will definitely
        return!


        The appetizer was just okay. The next dishes my friend and I tried were
        the pork belly and beef sukiyaki pot. They met our expectation but
        didn’t blow our mind. The pork belly was soft and a bit sweet. The
        sukiyaki was flavourful with a lot of beef, very good portion. The broth
        is great though a bit salty. The star was the main dish with 7 pieces of
        sashimi and half a roll, amazing quality. Generous portion and
        selection. All pieces were thick cut and very fresh, the rice was of
        high quality. The ebi and yellowtail were my favorite, light and sweet.
        The toro was fatty. Even the roll was carefully made. We didn’t expect
        to be full but was surprised.


        The hojicha pudding is a signature and it exceeded our expectation. Melt
        in your mouth with a slight bitter caramel sauce at the end, the
        pairings were brilliant. The basque cheesecake was creamy and rich.

        Just visited during DC Restaurant Week 2025 and tried the restaurant
        week menu. It was well worth the price. In short, will definitely
        return!


        The appetizer was just okay. The next dishes my friend and I tried were
        the pork belly and beef sukiyaki pot. They met our expectation but
        didn’t blow our mind. The pork belly was soft and a bit sweet. The
        sukiyaki was flavourful with a lot of beef, very good portion. The broth
        is great though a bit salty. The star was the main dish with 7 pieces of
        sashimi and half a roll, amazing quality. Generous portion and
        selection. All pieces were thick cut and very fresh, the rice was of
        high quality. The ebi and yellowtail were my favorite, light and sweet.
        The toro was fatty. Even the roll was carefully made. We didn’t expect
        to be full but was surprised.

        We enjoyed an excellent meal here last night. They have a diverse menu
        with options for a tasting menu, a la carte sashimi, sushi, small to
        large savory plates; quite the range. Service was very polished, very
        knowledgeable and helpful. The ambience was subdued, quiet and intimate.


        We started with a few small and medium plates we really enjoyed overall:


        tako karaage (pan fried octopus w/brussel sprouts & okonomi sauce) -
        superb blend of textures and flavors, from the crisp octopus, tender
        brussel sprouts, to creamy sauce. Delicious.


        ebi kurimu korokke (shrimp cream croquette) - our server recommended
        this one and it was heavenly, robust flavor without every comprising the
        flavor the shrimp.


        kuro buta kaku-ni (black pork belly/10hrs braised in sweetened soy) -
        this was interesting, tender pork belly in a very sweet broth. Not my
        favorite but good and glad I tried it.


        We then went onto the main part of the meal, we shared the Taro Sashimi
        for two. About a dozen types of fish, plus octopus, and clams
        beautifully presented on a long wooden board. My favorite was the Toro,
        it was like butter. We ordered another a la carte sashimi of the Toro,
        it was epic.


        They also have a large sake menu but basically a non-existent cocktail
        menu.


        Excellent restaurant, highly recommend you give it a try.

        Awesome food and great service! We came for restaurant week and were
        stunned at the quality of service. It was an appropriate speed and the
        food came out fresh. The hot foods were hot, and the sushi was not
        overhandled. My favorite part of the meal was dessert. The ほうじ茶プリン was
        divine. Would highly recommend you check out for restaurant week or
        another omakase experience!

        Great and memorable service, food and sake was excellent and though
        prices are high they are reasonable compared to other high-end sushi
        restaurants in DC. It is a restaurant worth the hype.

        We went for the summer restaurant week. You get a cold and a hot
        appetizer, assortment of sushi and a dessert. We opted for the soft
        shell crab and shabu shabu ramen, both were delicious and served hot out
        of the kitchen. Sushi is top quality and decadent of course. Hojicha
        pudding is uniquely toasty and silky.


        Not all RW deals are worth going, but I’d recommend the selection at
        sushi taro for the quality and the value of the food.
