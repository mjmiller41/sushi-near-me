        Left a five star review 8 years ago, and I stand by it. This little
        Burmese greasy spoon is always great and super cheap. Even if the ladies
        behind the counter seem generally uninterested in having you there.
        Perhaps that's half the appeal. Worth the short wait to get a seat.
        Bring cash!

        Yamo is a tiny (and I mean tiny - as in there's the kitchen and right up
        against it there's diner-style seating consisting of maybe 10 stools
        total) restaurant located in the heart of the Mission district. Given
        the small size of the restaurant, many patrons decide to order out;
        however, there is still the option to dine in, but bear in mind you may
        experience a bit of a wait due to the limited real estate. That being
        said - what the restaurant lacks in size, it makes up for in the flavor
        of its food - a straightforward simple menu consisting of classic
        Burmese dishes alongside a variety of other Asian flavors. One last
        thing to keep in mind, is that they are a CASH ONLY establishment, so
        make sure you have cash on hand if you want to dine here!


        My partner and I arrived on Thursday afternoon around 6pm and waited
        about 15-20 minutes to be seated. There isn't a formal waitlist, rather
        dine-in patrons sort of line-up outside the restaurant and the staff
        members (which consist of a mother-daughter duo) call each party in soon
        as there is space. Service is quite quick and you get to watch your food
        prepared right in front of you! We decided to order their tea leaf
        salad, the black bean fish, and Yamo house noodles. If you'd like to
        grab a drink, they direct you to their refrigerator and you're welcome
        to help yourself (drinks are $2 each).


        Our food was ready to eat in about 10-15 minutes, which was astounding
        to me. We started first with the tea leaf salad, a classic Burmese dish,
        with a spicy kick to it. As someone who does not handle their spice
        well, I quickly went to the fridge to grab a drink - a can of Cactus
        Cooler, which is an orange pineapple soda (something I've never seen
        before actually). Despite the spice, the tea leaf salad was light and
        delicious, with the nuts providing a satisfying crunch as well. The
        black bean fish came paired with rice and was delicious. My only comment
        would be that the sauce itself seemed a bit thin, and not as thick as I
        would have liked it; however, that just might be a personal preference.
        The highlight of the meal was definitely their Yamo house noodles - I
        highly recommend it to anyone who comes to dine here. The richly
        flavored garlic noodles paired with your protein of choice, makes for a
        very filling bite - and for only $8, what a steal. Most entrees here are
        just $8 - and for us our meal in total came out to $26 before tip (of
        which they definitely deserve).


        If you're looking for some delicious Burmese/Asian food, then Yamo has
        to be on your list of places to try next!

        Excellent food and service, especially given the price! 8 total seats in
        total, run by a woman and her mom. Recommend the tea salad especially,
        but you won’t go wrong with anything on the menu. Be prepared to wait if
        you wish to dine in, but they also do take out with is a bit faster.
