        we came on for chicago restaurant week and were in for a treat. the tom
        yum soup was by far my favorite — hot and very lemon grass forward.
        delicious. the crispy lobster was very very good as well. rainbow sushi
        was so tender and delicate. overall a good experience. the service was a
        little off, maybe because we were in the last reservation slot (8:30) so
        most of the food came out all at once (instead of coursed) which was a
        little hectic. but i would eat here again

        Amazing!!!! We went here for a double date and the menu had something
        for everyone- fresh sushi, fried tempura, hot bowls of ramen, rice
        bowls, curry… you name it they got it. Everything was authentic and
        fresh. The service was wonderful and they had such creative cocktails,
        like a lychee martini! The mochi board for dessert was so creative and
        delicious. Everyone was so kind to us and we will definitely be back.

        I live close by & always wanted to check this place out. So happy we did
        & as suspected we are big fans now. Highly recommend making a
        reservation as this place is packed to the gills on any given night.
        Even though it feels packed you still have a sense of intimacy and
        privacy at your table. It’s definitely a place to converse and enjoy
        your dinner company and keep your phone put away in your pocket. Of
        course I had to take pics to share but next time I am fully tuning out.
        The service is a really nice pace, not too much checking in and a lot of
        time to enjoy your dishes. We went for the Chicago Restaurant Week
        specials and the menus and price point really blew us away. The decor is
        simple and cozy and the lighting was divinely dim. They had great little
        lamps on every table that assist with being able to see the menu without
        disrupting the ambiance.


        The one and only little negative thing I’ll say, and I’ll preface this
        by sharing that my husband is a professional chef of 20yrs and I’m a
        seasoned home cook- one dish we ordered tasted like butane so strongly
        that we couldn’t finish it. What may have happened is the flame torch
        had incomplete combustion, or if you don’t let the initial burst of gas
        burn off, you can ruin a dish. I was so excited to try the Richman
        Rainbow sushi dish and it was absolutely gorgeous when it arrived but we
        both took a piece and it completely tasted like butane. I tried a second
        piece to ensure it wasn't a fluke. I then put the dish up to my nose and
        it reeked. We left the dish alone and ate the other things that were
        coming to our table and when we gave our server the feedback it wasn’t
        well received. We were as nice as possible about it but did want to let
        them know that there was an issue. We didn’t want free food or a
        replacement, just to let them know that they may want to adjust their
        torch. Our server seemed to take it personally which is a shame. I
        unfortunately tasted butane in my mouth for the rest of the night no
        matter what I ate.


        But, truly, did not ruin our experience at all and we will eat here
        again. I would just be wary of any dish that highlights being torched in
        the future.


        The regular menu is extensive and we cannot wait to come back and try
        more! So happy we popped in.


        The pictures speak for themselves but I also shared the menus from the
        special week. And holy schnikeees the berry compote that came with the
        cheesecake was INSANE. Best I’ve ever had. The Tonkotsu Ramen was top
        tier, I will be craving that broth for days. Let’s keep this place open!
        A total treasure. I loved the wood and gold paneling details on the
        ceiling and walls.

        All the sushi is incredible. Postman and negi toro ate probably my top
        2!! The mighty mushroom is also so good (vegan) and wagyu beef bowl is
        really rich and buttery. Their chicken wing appetizer is bursting with
        flavor. Duck curry is nice and spicy with authentic thai flavors as
        well. Will be back!
