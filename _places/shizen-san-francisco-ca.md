        Shizen is hands-down one of the most impressive vegan restaurants Iâve
        ever been to â and quite possibly the best vegan sushi spot in San
        Francisco. From the moment you walk in, youâre greeted with a warm,
        stylish ambiance thatâs both modern and calming, perfect for an
        unforgettable dining experience.


        The menu is packed with creative, artfully crafted rolls that donât just
        mimic traditional sushi â they redefine it. I tried the candelstick,
        Ramen and  rolls, and both were mind-blowingly good. The flavor
        combinations, textures, and presentation were absolutely top-tier. Youâd
        never guess thereâs no seafood involved â everything is made from fresh
        vegetables, house-made sauces, and plant-based ingredients that shine in
        every bite.


        The service was equally fantastic â attentive, knowledgeable, and
        clearly passionate about the food. Yes, it can get busy (for good
        reason), but itâs worth every minute of the wait. Pro tip: get there
        early or join the waitlist online.


        Whether youâre vegan or not, Shizen is a must-visit. Itâs a bold,
        flavorful, and truly unique take on sushi that will leave you dreaming
        about your next visit. Highly recommended!

        Amazing food and service! We didn't have very high expectations from
        vegan sushi but this place definitely blew our mind. The sushis are so
        unique and perfect. The service is very quick. It is quite hard to find
        a table though but we were lucky to walk-in and find seats at the bar.

        THE BEST VEGAN SUSHI PLACE EVER!

        WOW this restaurant blew my mind. Who wouldâve thought Iâd get to enjoy
        Sushi being a vegetarian?

        All the dishes were top notch and service was incredible. Worth going on
        the Michelin guide.

        We ordered hidden agenda, secret weapon and boddy and soul. We also got
        the tofu starter. While it is hard to pick, secret weaponâs base made it
        so tasty. Hidden agendaâs garlic aoli combined with tempura eggplant was
        also great. I highly recommend vegans or even meat eaters to try out
        this place.

        The amount of Indian crowd whenever you go says it all!

        It was an amazing cozy spot. Since we did not have a reservation we were
        able to get a seat at the bar. Body and Soul roll was really great.

        Some of the veggies in the bar did not look fresh. Staff was very
        friendly and accommodating.

        Delicious food & sushi! I loved the Brussels sprouts, the candlestick
        roll was really fun (comes with a little flame on the plate), and the
        boddy & soul roll was so yummy! Attentive service. My one complaint is
        the tables were very close together; know itâs not a place for any kind
        of private conversation, and youâll be fine!
