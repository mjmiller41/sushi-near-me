        A Japanese teppanyaki dining place for quick bites. Hard to find a seat
        in the dining unit to eat in rainy days. The rice offered today was
        undercooked, which is absolutely unacceptable. Portion size is good for
        a meal.

        little overcooked and the eel sauce did not taste like eel sauce.
        Otherwise it was ok, very good fish , witch made the whole meal better
