        I got the AYCE for $35.95 on a Thursday night;

        Service was decent, not many workers but solemn.

        Roll was good, however, the sushi rice was kind of separated, tuna
        quality was decent but a little fishy, as was the halibut. My favorite
        was the unagi and albacore sushi, and the spicy tuna handroll(a lot of
        rice but a lot of tuna too so I guess it makes up for it).

        Definitely a go to restaurant for me and my partner that never has a
        wait. The food is always outstanding with the servers doing an amazing
        job if you do need to get a server you just click a button and they
        arrive! Definitely gives a mom pop type of restaurant. So if that’s your
        style you will definitely love this spot!

        Food: average, nothing exciting or horrible. Typical sushi but it was
        fresh and satisfying. Be aware that they give full rolls of sushi. I’ve
        been to some AYCE and they give a few pieces of your order, this is a
        full roll. We didn’t finish a roll and were charged an additional $5,
        understandable.


        Service: We waited about 10 minutes to receive our menus, another 25 to
        receive our food. We did the AYCE, so we put in one big order and didn’t
        have to order again. There were two waiters on duty. To give them
        credit, they cleared our table as needed.


        Atmosphere: definitely some sketchiness to the place, menus were sticky,
        table beside us was dirty when we arrived and never touched the whole
        time we were there. The place is in need of an upgrade.

        Pleasantly surprised by this small sushi place! They have an all you can
        eat sushi menu which is great. There were some hit and miss in what they
        have. The oysters were not that tasty and their hand rolls had more rice
        than fish which was a bit disappointing. However, they had some tasty
        sushi on their menu, like white tuna, red snapper, their salmon was like
        butter. This is definitely a place to come and try plus staff was so
        nice.

  Insights from Recent Reviews$$$Diners frequently highlight the all-you-can-eat
  sushi deals as a fun and satisfying way to sample a variety of fresh rolls,
  making it a solid pick for casual meals with friends or family. While some
  note that service can be prompt thanks to an easy ordering system, others
  mention occasional waits that are worth it for the tasty selections like unagi
  and spicy tuna. The atmosphere comes across as laid-back and unpretentious,
  ideal for those who appreciate a no-fuss spot for Japanese-inspired dishes
  close to home. Overall, the food quality shines through with fresh ingredients
  that keep people coming back, though a few suggest it's best for
  straightforward sushi cravings rather than fancy outings. If you're searching
  for reliable sushi places near you, this location often delivers a positive
  experience with generous portions at a moderate price.
