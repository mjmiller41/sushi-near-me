        Such a cozy atmosphere! The service was amazing. Our server was so kind
        and interacted wonderfully with kids. The prices were more than
        reasonable. The sushi was so tasty and so fresh. Highly recommended. I’m
        sorry I didn’t take more pictures 😭

        Such a cozy atmosphere! The service was amazing. Our server was so kind
        and interacted wonderfully with kids. The prices were more than
        reasonable. The sushi was so tasty and so fresh. Highly recommended. I’m
        sorry I didn’t take more pictures 😭

        Came here with my boyfriend for dinner at 7pm on a Friday. Sushi One had
        a decent amount of people sitting there eating. Immediately when we came
        in the waitress/hostess greeted us and sat us down. I need to make a
        recognition to this woman who I’m not sure is the owner/manager/regular
        employee but she was doing it ALL and with a smile/positive attitude!
        She was so funny too, very personable with customers including myself.
        She did not have a moment where she was standing there doing nothing.
        She was hostessing, waitressing and taking care of takeout orders! She
        is the reason I will return (aside from the food being delicious too). I
        have read other comments saying about the positive attitude and
        motivation this woman had in their experience as well. She also asked us
        if I had any allergies or preferences when we ordered our food.


        Wish I would’ve gotten her name, I encourage everyone to come visit!
        Food was delicious!!

        My husband and I have been coming here for years. We had twins last year
        and finally made our way back in yesterday with them, and they STILL
        remembered our order! Not only is their sushi incredible, but they are
        the kindest family. The server Lily is the best, the biggest ray of
        sunshine and makes you feel so welcome from the moment you walk in the
        door. Sushi One will forever be our go to sushi spot!!

        I’m not big on sushi but I really wanted hibachi so I thought I’d give
        Sushi One a try. I’m happy to report that I was not disappointed. The
        chicken hibachi was good with vibrant, fresh vegetables. The soup and
        salad sides were also tasty as was the bonus egg roll they also
        included!

        Visited Sushi One 🍣 for the first time but definitely not the last
        time. Our host Lynn greeted us warm and promptly. I was amazed to her
        fantastic memory and humor as she recalled my girlfriend visiting years
        ago. Now, let’s get to the good part.


        I’ve never experienced a sushi boat before and she took the time to
        cater it to our groups liking (more cooked than raw fish). In just a few
        minutes the boat came swimming down stream and did not disappoint!! We
        explored these delicacies one by one and topped it off with a perfect
        last bite. 🤩


        If you’re seeking great sushi, this is your place!! It’s a visit you
        won’t regret. 🏆🔥🔥🔥
