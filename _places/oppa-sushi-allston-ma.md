        The best sushi spot we have found near us. The fish is fresh especially
        the tuna which is my favorite but can be very hit or miss at other
        places. The appetizers are also great and the miso soup is delicious
        with plenty of flavor, tofu, and seaweed!


        Also, the people are kind and welcoming at the restaurant. There is good
        reason that Oppa has a great rating!

        I've tried almost every other sushi place around allston but I keep
        going back to oppa. Fresh fish and a great fish-to-rice ratio at a fair
        price. And the people who work there are all wonderful!


        Pictured are black dragon maki and allston maki (not exactly sure what's
        on it and the menu doesn't say, but it's tasty as heck).

        I rarely post reviews but this is a health issue. We were served a dish
        last night (a cooked/boiled soup) that had a blue elastic band still
        around the herbs. We didn't notice until we ate the leftovers the next
        day, at which point the soup had been heated twice.

        One of my favorite sushi places in the Allston area. It’s almost
        underground and they’ve recently expanded so it’s not tight and
        uncomfortable. Staff is always very friendly and it’s a great place to
        go as a group. You can try multiple rolls

        Without breaking the bank. Also, if you do go alone the rolls are
        reasonably priced as well.


        I’ve tried most of their menu and they never disappoint. Checkout the
        photos below and ask for the flaming sushi, it’s great for show!


        Fresh fish and hot sake = great time and happy bellies

        My friend and I came here looking for some Korean style sushi. While
        their menu was limited than I initially expected, we were able to find
        the spicy fish bowl soup which is a popular dish in Korea during the
        summer. The bowl came with an icy cold broth and vegetables that
        enhanced the refreshing aftertaste. The classic combination of thinly
        sliced squid and the sweet and spicy broth was nice, but the broth was
        too sweet for my taste. We also had the regular sushi and the scallop
        yaki, but both were unfortunately mediocre at best.


        Without AC, the restaurant was extremely hot and humid. The servers
        tried their best to provide us with a table closest to a fan, but it was
        pointless. Humidity and temperature are also critical factors in
        maintaining the quality of the sushi, so it was a bit concerning. We
        were also hugely disappointed when we found out that some items on the
        menu were more expensive than what was indicated. The fish bowl soup
        ended up being $10 more expensive, and we didn’t realize this until we
        got out. Although I would love to give a higher rating for their superb
        service, the overall experience wasn’t worth what I paid for.
