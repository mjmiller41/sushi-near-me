        This place became my favorite Japanese restaurant after the visit! The
        interior is pleasant! The staffs were friendly and attentive. We ordered
        the four courses, and each presentation was beautiful and each meal
        tasted delicious! What a wonderful night was!

        This restaurant might be the best of any I’ve ever been to in my life. 
        Certainly the best sushi.  The tuna was so fresh and everything just
        melted in your mouth.  The tuna tartare with basil sauce was something
        I’ve never even heard of but wow you have to try it.  The only thing
        better than that was the A5 wagyu.  I can’t even describe how good it
        is.  If you’ve never had it, it’s worth the price to try it.  The only
        thing we didn’t care for was the sauce for

        The fried chicken appetizer we got.  The chicken was perfectly fried in
        tempura batter and so flavorful.  The sauce was a lemony creamy
        something I don’t know, but it just wasn’t for us.  We got a side of eel
        sauce for it instead and that was perfect. The service was absolutely
        excellent and every person in the restaurant clearly cares about your
        experience and does an outstanding job.  Very classy and upscale
        restaurant.  This will be my absolute must come back to place in Dallas
        when we visit!!

        This has been one of the best experiences I’ve ever had at a restaurant
        and some of the best sushi ever!! Me, my husband and 8 month old wanted
        sushi to celebrate Eid and we walked in and asked for a table near the
        wall because we had a stroller with us and didn’t want to block any
        pathways - they did us one better and set us up in a private little room
        with a sliding door!! It was so special and unexpected and just plain
        nice that I almost started crying. The service was impeccable by
        everyone and they even gave me avocado for my baby to eat (which she
        LOVED). The sushi was so fresh and delicious. I’m so so so happy we
        chanced upon this place. Thank you for topping off a wonderful day.

        ebesu has been my favorite sushi spot for YEARS. i would 100% recommend
        trying this place out especially for their special rolls!!

        my favorites would have to be the yama hama roll, deluxe salmon and tuna
        rolls, and the crunch ell roll!!


        my friends and i actually have made a yearly tradition to come here to
        eat and celebrate eachothers’ birthdays because the food never
        disappoints. this restaurant needs more recognition for their amazing
        food.
