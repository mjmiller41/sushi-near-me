        close to it. It’s not exactly your traditional Japanese  experience but
        it’s a contemporary style, which is just as easy to enjoy. The staff was
        extremely friendly and helpful. I had a really great time. The drinks
        were excellent as well. They have the most perfect lychee martini I’ve
        ever had.

        The decor is absolutely wonderful. Just a beautiful space very well
        thought out all around from the dinner tables to the bathroom just very
        highly rated, luxury,  fancy all of those adjectives for this
        restaurant. The Omakasa experience here was in one word perfect or very
        close to it. It’s not exactly your traditional Japanese  experience but
        it’s a contemporary style, which is just as easy to enjoy. The staff was
        extremely friendly and helpful. I had a really great time. The drinks

        Shoto has quickly become my favorite sushi spot in DC now. Everything we
        tried on their menu was an absolute delight. Definitely more pricey than
        I’d like for a day to day meal, but this hot restaurant is great for
        special occasions. The interior decor and aesthetic is such a dream.


        We ate so many great things, but I’d absolutely recommend the tacos,
        sushi, and tempura rock shrimp. Also I definitely recommend getting sake
        for pairing with your meal.

        It was a nice Culinary Experience!

        The moment we stepped into Shoto, we knew we were in for something
        special. The ambiance perfectly balances luxury and warmth, with an
        attention to detail that immediately sets the tone for a refined dining
        experience.


        Every dish was a work of art — both visually and in flavor.


        Service was exceptional. Our server was knowledgeable and polite.
        However, since it was busy we had to wait for him couple times.


        Yes, it’s on the pricier side — but for the level of creativity,
        quality, and service you receive, it’s absolutely cost that amount of
        money.


        It's not you pay for food, you pay for the experience. So, be ready to
        spend good amount once you are there.


        It's not everyday place to eat but something you would enjoy on a
        special day.
