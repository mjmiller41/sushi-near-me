        Oops is one of my favorite sushi spots on the west side. They have the
        best happy hour deals, my favorite roll (the hot night) is only $12
        during HH! & they have happy hour prices all day Sunday! The spicy tuna
        bites are amazing & the shisito peppers are delicious. Highly recommend
        coming here!

        Strange name but delicious sushi. We stopped in yesterday for an
        unplanned Sunday dinner and we were both really impressed with Oops!
        It’s situated in the corner of a small strip mall in a quiet part of
        Sawtelle. Parking in the parking lot can be a bit tricky because the
        spaces are small and close together and it was completely full when we
        arrived for a 6 PM dinner but we were able to find neighborhood parking
        on the block next to the strip mall. We were seated right when we
        arrived and had a great dinner at the sushi bar. I was really impressed
        with all of the options on the menu and the pricing is very fair
        compared to other sushi spots close by.


        As always, we got a mix of items and shared everything. We started off
        with the Miso Soup, which is something I order all the time, next came
        the Softshell Crab, which was terrific. It wasn’t over fried and still
        had the great soft shell flavors and I would highly recommend ordering
        it. Next, we shared the Yellowtail Sampler, and it was a perfect amount
        with four pieces of yellowtail nigiri. Finally, we split three rolls:
        the Barrington, OMG, and Oops (I Did it Again). All three were really
        delicious, but our favorite was the OMG roll. It was packed with
        different fish, basically a new take on the Rainbow Roll.


        Everything was prepared with a lot of love and came out very quickly, so
        it’s the sort of place that you can dash in and out or stay a while with
        friends, family, or a date. It’s fairly small on the inside, but in a
        cozy way. Definitely will be back in the near future to try more items
        and would recommend to anyone else who is a sushi fan to do the same.

        This is a very hard post for me to make. I want to keep this place a
        secret but it really is to good to not share! I have been going here for
        over two years now and this is my favorite sushi restaurant in all of
        LA. The fish is so fresh the sauce is lite and the atmosphere (in my
        opinion) is perfect. I highly suggest this place! The lemon roll is
        where it’s at.

        Wow simply amazing!! My boyfriend and I came here for the first time and
        we were very satisfied. Out of all the places we've tried this is by far
        the best in town. The "lemon" roll was my favorite but all of the rolls
        were so yummy and fresh. The chef is very nice and very professional.
        Love the atmosphere  10/10 🍣

        The Baked Lobster Roll was amazing. We had three specialty rolls and
        three types of sushi and the garlic edamame. No complaints. Service was
        quick and friendly and everything came out as it was ready so it was all
        fresh! The yellowtail with the ginger/ponzu was also magical.  Would
        absolutely return!
