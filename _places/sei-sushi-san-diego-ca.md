        Amazing sushi and japanese food location!

        Right next to 24 Hour Fitness.

        This place has plenty of open parking, super friendly staff, amazing
        food and a very clean and inviting atmosphere.

        My girlfriend and I regular this spot it's just that good!

        Their menu is QR coded and they have options for all dietary needs.

        All the prices on food here are reasonable and affordable for the
        quality and amount of food you get!

        The staff here actually carried about your opinion and experience which
        isnt something you see every day.

        This spot earned a 3 Star rating, but the quality of the sushi, coupled
        with the fantastic service from Mika brought it up to a solid 4. The
        missing star is from no nigiri combo on the menu, coupled with no natto
        and prices that are above average. Will come back to see if owner really
        reads these and does something about it in the future….

        Food was delicious, everything had so much flavor and I think the
        edamame was honestly the best garlic edamame I've ever had! The staff
        were so incredibly friendly, and the restaurant was clean and had a
        welcoming environment. The wait for the food was a little on the long
        side, but everything else was absolutely perfect

        Nice sushi place that I've never noticed before! This place is close to
        my house and my roommate said she really enjoyed it so we decided to
        stop here quick before Christmas shopping. The service was pretty quick
        and it wasn't too crowded on a Wednesday night.

        We put in our order quick of the gyoza and Katsu bowl and they were out
        to us in less than 5 minutes. Both were Very tasty and hot!

        Gyoza were nice and savory with the sauce being just salty enough but
        not too much.

        The chicken katsu was very good, well breaded, moist, and the sauce was
        very, very delicious. She asked for extra to pour over her bowl to get
        down to the rice too.

        I've gotten the smokey tonkotsu ramen bowl and it's alright. The soup
        base of it seems a little off from typical tonkotsu ramens I have had.
        The chanshu seems to be cooked on a grill but I didn't really enjoy it.
        The texture wasn't the greatest. I'll probably stick to the katsu next
        time!

        I love sushi so I had to try this place out and I love the concept, it
        is super nice and comfortable to spend a nice evening with friends!

        Sushi is good in flavor, I like it very much, the only thing is that my
        flakes were not as crunchy as I like but besides that everything is
        great, nice service! 👀✨
