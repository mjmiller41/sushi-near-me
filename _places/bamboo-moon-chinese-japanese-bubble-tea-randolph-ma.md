        I can't rate on service or atmosphere because I got instacart delivery.
        But I can tell you everything was delicious! Crab rangoons, egg rolls,
        chicken fingers, general gao's Chicken, boneless spare ribs & fried
        rice. All of it was absolutely delicious!! Our new go-to Chinese food
        place! My son likes sushi so he will try that next. We both love pad
        Thai so we'll give that a go someday too!

        Before I give you any information you must know that my husband has a
        really bad stomach and what I mean by that is he knows before anybody
        else if the food is good or bad because of his stomach and the aches
        that he gets usually. We have a tradition that on Thanksgiving we
        usually buy Chinese food and in the last year the place that we usually
        have been going to was only mediocre at best. Knowing that a lot of
        places are closed this day we try to do our research and try to see what
        was open for Thanksgiving of 2024.

        From what it looks like on the outside it looks like a husband and wife
        team together doing the orders and making everything together.


        So because of the holiday I decided that it was best that I placed the
        order with giving them enough time to prepare the order. My order came
        to roughly $275 and so I gave them about 3 hours to prepare my order. I
        strongly think that we made the right choice because everything came out
        exactly the way that we had asked and requested. Even so much as the
        extra duck sauce was perfectly given.

        Me and my family of six can honestly say that this food was the best
        Chinese food that we have actually had in a long time everything was
        seasoned properly and didn't taste nasty what we usually expect from the
        place like this. It is located in Randolph and I believe that they used
        to use the Randolph sink water as a ways of cooking their rice and
        everything and you could definitely taste it on the food that's why I
        was so wary to begin with of ordering from this place. But they must
        have heard the news and definitely change their approach using filtered
        water instead. I can say that my husband does not have any stomach
        issues it is the next day usually by now we wouldn't see him for the
        next maybe day day and a half so that already is a good sign. And most
        of the food was pretty good. There were a few minor things that I
        personally would have liked differently but I guess every person is
        different.. I prefer my general gsoa chicken to be crispy yet glazed it
        is hard to achieve and I do understand that it is the holiday so they
        must be swamped. But they're run through the meal was pleasant. We will
        definitely be coming back thank you bamboo Moon for making our family
        have a great enjoyable meal.

        We did ordered Veg lo mein for takeout. I was bit unhappy to see noodles
        all dried up and white. It basically was bland. No side sauces were
        given.

        I got the volcano roll it was amazing, the flavor and the quality of the
        salmon was top tier out of all of the other sushi restaurants i have
        been to. The service was quick and top notch. The atmoshpere was
        delightful. All of the waiters were so kind and helpful when I didn't
        know what to order. I would 100% recommend this place for a lunch or
        dinner with your friends. I would come again.

        I'd say this is a decent restaurant. The drinks were not that great, but
        the food was awesome (coconut shrimp, fried rice). Staff was friendly.

        Definitely a go-to place when we need a quick asian meal.
