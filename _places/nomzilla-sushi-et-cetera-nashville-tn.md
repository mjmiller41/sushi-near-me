        I enjoyed my experience at Nomzilla. Their menu is original and
        creative. We visited for lunch and they had music playing. I will say
        the decor made me a lil nervous as it could use an upgrade. For example,
        many of the booths had material peeling. Don’t let that turn you away-
        the food and service were a hit. We have dumpling and egg rolls. The
        filling could have packed a bit more flavor but the crunch on both was
        INSANE. Extra cool points because they have a chicken roll. My husband
        has a seafood allergy which keeps me from enjoying sushi as often as I
        like - problem solved. Food was banging and we’ll be back. Lobster roll
        for the win

        I've been to this place more than once since it reopened.

        They have been nothing but nice and helpful on the dishes. They are
        generous with their portions.

        I'd recommend you try their sushi rolls, fried rice, and ramen at least
        once.

        I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. I absolutely love Nomzilla.
        Their revamped menu is amazing and they’ve even added back old
        favorites! The vegan ramen is so GOOD. It’s light and fresh, just like
        you’d expect from traditional ramen. They even offer gluten free noodles
        (which are just normal, friendly rice noodles)!!! Last night I had their
        fried rice which I literally could not stop eating. 😳 The staff is so
        nice and the place, overall is comfortable, cozy and clean. They use
        stainless steel chopsticks and sustainable to go boxes. Nomzilla has my
        heart. 💖🦖

        I’ve been coming here for 2+ years and while the ownership has recently
        changed, it’s still amazing. The new owners are long time friends of the
        previous owner, and they’ve worked together in the past. All of the
        recipes have been passed along with the sale and many favorites are
        still available. Initially the new menu didn’t catch my eye, but they
        listened to the feedback of their customers and added and denoted gluten
        free, vegetarian, and vegan options on the menu. I ate here the first
        week under new ownership and had some hesitations, but it’s clear they
        were just getting things off the ground and 6 months later I can attest
        that it’s just as great as it was before. The new owner was so friendly
        and excited to hear our feedback and really cares about what customers
        have to say. That being said, my one request is to bring back Thet’s
        Noodles :) love this place!

        Stopped here on a trip to Nashville. It was 8 PM and hard to find vegan
        options for my friends but we found Nomzilla and it was so delicious! I
        got the fried rice chicken katsu and it was 10/10. Friends got ramen and
        sushi. Would definitely recommend this place.
