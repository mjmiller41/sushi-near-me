        We went to this restaurant on a recommendation from the concierge at the
        hotel we were staying at, and it was within walking distance and there
        are a lot of other choices. The restaurant was packed on a Thursday
        night, but had a high-top table in the bar, so we went with that. Caleb
        our waiter/bartender, was super. He was professional and friendly and
        knew his stuff. So was the young man that brought out the food (forgot
        his name, picture included in the review). We ordered different drinks;
        I had the Hawaiian Margaritta (Just average) and then the Maui Sunset
        (Excellent), my wife had the White Linen and the Maui Sunset and loved
        both of them. The drinks were well done and looked impressive. We
        decided to order soups and appetizers for dinner. So we had a bowl of
        the Clam Chowder and the Lobster Bisque, and they were both excellent,
        tasted fresh and delicious. And we had an order of their award-winning
        Wing, the wings did not disappoint. They we had an order of Fried Ahi,
        Heavenly Roll, and Veggie Roll. The food looked and tasted very fresh
        and we enjoyed it all. I ordered a Hawaiian Bread Pudding, and that was
        just average, but I still enjoyed it. We will definitely come back.

        night, but had a high-top table in the bar, so we went with that. Caleb
        our waiter/bartender, was super. He was professional and friendly and
        knew his stuff. So was the young man that brought out the food (forgot
        his name, picture included in the review). We ordered different drinks;
        I had the Hawaiian Margaritta (Just average) and then the Maui Sunset
        (Excellent), my wife had the White Linen and the Maui Sunset and loved
        both of them. The drinks were well done and looked impressive. We
        decided to order soups and appetizers for dinner. So we had a bowl of
        the Clam Chowder and the Lobster Bisque, and they were both excellent,
        tasted fresh and delicious. And we had an order of their award-winning
        Wing, the wings did not disappoint. They we had an order of Fried Ahi,
        Heavenly Roll, and Veggie Roll. The food looked and tasted very fresh
        and we enjoyed it all. I ordered a Hawaiian Bread Pudding, and that was
        just average, but I still enjoyed it. We will definitely come back.

        My husband and I always eat here when we visit South Lake Tahoe. Shelby
        was our waitress this time and she was friendly and attentive. She was
        accommodating when requesting to sub a side for our steak.


        Food was great as always. We can’t wait to be back.

        The best meal we’ve had in a while! Laurita’s service was impeccable,
        the food came quickly and was cooked to perfection. We are foodies and
        honestly loved everything we got and had fun eating it. We got the mixed
        seafood, the poke nachos, the rack of lamb, and the Chilean sea bass. We
        didn’t lick the plates but it was hard…

        This was an incredible place for a nicer dinner out in South Lake. We
        had a group and they sat us no problem. The food and drinks were
        incredible. I started with the crab cakes and lobster bisque then had
        the shrimp lettuce wraps which all were fantastic. Highly recommend
        stopping in here for a nice meal.

        Walked in to grab a drink at the bar while we waited for our table next
        door; it turned out to be the perfect spot to spend the time.


        The vibe bordered on tacky but managed to keep it closer to the upscale
        side of the fence, with a tropical Hawaiian theme. The cocktail list was
        extensive and impressive; the service at the bar was professional and
        quick.


        The front staff did seem a bit green; midway through talking to the
        hostess, a waitress interrupted us to speak directly with her without
        any sort of acknowledgement that she was interrupting. It wasn’t a huge
        deal but felt a bit unprofessional — they seemed like high schoolers
        working a summer job (again, not a huge deal, but it would’ve been a red
        flag had we been dining for dinner).


        Would definitely come back for a drink while enjoying an evening in
        Heavenly village.
