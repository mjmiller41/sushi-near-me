        Yikes.  I usually only write reviews that are for good places, but for
        once, I was compelled to write this one for the opposite reason.  I
        should've been skeptical when I noticed this was the only sushi place in
        the area, which may be why it received all these wonderful reviews.


        I've had bad sushi experiences before, but this was next level.  The
        exterior of the restaurant should have indicated that this was not going
        to be a quality experience.  And the interior was even worse.  Chinese
        restaurant?  This would've still been pretty bad for that standard, but
        for a Japanese place, unacceptable.  Incredibly dingy and unwelcoming.


        Then came the food.  The order was taken by what I assume to be the
        owner or co-owner.  Perfectly pleasant lady, and after she took the
        order, she went behind the sushi counter to make it herself.  Still ok
        by my book. Mom and pop restaurants are many times the best.  We ordered
        a chirashi and a cold soba noodle.


        Chirashi is a bowl of seasoned sushi rice with various ingredients
        scattered on top, typically various slices of sashimi and perhaps some
        other things like vegetables or egg. No seaweed, typically.  Well, I
        watched as she place a fairly large mound of sushi rice in a sushi boat,
        placed squares of seaweed directly on the mound of rice, placed the fish
        all around it, topped it with a piece of cooked eel...and then proceeded
        to pour vast amounts of unagi sauce (a dark, thick sweet sauce) over the
        WHOLE thing, eel and all.  You can see the pools of it in the boat in
        the photo. I was curious at first, then mortified. Of course when I
        finally ate it, all I had was mouthfuls of sauce that had perfectly
        covered up and destroyed the taste of the raw fish.  When I did manage
        to take bites of the fish without the sauce, the fish was decent.  The
        sushi rice, not so much, but I realized I had just been introduced to a
        new dish: chirashi teriyaki.  Never again.


        The soba noodles were decent, but the dipping broth was so salty, we had
        to dilute it with water.  Not exactly traditional either.


        Service was fine, I can't knock that. But unless you are hankering for a
        memorable sushi experience (and not in a good way), I'd avoid!

        Yikes.  I usually only write reviews that are for good places, but for
        once, I was compelled to write this one for the opposite reason.  I
        should've been skeptical when I noticed this was the only sushi place in
        the area, which may be why it received all these wonderful reviews.


        I've had bad sushi experiences before, but this was next level.  The
        exterior of the restaurant should have indicated that this was not going
        to be a quality experience.  And the interior was even worse.  Chinese
        restaurant?  This would've still been pretty bad for that standard, but
        for a Japanese place, unacceptable.  Incredibly dingy and unwelcoming.


        Then came the food.  The order was taken by what I assume to be the
        owner or co-owner.  Perfectly pleasant lady, and after she took the
        order, she went behind the sushi counter to make it herself.  Still ok
        by my book. Mom and pop restaurants are many times the best.  We ordered
        a chirashi and a cold soba noodle.

        We ended up here by accident,  and so glad we did. This is a family
        owned place and had excellent service!

        We ordered miso soup, had plenty of tofu! California roll, wonton soup
        which were both large portions and tasted delicious! Now, I truly loved
        my yellow tail sushi, super fresh and full of flavor. And ... spicy
        yellow tail roll and spider roll were just amazing! Everything was fresh
        and satisfying 😌


        We were so glad we ended up here by accident! Our dinner couldn't have
        been any better!

        Sadly, our vacation ends tomorrow but will definitely bookmark it for
        our next visit

        Delicious, fresh food and a warm, homey atmosphere! My family was
        looking for some noodles and soup to warm us up, and New Tokyo did not
        disappoint in the slightest. We ordered:

        • pork cutlet - it was big but cut nice and thin for ease of dipping
        into sauce

        • ramen with BBQ pork - a solid bowl of soup noodles that was just the
        right size

        • butter and corn ramen - personally as a corn fan, this hits the spot!!

        • katsudon - the sauce was so good, and the chicken was very tender.

        • tempura udon (Not pictured) - one of the best tempura I've had in a
        while. It wasn't too oily, and it was still light and fresh. Definitely
        a work of art ♡

        • sashimi platter - each cut of seafood was fresh and delicious

        For those lovers of hole-in-the-wall mom-and-pop shops, New Tokyo is the
        epitome of that out here in the heart of Marina.


        P.S. wish I tried the chirashi 🥹
