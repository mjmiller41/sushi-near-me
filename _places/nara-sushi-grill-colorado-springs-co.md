        Nara is extremely underrated. I don’t know why this place isn’t packed
        every night. Their ingredients are super fresh and the sushi is
        incredible (just look at the pictures). Nara makes that fancy sushi
        place in downtown springs look like Long John Silvers.

        A Local Gem – The Best Sushi, Amazing People


        Nara Sushi & Grill is hands down one of our favorite restaurants—my wife
        and I have been going there for years, and it never disappoints. The
        sushi is consistently excellent—fresh, beautifully prepared, and
        absolutely delicious. The service is equally outstanding—always warm,
        attentive, and genuine.


        What truly sets Nara apart, though, are the owners, Jae and Kim. They
        are among the most hardworking, dedicated people I’ve ever met. Despite
        enduring major setbacks, including a devastating fire in a neighboring
        business and the challenges of COVID, they’ve continued to pour their
        hearts into offering the best sushi and Asian entrées in town.


        Please understand that great sushi takes time—perfection can’t be
        rushed. The quality and care behind every dish is absolutely worth the
        wait.


        If you’re lucky enough to get to know Jae and Kim, you’ll be as blessed
        as we are. Nara Sushi & Grill is not just a restaurant—it’s a place
        built on passion, resilience, and love for the craft. Highly, highly
        recommend!

        This is a great neighborhood sushi spot. When we went, someone was
        having a birthday and they brought out a ridiculously cool sushi boat
        for them, complete with moving parts 😂


        Service for us was really prompt - we were seated right away and we
        don’t remember the food taking a long time in any sense of the word.


        We ordered 2 nigiri- salmon and tuna and 2 rolls and a seaweed salad.
        The seaweed salad was presented really lovely with flowers and a small
        salad underneath. Strong sesame flavor- I’d recommend this!


        The salmon nigiri was good flavor and texture. My dining partner liked
        the tuna nigiri but I couldn’t get into it - maybe it was just me.


        Crazy spicy was the best roll. It’s deep fried and not really sushi but
        it was really really tasty 😂 like really.


        The dragon roll was good but simply had too much - this is a 2 bite
        roll!


        The specials all looked good especially the red snapper- we might get
        that when we come back.
