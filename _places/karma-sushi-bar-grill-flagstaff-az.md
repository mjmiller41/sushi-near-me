        We stopped by Karma Sushi Bar Grill in Flagstaff and overall had a good
        experience.


        We ordered the Karma and Instant Karma sushi rolls, along with the
        lobster tempura bites from their specials menu. The lobster bites were
        tasty but were mostly breading, especially for the $18 price point. The
        ramen was good, but the noodles were a little different than what we
        expected. As for the sushi, the flavors were good but the rice was a bit
        mushy this time around.


        That said, the service was great. Thomas did an excellent job letting us
        know that the sushi bar was a bit backed up, so we really appreciated
        the communication. They brought out our ramen first, and about 15
        minutes later our sushi and appetizer arrived.


        We’ve been to Karma before and have had great experiences, so it seems
        like they were just extra busy this time. We’ll definitely be back

        A great sushi place, lots of Japanese whiskey choices.


        Went during Happy Hour, great deals. I got a Hot Toddy, it was not on
        the menu but the bartender whipped it up no problem.


        Very clean, great service.

        Wonderful atmosphere, the ramen noodles in the ramen were absolutely
        delicious. There weren’t too many toppings which is oddly satisfying
        because you can really focus on the broth and noodles. A bit expensive
        but I think the atmosphere makes up for it.


        Probably would only go during happy hour though, just for the sake of
        prices :)

        I wish we lived here because I want to try so many more rolls!!  We were
        heading for pizza and found this first and definitely we think we made
        the right decision.  We started with the special, I just know it had
        mangos and was very good.  We then went for the Red Dragon and Kaptain
        Krunch rolls.  Just watching the rolls going to different tables was
        fun, they definitely win for presentation.

        Dinner at Karma did not disappoint and service was impeccable. We both
        had the Ahi Tataki Tower and shared a Rainbow roll. The sushi was
        incredible. Highly recommend!
