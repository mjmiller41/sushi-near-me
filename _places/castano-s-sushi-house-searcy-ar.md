        I'm always looking for new places to eat. I love sushi and love going to
        Searcy. Castano's is a must visit if you love sushi. Bring your appetite
        because the portions are not small. The food was fantastic and would
        have you coming back for more. I've had a few raw sushi rolls, but the
        Fish Killer is hands down the best I've so far. I didn't count all the
        different rolls that they have, but I'm pretty sure it's over 50+
        different rolls. So if you love sushi and your in/visiting Searcy, AR
        swing by Castano's Sushi House. As another reviewer said of Castano's,
        it is a bit chilly. So if you get cold easily like my wife does, bring a
        jacket or sweater.

        Let me start by saying OUT with the old restaurant and IN with this new
        one! Wow! We were hesitant to try this since it was in the same
        establishment as the old sushi place. I’m glad my husband and I went in
        and gave it a go. My husband and I have eaten at many sushi restaurants
        around the US and this one is top three for us! Their portions are
        wonderful, the sushi is creative, fun, and beautifully crafted. The rice
        was wonderful and the crab ragoons were like dessert, so good! It may be
        a bit pricier than some of the other restaurants but it is worth it to
        us to have QUALITY sushi. This is our new go to Sushi place in the area.
        Wonderful job and please keep up the amazing food and quality you’ve
        started out with.

        I just had another awesome meal at Castano's Sushi House, and I’m still
        smiling! I always get the Godzilla Roll, and let me tell you, it never
        disappoints. Seriously, it’s a flavor explosion every single time!


        The mix of fresh ingredients and that perfect presentation? So good! The
        vibe is chill, and the staff are super friendly, making the whole
        experience even better. If you’re in the mood for sushi, you have to try
        the Godzilla Roll. (It's cold in here, so bring a sweater!) I can’t
        recommend it enough! Can’t wait for my next visit!🍣😊

        I just moved here from Chicago and was sad about giving up good sushi. I
        found out this place opened up four months ago and had to give it a try.
        I always get Philadelphia roll the first time I eat at a sushi place as
        a baseline to compare the sushi places.

        The roll had the freshest, avocado, and salmon I’ve had in a while. The
        inside of the roll is loaded up more than any sushi place I’ve been.

        The servers are so attentive here.

        Good pricing. Nice interior with good amount of seating.


        What a relief to know that there is a delicious sushi place here. I will
        definitely be coming here weekly.
