        We went last night for my birthday because this place has high reviews
        and it lived up to the reviews. We had a great meal. We got the love
        boat and chicken fried rice. The sushi was fresh and delicious and the
        chicken fried rice comes with a lot of chicken. My wife and I also like
        a good bowl of ramen so we will have to go back soon and try the ramen
        here.  Because it was my birthday there were also a few birthday extras.

        We’ve been here for the 4th time. We love their Alaska Roll and Ramen. I
        like their new set of chairs and tables. I wish nothing but the best for
        this place. This restaurant deserves to be popular because the food is
        delicious. We would keep coming back here.

        Today was the third time my wife and I have dined here, and it
        definitely won’t be the last! We discovered this gem just 3 weeks ago!
        We love coming back because the food and the experience are consistently
        excellent. Every visit has been great, and as a bonus, we’ve received
        complimentary appetizers each time—which is such a nice touch.


        This time, we ordered the Crunchy Roll, Spicy Girl, and Shaggy Dog, and
        as always, they did not disappoint. The Spicy Girl roll is loaded with
        spicy tuna—absolutely delicious!


        The staff here are always friendly and welcoming, and the restaurant
        itself is spotless and well-maintained. We really appreciate the
        attention to detail in both the service and the atmosphere.


        Highly recommend this place if you’re looking for great food and a great
        experience!

        Miyazaki Sushi and Ramen is hands down our go-to spot as a family — and
        for good reason! The food is always fresh and absolutely delicious.
        Whether it’s sushi, ramen, or anything in between, every bite hits the
        mark. The customer service is truly top-notch. The staff is warm,
        welcoming, and goes above and beyond to make every visit special.


        We eat here often because everyone in the family loves it, and it never
        disappoints. Most recently, during a dinner to celebrate my birthday, my
        mother-in-law casually mentioned the occasion to our server. What
        happened next was beyond thoughtful — the staff went all out to make my
        birthday feel extra special. It turned into a night I’ll never forget
        and added a beautiful new memory to our favorite sushi place.


        If you’re looking for incredible food and heartfelt service, Miyazaki is
        it!
