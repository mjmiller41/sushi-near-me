        I live in San Diego, and anytime I’m working in LA I try to make it
        here.  It’s a no frills, come as you are joint which I love.  No music
        blaring so can actually have a conversation with the people you are
        dining with.

        The food is great, the prices are great, as is the service.  I’ve never
        had a bad experience in the dozen or so times I’ve been there, and
        ALWAYS leave happy and full

        I’m getting hungry just looking at the pictures I posted, and can’t wait
        for my next trip.  I highly recommend AYCE Sushi and BBQ!

        Heard so many great reviews about this spot, so we had to check it out
        for ourselves.


        Parking: Welcome to LA where the parking sucks a—. There are metered
        street parking. I parked a block away and just walked there.


        Ambiance/Environment: We came a little past 7pm, and this place was
        poppin! It was sooo busy. There’s plenty of indoor seating and some
        outdoor seating. Outdoor seating has heaters.


        Service: The workers were quick & efficient! There was a wait, but we
        only waited about 10 min, considering it was pretty busy. If you walk in
        through the front, walk to the back to partner with a server. They’ll
        place you on a waitlist and hand you a ticket then call you when your
        table is ready. Or you can dm them via their IG page to join the
        waitlist. They’re really responsive!


        Food & drinks: I looove that this spot offers AYCE sushi AND kbbq at an
        affordable price! The quality does reflect its prices. The meats and
        sushi were really good! I enjoyed their salmon and brisket. The sides
        were okay, and you can always order more. They offer a lot of alcoholic
        beverages also at an affordable price! We ordered Tiger Beers, and it
        paired perfectly with everything we ate.


        Pricing: AYCE for $25, soju for $8.95, and beers for $4?! Can’t beat
        these prices, especially in LA! I definitely got greedy and ordered more
        than I should’ve lol. My bf and I left overly fulfilled & satisfied!
