        I can’t say enough great things about Modesto Sukiyaki! This place has
        quickly become my new favorite spot—10/10! A coworker recommended it to
        me, and it absolutely did not disappoint.


        The sushi was fresh and flavorful, with beautiful presentation. The
        ramen was rich and comforting, with a perfect balance of flavors. The
        chicken katsu was crispy, juicy, and perfectly seasoned—truly one of the
        best I’ve had.


        The service was equally amazing—attentive, friendly, and fast. The staff
        made the whole experience so enjoyable.


        If you’re looking for incredible food and outstanding service, I highly
        recommend checking this place out. I’ll definitely be coming back again
        and again! And we were treated to this amazing dessert!

        great, and aesthetic even better. Felt like I could sit and chat for
        hours there! All of the dishes I sampled tonight were fantastic and I
        hope to come back again.

        Upon entering Modesto Sukiyaki, the ambiance struck a delightful balance
        between elegance and comfort, thanks to its dark theme accented with
        soft lighting. The welcoming smile from the staff added a touch of
        warmth, although the chill in the air was noticeable. Despite being
        winter, the restaurant's AC seemed to be in full swing, a small note for
        future visits to bring along a jacket.


        The restaurant, cozy in size, had an intimate atmosphere that was
        unexpectedly quiet for an early evening, with just a few patrons besides
        us. Its smallness contributed to a more personalized and relaxed dining
        experience. I was immediately drawn to the vibrant neon sign
        highlighting the day's specials - an array of tempting choices like
        tempura soft shell crab and blue fin o-toro. However, my sushi craving
        was insatiable. We started our culinary journey with some classic saki
        bomb drinks, accompanied by the comforting warmth of miso soup and the
        delightful crunch of gyoza.


        For our main course, we chose the Crazy Tuna Roll and the Volcano Roll.
        Each roll was a masterpiece of flavor and texture. The Crazy Tuna Roll,
        with its spicy tuna and crispy asparagus, offered a satisfying crunch in
        every bite, while the Volcano Roll was an explosion of tastes, combining
        the heat of jalapeño with the richness of cream cheese, topped off with
        eel and crazy sauce. It was a delightful balance of spicy, creamy, and
        crunchy elements, making the Volcano Roll particularly memorable.


        What surprised me the most was the affordability of our meal. Despite
        the high quality and generous portions of the sushi, our total bill was
        under $60, making Modesto Sukiyaki not just a culinary delight but also
        a budget-friendly option. This restaurant proved to be a fantastic
        choice, offering a cozy atmosphere, delicious food, and prices that
        leave you pleasantly surprised. It's a spot I'd gladly recommend to
        anyone in Modesto looking for a great sushi experience without breaking
        the bank.
