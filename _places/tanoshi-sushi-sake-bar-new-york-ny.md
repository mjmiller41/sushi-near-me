        This was the worst sushi experience I’ve ever had. The rice was entirely
        unsuitable for sushi – it lacked the light, fluffy texture and didn’t
        gently fall apart in the mouth. Instead, it was dense, sticky, and felt
        more like a large lump of rice or mochi. Despite using good-quality
        fish, the sushi itself was tasteless and poorly made, far worse than
        even grocery store sushi.


        The sushi chef seemed inexperienced in traditional omakase preparation.
        I was particularly surprised by how the sushi was presented without any
        thought or care for direction, something I’ve never seen at an omakase
        restaurant before. Additionally, hygiene was concerning, as the chef
        used the same gloved hands to handle sushi and touch various items
        around the kitchen. It made for a very unpleasant experience, to the
        point where I wanted to leave halfway through.


        While the fish itself was decent, the poor execution of the sushi
        overshadowed everything else. Considering the restaurant’s previously
        strong reputation, it’s clear that something has changed – likely a
        shift in management or ownership. Unfortunately, this once-celebrated
        establishment no longer meets its past standards.

        This was the worst sushi experience I’ve ever had. The rice was entirely
        unsuitable for sushi – it lacked the light, fluffy texture and didn’t
        gently fall apart in the mouth. Instead, it was dense, sticky, and felt
        more like a large lump of rice or mochi. Despite using good-quality
        fish, the sushi itself was tasteless and poorly made, far worse than
        even grocery store sushi.


        The sushi chef seemed inexperienced in traditional omakase preparation.
        I was particularly surprised by how the sushi was presented without any
        thought or care for direction, something I’ve never seen at an omakase
        restaurant before. Additionally, hygiene was concerning, as the chef
        used the same gloved hands to handle sushi and touch various items
        around the kitchen. It made for a very unpleasant experience, to the
        point where I wanted to leave halfway through.

        Every piece was a delicacy, thank you for the omakase experience! I
        loved the fact that the sole focus was on the food itself - not on the
        decoration, etc. - and that it’s BYOB. The environment was also very
        relaxed. Highly recommend!

        If you’re looking for an authentic omakase experience, look no
        further—this place is the real deal. Every piece of sushi was a
        masterpiece, with the kind of precision and freshness that makes you
        momentarily forget every other meal you’ve ever had. Chef Tomoki
        elevated the entire experience, not just with his incredible skill, but
        with his humor and personality. He had us laughing between bites of
        perfectly crafted sushi, making the meal feel both intimate and
        unforgettable.


        From the melt-in-your-mouth fish to the perfectly seasoned rice, every
        course was a journey of flavors. If you appreciate true Japanese
        craftsmanship this is the omakase spot for you. Can’t wait to come back!

        We visited Tanoshi Sushi Sake Bar mainly because of their stellar
        reviews, and I truly wish I could add another five stars here because
        their food absolutely deserves it. Lazarus, our Hispanic sushi chef, has
        completely embraced his role and delivered an incredible dining
        experience. He was even somewhat of a "Soup Nazi" — berating my wife for
        putting a slice of ginger on one of the dishes. I respect their
        traditionalism and dedication to detail, and the results were undeniably
        scrumptious.


        However, I am deducting stars for a few reasons:


        1. The Chairs: The seating is downright uncomfortable—cheap, swiveling
        bar stools with no back support. For the kind of dining experience
        they’re aiming to offer, this simply doesn’t cut it.


        2. Ambiance and Price: The restaurant feels about 20-30% too expensive
        for the overall experience. While the sushi itself is unforgettable, the
        setting doesn’t match the price point. Investing in better chairs and
        upgrading the decor could elevate the atmosphere to match the quality of
        the food.


        I’m rooting for this place and genuinely hope they make some changes
        because their sushi is exceptional. With a few adjustments, they have
        the potential to create a dining experience as memorable as their
        dishes.

        The worst omakase experience I’ve ever had.

        I came in for lunch and ordered the $60, 6 piece set. Every piece of
        fish tasted watery, mushy, and completely lacked flavor some even had a
        bad smell. It was clear the fish was not fresh at all. I left feeling
        really disappointed and honestly a bit sick.


        What’s worse, it’s very obvious that this restaurant doesn’t care about
        their customers they just want to get rid of old, unfresh fish and make
        a quick buck. The main chef didn’t seem to care at all about what he was
        making. He was chatting with his coworkers the entire time, totally
        checked out. I couldn’t help but wonder did he even think about what he
        was serving?


        I walked in because of the good Google reviews, but I want to warn
        others: don’t let the ratings fool you. This meal ruined my whole day.
        Be careful before you waste your time and money here.
