        The atmosphere was not the best. It's very aged, and the building has
        strong, not-so-pleasant smells. The selection of food was limited. The
        items we ordered did taste ok, but not great. Not alot of protein in the
        pho. The location is convenient, right next to the highway.

        This Pho restaurant used to be my favorite spot. I live in Mansfield,
        and I would always make the drive because I absolutely loved their broth
        – it had this amazing coconut flavor that made it the best Pho I’d ever
        had. Unfortunately, after my most recent visit, I won’t be coming back.
        While enjoying my shrimp Pho, I noticed something brown floating on top.
        When I flipped it over with my spoon, I was horrified to discover it was
        a roach. I had already eaten half of my Pho, and I was incredibly
        disappointed and disgusted. I can’t return after that experience.

        The food was so good, I had lunch with my sister and we were both
        impressed with the food!!! I had the small beef pho and my daughter had
        the shrimp spring rolls. I didn’t take a picture of my pho because I
        scarfed it down, it was that good! My daughter is young and doesn’t know
        how to use chop sticks and they have kids chop sticks! I loved how
        ingenious their kids chopsticks are. I will come back with my family so
        they can taste the delicious food.

        Was craving some good Pho and went over to this place as it was the
        nearest one from where I live.  And trust me the food here didn’t
        disappoint. We ordered Veg Tempura Roll, Veg Pho and Veg fried rice.
        Since it was-not mentioned on the menu, we didn’t have any idea that
        their fried rice comes with egg. They were kind enough to exchange it
        later on. The taste overall of every food was top notch. The broth of
        Veg pho was very good surprisingly.

        I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good pho
        and sushi place. ❤️

        Visited this place after a coworker's suggestion. This is easily one of
        my top places for pho. Do yourself a favor and ask for the spicy beef
        broth instead of the regular broth.....GAME CHANGER. The meat didn't
        have tons of fat and was flavorful. Generous amount of noodles. I got
        the medium and barely finished it.  My co-workers both got something
        different and they were also pleased. Tempura shrimp sushi was good for
        an appetizer.
