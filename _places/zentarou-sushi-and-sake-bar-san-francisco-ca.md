        Zentarou Sushi in the Inner Sunset is a gem! Their menu is exciting and
        stands out from other sushi spots, offering a variety of options,
        including two types of Omakase. We went with the more affordable Omakase
        option, which still delivered an incredible experience with two sets of
        five pieces of Nigiri, a flavorful fish bone broth, and the option to
        add a $30 upgrade. The upgrade was totally worth it, including A5 Wagyu,
        uni from Hokkaido, and Otoro—absolutely delicious!


        We also tried some side dishes, and they exceeded expectations. The
        portions were surprisingly generous for the price, like the grilled
        yellowtail collar for just $16 and the soft-shell crab for $15. Both
        were flavorful and satisfying.


        The service was fantastic! Our server was friendly, attentive, and made
        the whole experience enjoyable. Zentarou Sushi is definitely a place
        we’ll be coming back to for great food, generous portions, and amazing
        service. Highly recommend!

        Zentarou Sushi in the Inner Sunset is a gem! Their menu is exciting and
        stands out from other sushi spots, offering a variety of options,
        including two types of Omakase. We went with the more affordable Omakase
        option, which still delivered an incredible experience with two sets of
        five pieces of Nigiri, a flavorful fish bone broth, and the option to
        add a $30 upgrade. The upgrade was totally worth it, including A5 Wagyu,
        uni from Hokkaido, and Otoro—absolutely delicious!


        We also tried some side dishes, and they exceeded expectations. The
        portions were surprisingly generous for the price, like the grilled
        yellowtail collar for just $16 and the soft-shell crab for $15. Both
        were flavorful and satisfying.

        I really wanted to love Zentarou, but unfortunately, it missed the mark
        for me and my partner. We visited during Valentine's weekend (though not
        on the actual day) and opted for the Valentine's omakase special (which
        seemed to be the equivalent of their premium omakase, but dressed up for
        the occasion). At $280 for two people, we had high expectations but felt
        that the quality and service didn’t quite justify the price.


        Our favorites were the Miyazaki A5 wagyu, Otoro, and Hokkaido uni. These
        were included in the Valentine's special (and also appear to be part of
        the premium omakase set on a regular night). For the regular omakase,
        these items are available as supplements. The second round of nigiri was
        probably the best part of the meal.


        However, beyond those highlights, the rest of the experience fell short.
        The rice ratio and flavor on the first round of nigiri were
        inconsistent, and the hamachi tasted slightly overcooked. When asked
        about allergies and food restrictions, I specifically requested no
        cucumber, yet the first dish included it. The eggplant in that same dish
        was also tougher than expected. While we tried to keep an open mind, we
        couldn’t help but feel that the overall quality didn’t match the price
        tag.


        That said, we appreciated the presentation of the dishes and the effort
        of the team. While the staff was friendly, they seemed a bit rushed
        (likely due to the busy weekend), which made the service feel less
        personal than we had hoped for. Perhaps it was just an off night due to
        the occasion, but given our experience, we’d be hesitant to return. At
        this price point, I believe there are better omakase experiences to be
        found.

        I've been to a good chunk of high-end sushi places in SF (Robin,
        Kusakabe, Ju-Ni, etc.) but Zentarou is the best place for sushi and
        omakase in the city. I think this place is still under the radar as they
        only opened last year, but it could easily have a Michelin star. Every
        single piece on their premium omakase menu was superb. Each fish was of
        the highest quality, and carefully crafted with complimentary seasoning,
        garnish, and temperature. The menu came with appetizers and hot food as
        well, which were equally beautifully and deliciously prepared. I
        appreciated that they specified the region each fish was from, and that
        they integrated local fresh fish selections into the nigiri rotation.
        For salmon lovers, adding on the salmon tasting is a must. Their sake
        selection is also extensive, and our waiter did a fantastic job of
        recommending a bottle for us and giving us samples to hone in on it
        given our taste preferences. 10/10

        I had the supreme omakase, oysters, tempura, salmon collar and the
        lychee sherbet.

        The sushi was decent, it was good but nothing special. The wasabi was a
        bit too much on the nigiri.


        For the most part everything was not bad, but the toro and truffle
        nigiri was way too chewy and I couldn’t eat it.


        The salmon collar was a little bland, but the desserts were delicious!!

        While working in San Francisco, I stopped off for dinner on a friend's
        recommendation and I'm so glad I did.


        The food, staff, and atmosphere were all amazing.


        The 12 piece sashimi, Kisetsu, and scallops were all delicious. The Uni
        is imported from Hokkaido, Japan and was so fresh and sweet after every
        bite. My taste buds thought I was back in Japan again.


        I found my new favorite sushi restaurant!
