        Great value for great food! We ordered a 2 and 3 combo meal with 2
        karaage, 2 rolls, and vegetable tempura and we had plenty of leftovers
        with just 2 ppl eating! I recommend their karaage, sesame chicken, and
        the Philly roll! The owners are very friendly and we thought the food
        was delicious! I used to go here as a kid, 20 years ago, so I’m glad to
        see Rice Things is still around

        Our family has eaten here since the early 2000s and this was one of our
        go-to locations for cheap and delicious food. We haven’t been here since
        2019 but it seems like the taste/texture has dropped :(


        Food/Taste/Flavor: 3/5 - we ordered 2 combo plate and a sushi roll. The
        pork and chicken katsu were pretty dry and the sauce was fairly salty.
        The vegetable tempura surprised me since it’s much more American
        ingredients than Japanese and included items such as carrots and green
        bean (imagine my shock and disappointment when I bit what I thought was
        a sweet potato…. but it was a carrot?!?! T_T). Recommendation to ask if
        you can get the sauce on the side for chicken teriyaki since it’s a bit
        sweet. The chicken karaage (fried chicken) was delicious and juicy when
        we first opened the box but became hard fairly quick as the food cooled.
        The salmon avocado roll was really good with lots of salmon! The South
        Bay Firecracker Roll had a nice kick but we probably wouldn’t get again
        since it really is just spicy tuna on a California roll with some
        spiciness on top. There's not much alvocado in the either of the rolls
        and they were a bit wonky. Wasabi doesn't have any kick.


        Ambience: 3/5 - took the food to go. The restaurant only has 3-4 tables
        to eat at and one of the walls was just stacked with boxes. Looks like
        some remodel or design has changed in the past few years


        Service: 5/5 - cashier was extremely friendly and let us take our time
        to make our order. Her quoted time of about 15 min was on point!


        Value for price: 4/5 - this place has increased in prices but it’s still
        very reasonable and one of the cheaper locations. Unfortunately, the
        quality/taste/texture has dropped

        Great little place, guys there are friendly and welcoming, wings were
        delicious, rolls also were good just wish portions were a tad bit bigger
        my only suggestion the rolls with the jalapeno is if the jalapeno were
        slightly roasted just to soften then up then put on top of the roll that
        would be a game changer🤤🤤🤤🤤 but over all place is a "repeat 👍" for
        us.

        Amazing Japanese food for fair prices. The quality and portions are
        worth every penny. And it's so good I'd carry bags of pennies to pay
        every time if I had to.
