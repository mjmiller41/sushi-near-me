        This sushi restaurant has been on my list forever.  I always pass it
        headed to/fro Frenchman at off times of the night.  Could not pass up
        birthday dinner invite.  They mackerel so I was happy.  They tried and
        enjoyed my salmon skin, gave them ideas of what to do with leftovers at
        home.  The twister roll was good as well.  The miso soup was decent,
        didn't try the hello kitty, but it was the table's favorite.  California
        and spicy tuna were good, and most of us liked the spicy tonkatsu
        ramen.  I tried to not go crazy, we ordered for the table.  The mackerel
        was up to par, so I was satisfied.  The ramen was a surprise, I'd order
        that for myself.  I'll have to make more of an effort to return.

        This restaurant was hands down the highlight of my trip and the perfect
        spot for a memorable date night. Every dish exceeded expectations, but
        the spicy edamame was by far my favorite. The flavor was the perfect
        balance of spicy and garlicky, simply outstanding. The service was
        exceptional, showing a genuine care for their customers and a dedication
        to perfecting every dish. The fish was incredibly fresh and delicious,
        and I loved that they offered ponzu sauce, which is my absolute
        favorite. The martini was perfectly crafted, with amazing flavor, and
        the yellowtail jalapeño was both beautiful and packed with flavor. Every
        single dish was divine, and I will definitely be returning just for the
        spicy edamame. 10/10 – an unforgettable dinner experience!

        Low key sushi spot! Service , drinks , food … everything is great here. 
        This location is in an actual neighborhood that also has a variety of
        bars with live jazz music and on the weekends they tend to have pop up
        shops too. Parking is tight but other than that this place is
        recommended

        mood for ramen, and they did not disappoint!
