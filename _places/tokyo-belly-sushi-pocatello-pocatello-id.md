        This is a nice little sushi place. We ate here on a Saturday around 2PM.
        Not a common time to eat, so service was very quick and good. We had a
        nice pleasant waitress. We ordered the Tuna Takaki as an appetizer. It
        was okay, but not my favorite. I thought the tuna would be seared right
        before serving, but it appears they probably sear a big hunk of tuna and
        then cut off pieces when they need it. Not my thing, but now I know. We
        took advantage of their three roll combo. The three roll combo is three
        classic rolls for $20. We ordered the Philadelphia Roll, the Salmon Skin
        Roll, and the Alaskan Roll. We love salmon, what can I say. The
        Philadelphia Roll was our favorite of the classic rolls, the smokey
        flavor of the salmon blends so well with the cream cheese. The Alaskan
        Roll was a solid second place, boasting a nice salmon flavor. The Salmon
        Skin Roll was what I would call a “oopsie”. I must’ve thought it would
        be salmon belly, which I know I have enjoyed in the past. The Salmon
        Skill Roll is just what it sounds like, scaly, chewy, no meat, and
        easily my least favorite. But again that’s on me. We also ordered two
        speciality rolls. We ordered the Long Island Roll and the City Hall
        Roll. I highly recommend both of them. They are both a must to order. I
        am unsure if I have a clear favorite of the two. The City Hall Roll
        features an extremely white tuna with cream cheese and is a little
        spicy. The contrasting colors make it look particularly appealing. The
        Long Island Roll is a larger-than-average roll that is absolutely packed
        full of fish. It also has white tuna as well as red snapper, yellow
        tail, and salmon. This roll is amazing with just a little soy sauce to
        enhance its flavor. I will have to come back to this sushi spot in the
        future. I will need to try the Irchiro Roll and Green Delight Roll.

        Overall, I recommend the Tokyo Belly Sushi.

        The server who helped our table was really friendly and attentive. The
        fish was nice in the rolls we ordered and there was a good quantity of
        fish to rice. The restaurant was clean and the decor interesting. A good
        lunchtime experience and I would return when visiting Pocatello. My wife
        likes the miso soup and I thought the dressing on the salad appetizer
        was quite nice

        Had a wonderful lunch experience here. The dining are was clean and
        decorated. We were quickly seated by great staff. The food came fast! We
        had the calamari, wontons, and 3 rolls (Magic, green River, and
        Dynamite). It also came with miso soup and salad. The salad was very
        small but the dressing was good. The miso was excellent. I thought the
        rolls were presented beautifully and compared well to high-end sushi
        restaurants. I was worried this would be “discount sushi” but it was
        high quality and tasted great. If you get a chance, give them a try!

        I relied on the photos and the reviews to choose items for takeout
        dinner for five persons. I am satisfied with the overall quality of the
        food. Special mention for the fresh Chirashi sashimi over rice, and the
        Sushi Tokyo Belly. Unagi don is OK but lacks side garnishes. Teriyaki
        chicken is a little bit dry. Overall, I think this is among the top
        Sushi restaurants in Pocatello.
