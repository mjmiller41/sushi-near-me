        Me: I think the food and service and quality is so good The woman or
        should I say the waitress was so kind I got the Christmas roll and a
        bunch of different rolls I recommend you going on the weekends so you
        can do the all you can eat dinner I ate every single bite of the plate
        and I left it clean. I also had my dad in the restaurant. We were both
        eating dinner. I love the atmosphere and food It is really good. 😎


        My dad: Sushi was great and fresh, enjoyed it with my son, great that
        they have the pictures on the menu and the kids menu pricing. Definitely
        coming back. =)

        Where do I even begin? Sushi Para exceeded all my expectations! From the
        moment I walked in, I was impressed by the clean and inviting
        atmosphere. The simplicity of the decor really allows you to focus on
        the star of the show—the food.


        And let me tell you, the food was absolutely fantastic! Each piece of
        sushi was a masterpiece of flavor and freshness. It's evident that the
        chefs take great pride in their craft. Whether you're a sushi aficionado
        or new to the scene, you'll find something to love here.


        Now, let's talk about value. Lunch at Sushi Para is an absolute steal at
        $22 without tip. Trust me, you won't find a better deal for such
        high-quality sushi anywhere else. It's not just a meal, it's an
        experience that's worth every penny.


        And to top it all off, the staff were incredibly kind and attentive.
        From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and appreciated. It's clear
        that customer satisfaction is a top priority here.

        We came here for their AYCE Lunch special, which was only $22 per
        person. They had tons of rolls to choose from. The service was amazing
        and our food came out incredibly fast. For AYCE, it was good. The sushi
        was fresh and the rolls were decent. It wasn't amazing sushi and I
        wouldn't come here if not for the AYCE deal. I wouldn't recommend their
        spicy tuna roll, it tastes like tuna straight out of the can. Their
        Crunch roll was pretty good, without the cream cheese.


        EDIT: After giving this place a second chance, I have to say their sushi
        is indeed amazing. It really depends on what you get, but their salmon
        and tuna nigiri were really good. They do go heavy on the rice, so
        you'll fill up pretty quickly, but the fish itself was delicious. So
        glad I came back here again and will definitely be back again soon. I
        would recommend coming for their dinner time slots, since they have more
        rolls available. The World Series and Angel Roll were my two favorites!

        Just the soy sauce had a weird taste and the sushi tasted old. However,
        really great service they are so kind in there. But once you get the
        check they will stare you down until you paid for it. And when we asked
        for coke the cans had dirt on the top. I would recommend going when it’s
        not winter time because the fish didn’t seem fresh.
