        My boyfriend and I went for our first time last night and could not have
        had a better experience! I usually stick to a basic California roll but
        our server recommended us her favorite (18th street) and it was
        absolutely delicious.

        Our server, Amy, was the sweetest lady and went above and beyond for us.
        We will definitely be going back soon! 10/10

        Visiting some friends like Chef Paul and his team. A good menu and a
        variety of food, all you can eat, a good option to enjoy with friends. I
        recommend it. Thanks for your attention.

        Everything was so good, definitely recommend the hot lips which are very
        similiar to jalapeño poppers & the New Pilsen roll!! Everything was good
        but those were our favs. We also got tempura, gyoza with cheese, spicy
        edamame & the 18th St. roll. Arianna was a great server & the chef was
        super nice! Definitely will be back

        All You Can Eat sushi has come to Pilsen! I was very excited to try this
        place out. They have an a la carte menu, but we opted for the AYCE menu
        instead.


        We started with miso soup, and I also ordered a Garza Old Fashioned. The
        drink was on the pricey side but very good. We ordered six rolls and
        split them between two people:


        - Golden Gai Ebi Roll: my favorite. Delicious but only came with 5
        pieces, which was the smallest roll of what we ordered.


        - California, Mexican, Pretty Woman & spicy shrimp rolls: your typical
        maki rolls with rice on the outside. They were all good but none of them
        particularly stood out to me.


        - Forest Roll:  This roll was by far the most unique one we tried in
        terms of ingredients and presentation. Unfortunately we both disliked
        it. The roll had too much going on with it, and just wasn't that good. I
        would recommend against getting it unless you really like this
        combination of ingredients.


        The AYCE deal came with dessert so we finished with green tea mochi,
        which was very good.


        My favorite part of the visit was the service. Everyone was very
        friendly and helpful, and it really added a lot to the experience. I
        always appreciate experiencing good service, and Golden Gai did a great
        job. The restaurant itself was also very clean and nicely decorated.


        I gave four stars because I felt the sushi was only decent in flavor and
        quality. The individual rolls are kind of pricey for what they are when
        ordering a la carte, but I felt the AYCE deal was well worth the money.
        I definitely want to come back again soon to try some of their other,
        non-sushi foods on the a la carte menu. Overall, a solid spot if you
        want a casual-yet-upscsle spot in Pilsen for sushi.
