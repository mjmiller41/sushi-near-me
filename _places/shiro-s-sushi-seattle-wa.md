        My wife and I ate at the omakase here at the bar! While it's not as
        edomai as Kashiba (all pieces had some sauce or seasoning on top), the
        taste was fantastic. Additionally, the environment is very casual so
        there were many friendly discussions and no concern of noise. The
        restroom is shared with other restaurants unfortunately, but the service
        was amazing as well.


        If I had to dine-in, I would go to Kashiba. However, for omakase Chef
        Sean and Taro gave us an unforgettable, enjoyable omakase experience.
        Will def recommend to others!

        Shiro’s sushi is one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle. It feels
        traditional and comfortable, and the seafood is truly top notch. They
        have two options for their main menu - A selection of 19 nigiri over 5
        courses for $85 per person (what we went with) or a seat at the omakase
        bar during select times for $140 per person. I think it’s a really good
        deal either way and you definitely get what you pay for.


        All 5 omakase courses featured a variety of fish that are either local
        or flown in from all over the world, mostly from Japan. The omakase was
        presented beautifully and our server was very attentive and
        knowledgeable about each fish/course.


        The variety of fish presented made it a super interesting experience. My
        favorites include the 4 kinds tuna, the uni roll really stood out to me
        - it was fragrant with a generous portion, and I loved the 5th course
        with the variety of textures ranging from a toro roll to the egg
        omelette. The scallop was fantastic and super fresh.


        Lastly, the miso marinated black cod is my favorite fish entree ever. It
        is AMAZING. highly recommend.


        If you love sushi half as much as I do, I cannot recommend this place
        enough - it’s truly amazing.

        Im so glad i booked this reservation from the moment we entered the
        establishment. The hostess was very welcoming and attentive, offering to
        take our coats Immediately. The chefs were amazing the perfect balance
        between professionals and comedians. They thoroughly explained each
        piece of fish as well as the garnishes. The Way the chefs were able to
        balance flavors without compromising the natural, sweetness and
        fattiness of some of the fishes was extraordinary. The service was
        excellent, and the price point was fair. You can never go wrong with
        dinner and a show. Amazing Staff with amazing skills.

        chefs are friendly, engaging, and teach you all about the items on the
        menu. They make it fun and personalize the experience the best they can.
        The staff is extremely attentive. The food was beyond amazing. I will
        definitely be going back. My only complaint is parking but it's to be
        expected in Belltown.
