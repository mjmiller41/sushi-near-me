        Went for a long awaited date night on a busy Saturday evening. Placed a
        reservation earlier in the week but was sat in the bar section, which is
        not as intimate as dining room. I feel that management didn’t have a
        specific table reserved and was flying by the seat of their pants.


        Tried a bunch of dishes on happy hour. Baos were great, full of flavor.
        Coco roll was fun if you like toasted coconut. Triple tail was fresh.
        Volcano roll was lackluster. Buffalo rock shrimp was inventive but not
        memorable.


        Ordered the eight ball (octopus) and it was phenomenal! Finished the
        evening with a bread pudding and a lava cake. Bread pudding was
        exceptional (allow 15-20 minutes as it’s baked fresh).


        Server was friendly but service was inconsistent (drinks came after
        food, long wait times for certain dishes).


        Overall we enjoyed. We will return for octopus and bread pudding.

        Went for a long awaited date night on a busy Saturday evening. Placed a
        reservation earlier in the week but was sat in the bar section, which is
        not as intimate as dining room. I feel that management didn’t have a
        specific table reserved and was flying by the seat of their pants.


        Tried a bunch of dishes on happy hour. Baos were great, full of flavor.
        Coco roll was fun if you like toasted coconut. Triple tail was fresh.

        Omg I wish I could have had everything on the menu, it all looked so
        good! The appetizers were so diverse. The sushi was chefs kiss! And you
        cannot leave without having the best lava cake of your life. The service
        was phenomenal. We got seated right at our reservation even though they
        were slammed. Food came out quickly, they had some unique drinks that
        were strong. Everything we ordered was so well curated and the flavors
        were so thoughtful. I’m saving the best for last though, Daniela was
        amazing coolest person ever she gave the best recommendations and made
        sure we were taken care of! I only have the first and last photos
        because I was having too much fun and forgot to take more photos

        Sushi Pop is our go-to sushi restaurant, offering reliably delicious
        small plates—some of which are staples, and some that rotate seasonally.
        It’s exciting to try some of the seasonal offerings each time and see
        how they’ve created new and interesting versions of nigiri and rolls
        with their top-notch ingredients. They servers will give you
        recommendations about dishes to try based on what you like, but the
        truth is that everything is so good. We always have excellent service,
        food that comes out quickly, interesting options to try from, and sushi
        dishes that are expertly crafted. Their mocktail is one of my favorites,
        too. The portions are great, and the prices are very reasonable the
        excellent quality. You usually have to go 40 minutes into Orlando for
        great sushi, so we’re really grateful to have Sushi Pop nearby!

        This is our third year having our Christmas party there. The servers,
        the management and owner are just such great people. They all have
        amazing attitudes. They never get our orders wrong and make sure our
        drinks are always full. The food is just insanely delicious. We get to
        try things that you normally can't get anywhere else. This is without a
        doubt the best restaurant I've ever been to in Central Florida. If you
        do go there, I suggest you get the pork belly boa buns.
