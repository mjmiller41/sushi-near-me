        We've been delighted patrons of this place for several years now, and
        our experiences have been nothing short of exceptional. The first thing
        you notice is the extraordinary freshness of the ingredients – every
        bite is a testament to the high quality and dedication to sourcing the
        best produce.

        The atmosphere is warm and inviting, largely due to the incredibly
        friendly staff and the down to earth owner, who always goes out of their
        way to make us feel welcomed.

        One of the unique charms of this restaurant is the beautiful
        hand-painted koi on the wall. It's a beautiful piece of art that adds to
        the authentic ambiance and makes the environment even more enjoyable.

        We wholeheartedly recommend this sushi restaurant to anyone looking for
        a delightful dining experience.

        our experiences have been nothing short of exceptional. The first thing
        you notice is the extraordinary freshness of the ingredients – every
        bite is a testament to the high quality and dedication to sourcing the
        best produce.

        The atmosphere is warm and inviting, largely due to the incredibly
        friendly staff and the down to earth owner, who always goes out of their
        way to make us feel welcomed.

        One of the unique charms of this restaurant is the beautiful
        hand-painted koi on the wall. It's a beautiful piece of art that adds to
        the authentic ambiance and makes the environment even more enjoyable.

        We wholeheartedly recommend this sushi restaurant to anyone looking for
        a delightful dining experience.

        As a sushi consumer for more than 40 years I seldom hesitate to try a
        place that is new to me. Quite often I walk out once I see the selection
        in the counter box. If what I see pleases me or I notice something
        special, I will stay.


        What attracted me was a chalkboard that listed Sweet Shrimp and a couple
        types of fish belly. I also noticed a specialty roll that I found very
        intriguing. When they told me the shrimp included the head, I was
        hooked.


        Their Toro was just ok. $15 for a couple small slices, not something I
        would order again. The Salmon Belly I liked much better, silky smooth
        with generous cuts. The star was the Sweet Shrimp. A succulent and tasty
        treasure that almost melted in my mouth. The crunchy head battered and
        cooked to perfection.


        As is customary, I tried the Tempura Shrimp and liked it as well. A very
        light batter, just a tad oily, that lets you experience the shrimp
        flavor. A different version that I found appealing.


        I did not try the roll I wanted because I was full. A complimentary Miso
        Soup and Spring Roll were a nice touch. The service was very good, they
        were patient, helpful, attentive and friendly throughout. I will be
        coming back. Come get you some.

        Must try! I came here more than 30 times. so delicious (I eat mainly
        sushi and roll) and everyone is nice here. I love it!

        Chicken karaake and Agedashi tofu is also good.

        First time came here, it’s in a small area at a plaza. I would say it
        was clean when we walked in and served immediately as soon we sat down.
        The vibe good have been more vibrant, it’s a small restaurant. Our
        server was great and attentive to everything. The food was good except
        for the portions. Their portion sizes were a bit small and price was a
        little expensive for the amount you get. I got a side salad from my
        entrée and it had too much ginger dressing my lettuce was soaked in it.
        The sushi dinner could have been more portion for $25 what we paid for.
        Hibachi was great but noodles were a little bland. I left there wanting
        more but would go somewhere else next time.

        Stopped in for a late lunch today ..  it's a quaint place, plenty of
        seating. The staff was super attentive  -  drinks were delivered
        immediately and appetizers shortly after.. our rolls were beautifully
        presented on a boat.. Our server was hospitable and  pointed out each
        roll specifically.  We had a fresh feast on crab, tuna and salmon, the
        rice was delicious..  so soft and warm.


        The sushi chef even checked on us!!

        Our drinks were refilled without asking..


        We'll be back for sushi.. I look forward to door dashing too!!
