        I've been coming to Kohnami for nearly 20 years. Now living abroad, I
        can only visit once a year during the holiday season, I was really
        surprised to learn from the staff today that there is new ownership. We
        joked with our waiter that they have some big shoes to fill. Lol :) And
        the sushi was awesome! They kept our favorites - The Great Coveted  Snow
        White roll and the crispy Salmon Skin roll! Thank you for the great
        evening and looking forward to the next 20 years with the new staff.

        This is my favorite shushi spot in town. The boys ordered a good amount
        and they gave us a boat. This fully delighted them!!! And as you know
        it's the little things.  They even went out on a limb and tried the
        octopus. The sushi here is the freshest in town hands down. And the
        service is always second to none. Add in a chill atmosphere and little
        wait for one of their tables and this is the spot.

        Really good sushi! Fairly small area, but the quality of the fish is
        amazing and, the service was very kind. The waiter was attentive with my
        water refill, and I had a fun time. Super good place to go to relax from
        work!

        My husband and I have been going here for months and is still the best
        sushi I've had in town. Loved the atmosphere of a mom and pop shop with
        some really cute, unique touches. The two guys working there were
        amazing. We have loved all the different sushi we have tried.

        Me and my wife found this place a year ago when we came to Colorado
        Springs for our honeymoon, and at first we couldn’t find this place.
        It’s small and tucked away in a shopping center and not immediately
        visible from the road.


        Man are we glad we found this little slice of heaven, we were first
        treated with a hot bowl of Miso Soup and it was absolutely delicious, it
        was me and my wife’s first time ever having Miso and we became big fans
        afterwards.


        Then we got our sushi order and my goodness we were overwhelmed by how
        delicious the food was. We are huge connoisseurs of sushi and this place
        the best sushi we had ever had.


        Jump ahead a year later, because of work and a new job my wife and I now
        live in Colorado Springs and we live 10 minutes from Kohnami Sushi and
        of course we had to go there the minute we moved in to our new home, it
        has changed ownership according to employees, but you would never know
        because food is still as delicious as it was when we first came here a
        year earlier. We even tried the cream cheese wontons recently and they
        were delicious.


        This is going to be our new end of the week spot going forward and I
        highly recommend this place of your looking for some excellent sushi
