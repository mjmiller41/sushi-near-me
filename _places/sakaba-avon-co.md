        Amazing time at Sakaba! Excellent menu that should hit the spot for
        anyone. We particularly loved the California roll with soy paper (not
        seaweed), as well as the lobster roll.


        The sake menu is also on point and we asked for a flight to try a few
        different types.


        In the winter, dress warm and ask to be seated outside. Lots of heaters,
        fireplaces, and blankets.


        We’ll be back.

        One of the biggest reasons I recommend this restaurant is because of the
        atmosphere. There’s an indoor and outdoor seating, which is perfect for
        the summertime if you want to enjoy the nice weather. 🍃🌹🌸


        The food is also very yummy, the seafood is very fresh, but here’s the
        deal: it is not cheap. I didn’t expect it to be! But I had higher
        expectations for what I was paying for.


        My favorite things on the menu were the signature lobster roll, and the
        signature salmon avocado sisho. Those were def 10 out of 10.✨🍣


        However, the reason I gave this restaurant a 4/5 was because generally
        the rest of the food was truly between a two to four out of five.


        I think this restaurant is perfect to have a little bite with your
        family and friends but I wouldn’t recommend it as a place you would go
        to have a full meal.


        I don’t want to miss out on mentioning that the service was spectacular!


        Overall a def 4/5!

        For people who enjoy sushi, it is fantastic. If you’re a sushi-lite
        person, go elsewhere. Everything was fantastic, highly recommend the
        miso black cod. Would go back here over Matsuhisa in Vail, and cannot
        wait to go back. Our best sushi experience in the Valley so far!

        We had reservations and when we made our reservations we called to
        inquire about parking.  We told there would be complementary valet out
        front.  Our friends arrived first and were allowed to park free of
        charge and then when we arrived 5 minutes later they wanted $100 for our
        car.  I’m pretty sure the valet guys are stereotyping who they want to
        give free parking too.  Never again!

  Buzz Around Sakaba's Reviews$$$Folks chatting about Sakaba often highlight the
  fantastic flavors of fresh sushi and signature rolls that make every bite feel
  special, with many calling it one of the best spots for Japanese places
  nearby. The welcoming vibe, complete with outdoor seating and attentive
  service, comes up a lot as a highlight for casual get-togethers or date
  nights, adding to the overall charm. While most agree the sake selections and
  creative menu items hit the mark for a satisfying meal, a couple of mentions
  point to occasional hassles like parking that didn't quite live up to
  expectations. Still, the general consensus leans positive, praising it as a
  solid pick for anyone hunting for top-rated sushi close to home in a cozy,
  resort-style environment. All in all, it's clear that Sakaba keeps things
  lively and delicious, making it worth a try for your next outing.
