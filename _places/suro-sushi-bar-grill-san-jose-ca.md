        We happened to be craving sushi and were passing by - luckily we stopped
        in.

        We had a very nice welcome even though they were close to closing.

        The interior is very modern, clean and inviting.

        Staff were very nice, orders were taken quickly and the food arrived
        very fast too.

        We were all very happy with the food we ate, the sushi was very fresh.
        The portions were very substantial too compared to other places we’ve
        visited in the area.

        My only regret is I had not stopped in here earlier. We definitely will
        be back.

        (Be aware it is closed on Tuesdays).

        First, the food is very good. Fresh edamame, tasty miso, and delicious
        tempura. I had the Santa Cruz, which didn’t look anything like the menu
        photo but appeared to have full content, and I enjoyed it. Both the beef
        and chicken teriyaki were chewy, but the tempura was marvelous.


        They are refreshing the decor inside and out, with tables from another
        restaurant with old decals, so a work in progress. Service was pretty
        abysmal. Nothing came in the order we requested, nobody came by to clear
        plates, and the servers weren’t busy, standing around and muttering
        amongst themselves. The final rub was the stink eye we got when we
        requested to exit through the plainly marked exit door to our car parked
        in the disabled spot just outside. Keep the kitchen staff and fire
        everyone else, my opinion.

        I wish I had dined in for this one.


        The food was so good that even tho I did not get the seaweed salad I
        ordered, I still give Suro five stars overall. What i did get is the
        cucumber salad that was in the lightest lemon vinegar. It was very
        delightful.


        My garlic edamame is divine, and the roles were fresh, flavorful and
        filling. I am looking forward to the next time I plan a sushi date so I
        can experience the atmosphere as well.


        Certainly can't complain about the take-out!
