        Quick and delicious. 12pcs in 45 minutes

        $110 incl taxes fees & 20% gratuity


        A few of our bites were a bit on the bland side, but that comes from
        someone who is used to a lot more sauce on their nigiri. Plus the chef
        prob wants us to really taste the natural sweetness and flavors of the
        fish. The sushi chef is quite innovative and experimental with the food.


        If you do the 8pm seating or earlier you can go outside right after to
        grab some hand rolls if you’re still hungry (they close at 9pm). Same
        owner, same kitchen, same high quality fish. We shared 6 rolls among us
        4 after 😛

        One of the best omakase experiences you can get in Austin without having
        to bend over backwards for a reservation or sacrifice your wallet for.


        Experience, attention to detail, and flavors are not compromised. Each
        bite is unique and balanced. I actually love that it is a 45 minute
        experience because honestly it takes a few minutes to consume one bite
        of nigiri lol.


        Would recommend to anyone looking to try an authentic and cost effective
        omakase for the first time, or even seasoned omakase enthusiasts

        This is not necessarily the best Sushi that you can get in Austin. When
        you're coming here, you're booking for the 45-minute omakase experience.
        Mind you it is definitely an experience and that does come with a price
        tag. The place is very cozy and you are sitting at a bar like structure
        with a sushi chef at the center and a drinks/sake guide.


        We immediately went in and started to get our nigiri pieces of fish.
        Each time the chef put a new nigiri on our plate, he explained every
        single detail that went into making that particular piece of the nigiri.
        I would definitely say that the additions to the fish really was thought
        out on all of the flavors to compliment that particular fish.


        This is definitely an experience because instead of just getting a piece
        of fish you're getting something very creative. In fact, I would say
        perhaps something you might not be able to get at other sushi places. We
        started out and the sushi was pretty good, but as we continued through
        the courses each piece got better and better. The A5 wagyu Sushi piece
        was mind-blowing and also the uni was so buttery and did not taste
        bitter which I give all of the compliments to the sushi chef. As the
        sauce and pairing of what was in the sushi must have really brought out
        the flavor.


        My favorite pieces were the A5 Wagyu, the Ebi, toro, and Uni.


        I got the sake flight and it was a very good pairing with all of the
        different sushi pieces. I do wish that I had maybe three to four more
        pieces of sushi, but maybe that is just wishful thinking because
        everything was so good. If you haven't been to Omakase in Austin, I
        would definitely give this a try.


        I did happen to go the place next door that served hand rolls and got a
        spicy tuna and salmon. I'm definitely going to try to hit this place up
        for lunch one day and gorge myself in hand rolls. You can definitely
        tell that the fish was fresh.

        Great ayce omakase. They have a variety of fish and creative
        combinations. I love their miso soup and fish collar.

        Docked a star because the rice portion is on the heavier side. I thought
        it was because we were in an ayce experience, but after looking at other
        non-ayce photos, it seems like it's just their style.

        My husband and I finished about 20 pieces on average, but there were
        still a lot left from their offerings, so you would walk out full.
