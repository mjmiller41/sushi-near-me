        Sam was amazing! So helpful and attentive. The food just as amazing.
        Shrimp tacos were delectable. The carrot cake has such amazing taste and
        texture. Can’t wait to come back!

        I took my daughter here for Valentine's Day dinner. The customer service
        was exceptional even though the place was wall-to-wall people they still
        took time to say hello and had champagne to celebrate Valentine's Day
        while we waited for our table. We had sushi to start, and it was
        delicious. I don't believe that it was worth $22. I've had this
        particular sushi roll at other places for half the cost taste just as
        good I had the steak and lobsters special for $70, and she had the
        salmon. the lobster was good, but it did not have any dipping butter.
        The steak was tender and perfectly cooked but had little to no flavor or
        moisture, which I found to be odd. I am not a steak sauce person, so I
        expect more flavor for a $70 meal. My daughter's salmon was perfectly
        cooked and moist. It also did not have a lot of flavor. Unfortunately, I
        think Kona Grill is afraid to add flavor due to individuals with medical
        conditions. Overall, I think the name is what Rises the cost of the
        food. I don't believe that I would recommend Kona Grill for the amount
        of money that I spent.

        Dec 21st. My birthday as well as many other birthday parties were going
        on at the same time. The property was packed,  Reservations I'd say are
        a must! Unless you enjoy waiting.  We were seated on time, and our
        server was fast polite, engaging, and knew the menu well. The food was
        just okay. It's not great and, in my opinion, not worth the price which
        by the way is NOT CHEAP. We are from South Padre Island and come up to
        the Lee's Summit/KC annually this time of year.. Unfortunately, this
        establishment is a one and done..

        Plotted. Scouts Out..

        I had the BEST dining experience at Kona Grill! 🤩  Our server, Xena,
        was absolutely amazing.  She made the end of 2024 feel extra special ✨. 
        Seriously, the service was top-notch, and I felt so well taken care of. 
        Definitely ask for Xena when you go!  💯 #KonaGrill

        Good place to start the night-out with happy hour specials.


        I had their Shrimp Taco (spicy), their Spicy Tuna Roll, their
        Potstickers, and sliders. everything felt fresh and enjoyable.


        Service could have been quicker for a Happy Hour and "tapas-like" food,
        but would definitely return.
