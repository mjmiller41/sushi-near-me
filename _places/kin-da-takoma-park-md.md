        Clean restaurant with friendly service and very reasonable prices. Was
        able to try a wide assortment of dishes, which were all very tasty and
        flavorful.


        My favorite was the Pad Thai which had the signature salty, umami taste
        from the fish sauce. I think it's one of the best I've had in the area
        so I would definitely recommend that. The papaya salad was very
        refreshing and I especially liked the spicy sauce from the Prik King.


        My first time trying the mango sticky rice dessert. Despite mangos not
        being in season, I thought it was a great combination of flavors and
        never had anything quite like it.


        Overall, I think the food was very much worth the price and I will be
        back if in the area. Recommend!

        Overall, I think the food was very much worth the price and I will be
        back if in the area. Recommend!

        Ordered Basil Fried Rice, Drunken Noodles and Tom kha soup and
        completely disappointed with the quality. The fried rice was bland,
        lacking the rich flavor and seasoning that should make it a standout
        dish. It tasted like plain, overcooked rice with a few scattered veggies
        and bits of protein that barely added anything to the dish. As for the
        drunken noodles, they were a soggy mess, with noodles clumped together
        and an overly sweet sauce that masked any depth of flavor. The portion
        size was also smaller than expected for the price, making the meal feel
        even more underwhelming. If you’re looking for quality Thai food, I
        suggest going elsewhere.

        Ordered delivery via Caviar and it came quickly. Both of my sushi rolls
        were disgusting. The rice was mushy and smeared with fingetprints. The
        avocado was brown and extremely soft. The fish was warm and stringy. Two
        of the yellowtail roll pieces had no fish. I still tried it and ate one
        piece of each before giving up. It was really gross. I used to love this
        place. I honestly don’t know how someone would think this is acceptable
        food to serve someone.

        I am Bill Yee Thai. Huge lover and purveyor of the Thai cuisine. I have
        dined at over 260 Thais in the DMV. I live only blocks now from this
        location. I love! Love it! I do enjoy sushi but have yet to try but
        will. The Thai alone is beyond fresh and elite in my opinion. This is a
        well run tight business with many happy returning customers I notice.
        Prik khing is my fave and it never lets me down. Sawatdee ka!!!!!
