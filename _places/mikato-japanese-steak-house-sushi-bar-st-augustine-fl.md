        Mikato in St. Augustine Beach is your typical Japanese Steak House.


        What we ate - Chef’s Special (lobster, shrimp and scallops), chicken &
        filet hibachi, Amazing Roll sushi.


        Pros - restaurant was clean. Service was excellent. Soup was 10/10 -
        very flavorful. My husband said the Chef’s special was very good, and he
        said the Amazing Roll was one of the best sushi rolls he’s *ever* had.
        Filet was tender.


        Cons - neither one of us liked the salad dressing (they have ginger and
        mayonnaise…we didn’t like either). I didn’t like the yum yum (white)
        sauce. I like a sweet yum yum sauce, but theirs was not sweet at all.


        Mixed feelings - the food coming off the hibachi grill did not have much
        flavor. My husband liked that because he likes the taste of the seafood
        without strong sauces. I didn’t like it as much for my filet and
        chicken. Usually when we eat hibachi, if I don’t like the flavor or if
        there isn’t much flavor, I just use the Yum Yum sauce and it’s all good.
        However, because I didn’t like their sauce, it didn’t help me tonight. I
        added soy sauce to my rice which made it somewhat better, but fairly
        bland overall. We have a Japanese Steak House back home that’s my
        favorite. I always compare others to it. Mikato didn’t  measure up, but
        I’m still giving four stars for the soup, sushi, Chef’s Special and
        service.

        A little expensive and very busy with wait almost 2 hrs. The food was
        great but no noodles included with hibachi only rice and although
        quantity was good it was more expensive than some of the other hibachi
        places nearby. The hibachi show was also a bit lackluster. Not as many
        tricks specially since we had a party of kids excited for a lot more
        than just volcano. It's not a bad place and  food was good but between
        the price, wait and show I would honestly go somewhere first. Otherwise
        it's a solid choice for hibachi and Japanese steakhouse.

        By his request, we had our son's 12 year old birthday here and it was a
        great experience. Not only was the service excellent, and the food
        delicious, but the chef made the night memorable with the show he put
        on.


        We had a super fun night to remember, lots of laughter and full bellies.
        Thanks Mikato!

        It's a local authentic  Japanese Restaurant.  ...

        We enjoyed  our dinner last night.

        The ambiance  was good. It has at least 3 sets of hibachi  grilled  that
        sit 10-12 people times 2 grilled per set. price was good too about $33
        plus drinks and tips.

        The entertainment  was  just okay. Needs improvement.  ...

        But the food was delicious. It's tasty and perfectly cooked. ...

        We encountered some regulars. They been coming  for 10 years.

        They saw how the restaurant expand and some history of the chefs.  They
        also said it's been running  for 30 years.  ...

        We had a wonderful dinner and met some regulars. ...
