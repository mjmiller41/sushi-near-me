        The sushi here is tasty and fresh, and the location is really nice—close
        to the ocean. Only downside is you gotta stand in line to order, and
        they don’t give you a menu ahead of time. So you end up deciding what
        you want right at the register, which slows things down. Other than
        that, it’s great. Sushi comes out fast, and the staff is super friendly.
        Definitely recommend!

        The sushi here is tasty and fresh, and the location is really nice—close
        to the ocean. Only downside is you gotta stand in line to order, and
        they don’t give you a menu ahead of time. So you end up deciding what
        you want right at the register, which slows things down. Other than
        that, it’s great. Sushi comes out fast, and the staff is super friendly.
        Definitely recommend!

        The food was excellent! We tried several dishes, including karaage,
        sushi, katsu curry, and a couple of others I can’t quite remember, and
        we were happy with everything. It was a pleasant surprise to see katsu
        curry on the menu. The service was quick, and the staff was very
        friendly. This is clearly a popular spot—though we arrived before the
        dinner rush, the seats filled up fast.

        Exceptional Japanese cuisine, great service, and stellar atmosphere
        accompanied with a great music selection! Sushi rolls were of high
        quality. No question the rest of the menu is held to the same standards!

        After meeting the owners and finding out what a lovely family they were,
        we decided to give their restaurant a try. I moved here from Eugene,
        Oregon and have not been able to find a place that resembles a
        restaurant that I deeply miss. I’ve gone to multiple places but the
        flavors weren’t quite right. Their Teriyaki chicken was really good and
        great flavor. I got the dinner plate that was huge! I was not expecting
        such an impressive sized plate, could have definitely shared this with
        my husband.


        It’s also very difficult to find a place where all of us can agree on
        and my kids loved their sushi, this is definitely a place we will come
        to more often. I also really enjoyed the simple atmosphere, I want to be
        at a place because the food is great, the owners are polite and very
        family oriented and genuinely take the time and effort to create
        delicious meals.

        We enjoyed the food here. Poke bowls were delicious and fresh. Teriyaki
        chicken was tasty. Price was reasonable. Great place to stop by in Ocean
        Side.
