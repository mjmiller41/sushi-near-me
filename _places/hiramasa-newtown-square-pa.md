        The ambiance was warm and inviting, the staff were incredibly attentive,
        and every dish we tried was absolutely phenomenal.

        The highlights of the meal were undoubtedly the crispy tuna and oysters.
        Beyond the outstanding food, the service was equally exceptional. Steve,
        our server, was fantastic—knowledgeable, friendly, and always a step
        ahead, ensuring our dining experience was seamless from start to
        finish.Overall, this was one of the best meals we’ve had in a long time.
        We can’t wait to come back!

        The ambiance was warm and inviting, the staff were incredibly attentive,
        and every dish we tried was absolutely phenomenal.

        The highlights of the meal were undoubtedly the crispy tuna and oysters.
        Beyond the outstanding food, the service was equally exceptional. Steve,
        our server, was fantastic—knowledgeable, friendly, and always a step
        ahead, ensuring our dining experience was seamless from start to
        finish.Overall, this was one of the best meals we’ve had in a long time.
        We can’t wait to come back!

        The quality of the food, the service, as well as the atmosphere separate
        Hiramasa from most other Japanese Sushi bars in the area. The
        ingredients are fresh and refined. The plating presentation is clean and
        elevated. The ambiance is modern and sophisticated and the service
        complements the scene.


        Our waiter Steve was attentive, knowledgeable, and easygoing. However,
        the most impactful part of the evening was being able to order off-menu
        items. The chefs gladly accommodated our dietary restrictions and far
        exceeded expectations.

        Went here with a bud that lived nearby. He made reservations, we arrived
        a little late but they honored our reservation.


        First thing first, we ordered the bone marrow dish, it wasn’t a lot of
        food, but it was so delicious. We also ordered another app but I can not
        seem to remember.


        My buddy ordered an array of rolls for us to try. It ended out on this
        wooden tray, and then they activate the dry ice. It’s cool for
        presentation.


        This place I would say is great for date night, or special occasion.
        This isn’t your local sushi spot in a shopping mall, even if this one
        is. It’s more upscale and high end.


        Would come again, for the above stated reasons.

        Hiramasa offers an unparalleled dining experience, thanks to its
        incredibly fresh ingredients and diverse menu. From the moment we tasted
        our first bite, we could tell that the quality of the seafood and other
        ingredients was exceptional—fresh, flavorful, and carefully selected.
        The variety of choices on the menu allowed us to explore different
        flavors and dishes that we wouldn’t easily find elsewhere, making the
        meal both exciting and satisfying.

        Additionally, Hiramasa features a spacious and well-stocked bar area,
        which I’m excited to try on my next visit. This restaurant exceeded my
        expectations in every way, and I will definitely be coming back for
        another unforgettable meal!
