        I've lived all over and the only other place I had sushi this good was
        Hawaii. The quality is exceptional. We always order the boat and the
        cuts are always melt-in-your-mouth. Whenever I order omakase, I'm never
        disappointed. Even my 20-something sons recognize the superior quality
        and they don't have terribly discerning palates. They also love the
        serene and peaceful atmosphere. Even when multiple tables are seated, it
        retains a quiet ambience. Ben Gui is a reason to live in Roanoke. It's
        pure pleasure for the senses on all levels and not something I ever
        expected to find when returning to my home region, southern Appalachia.

        I've lived all over and the only other place I had sushi this good was
        Hawaii. The quality is exceptional. We always order the boat and the
        cuts are always melt-in-your-mouth. Whenever I order omakase, I'm never
        disappointed. Even my 20-something sons recognize the superior quality
        and they don't have terribly discerning palates. They also love the
        serene and peaceful atmosphere. Even when multiple tables are seated, it
        retains a quiet ambience. Ben Gui is a reason to live in Roanoke. It's
        pure pleasure for the senses on all levels and not something I ever
        expected to find when returning to my home region, southern Appalachia.

        I had an absolutely fantastic experience at Ben Gui Sushi in Roanoke!
        Despite being on a budget, I decided to treat myself, and it was worth
        every penny. The uni was incredibly fresh—straight off the truck, as Ben
        himself shared with me—and it was a delight to indulge in such
        high-quality sushi. I even went a little over budget to try something
        new, and I’m so glad I did.


        One thing that really stood out to me is that he talked to almost every
        customer and knew their story. It reminded me of my childhood sushi hang
        out with my family, where everybody knew me, and was always waiting for
        me to come back even through my college days, despite it changing hands,
        someone on the staff always knew who I was. Brought back great childhood
        nostalgia especially since my mom passed recently.


        Ben personally served me and made the experience even more memorable
        with great conversation. His passion for sushi and his customers really
        shines through, and it’s rare to find such a warm and welcoming
        atmosphere. I enjoyed getting to know about his personal story and how
        he came from New York to Roanoake and I can’t wait to hear more about
        it. The food was impeccable, and the care in preparation was evident in
        every bite. Thank you Ben ❤️


        Even though it’s a bit of a drive from Blacksburg, I already can’t wait
        to go back. I’ve already started telling my partner about the amazing
        sushi. I found in the area. This place is a true gem, and I’m so
        grateful for both the food and the company. Highly recommend stopping by
        if you’re in the area—or even if you’re not! It’s definitely worth the
        trip.

        So I read a review from five weeks ago (at least) that says that they
        didn’t have the ice machine working. It’s a total bait switch like the
        other review said.  We went in there and were charged $1.50 for bottled
        water. The server didn’t convey that we would be charged a price.
        Seaweed was super fishy. I had to deconstruct my role. The server
        didn’t  even come up to the table properly and we weren’t offered
        glasses. The menu prices are more than what they said on the menu, fine
        with that, but don’t tell me that there’s a price of something and then
        up charge me for  it. Also, if your ice machine doesn’t work that
        doesn’t mean that your tap water doesn’t work. If you can’t provide
        people with drinking water then what are you doing in your dishes with
        and washing a fish with, washing their hands with?  How do you wash your
        dishes? How do you wash your hands in the restroom? How do you flush the
        toilet? There was obviously water there and I think that they just
        wanted to get away with charging more.. I will not be coming back again
        and I do not recommend this place.

        This is our favorite sushi place in VA. the sushi is always yummy,  the
        owners at always welcoming, and the place is always clean.  We get the
        boat,  pretty much every time,  and it's worth it.  I typically don't
        like like eel or spicy tuna,  but one of their roles have both and I
        enjoyed it.  If you like sushi,  this is a must stop by place.

        Absolutely. A hidden treasure as I am not from roanoke originally and
        looked up sushi.  My husband was feeling pretty bummed after a medical
        diagnosis, and I brought him here to cheer him up.  Not only did he have
        a phenomenal time with the best sushi, but the owner was very engaging
        and kind.  I'd give them a 100 stars if I could!
