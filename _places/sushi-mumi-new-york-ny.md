        My first time eating here was back in early 2024, honestly I was
        skeptical at first but everything turn out great, the food and
        atmosphere and the people. The Chef is loud at times but he is a very
        nice guy if you talk to him (Don't judge the look). Since then this is
        one of my go to places for Omakase. For the price of $250 this is one of
        traditional Omakase similar to Ichimura, Yoshino, Noda, Sushi Sho, Shota
        etc. I recommend giving this place a try.

        TLDR: Sushi Mumi is a proper omakase in the East Village where Kura used
        to be. Chef is a former Ginza Onodera alum so if you're missing that
        kinda flavor since they've closed - this is a good spot to pick.


        Came to Sushi Mumi after a few folks recommended it. It occupies the
        former space where Kura was (RIP) and a former Ginza Onodera chef runs
        the counter.


        The menu is on the higher tier of the sushi circuit at $250 before
        tax/gratuity with 5 otsumami, 10 nigiri/sushi, tamago, soup, dessert.
        The ostumami definitely allowed chef to show off his skills with the
        cooked dishes.


        The the hamo or pike conger which was served with jasmine vinegar jelly
        was the crowed favorite. Very tender with that fragrant scent of the
        jasmine and the tang of the vinegar jelly. The amadai fried with the
        scales on was also enjoyable mixed with the hairy crab sauce. The
        grilled nodoguro was excellent as well.


        The shari is cooked very well as you'd expect from someone of this
        caliber. There's a deep red hue with the nice salty tang from the
        vinegar. The nigiri was excellent with the stand outs for me being the
        shima aji and iwashi. It's a comfortable restaurant and if you're
        looking for a break from the budget omakases - this is a spot that a lot
        of sushi connoisseursm frequent.

        You def cannot find another place can be better than Mumi with this
        price in the city.


        Mumi’s ingredients are same or even better than those Michelin Omakases
        you can find in the city - but those choices cost more for sure.


        Chef is a vet from Ginza Onodera - experienced and dedicated on his
        works.


        I’m not going to comment on the flavor - there’re a thousand hamlets in
        a thousand people’s eyes. I definitely like it, but I can’t guarantee
        everyone does.


        However, as long as you’re not committed in Michelin traps, Mumi is one
        of your best options for sushi omakase in New York City - I’m not gonna
        say the best, but they deserve a try.

        It’s run by a long-time friend of mine who takes his work seriously and
        has high standards, and has not changed a bit over the years.


        The fish is flown in directly from Japan, and you can really taste the
        difference. Each piece is fresh and well-prepared, especially the sea
        bream, which is top-notch.


        You can see the attention to detail in every sushi roll. The atmosphere
        is relaxed, but there’s a clear professionalism in how everything is
        done. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, making sure you have a
        good experience.


        Best sushi in NYC in this price range.


        It is worth a visit if you appreciate good sushi. With high-quality
        ingredients and a serious approach to the craft, it’s a standout spot
        for sushi lovers!

        A treat from my sweet nephew Ian. Best omakashe that didn’t add toppings
        flowers caviar lobster etc to make it special. I am a purist I like my
        food with minimal sauces because I love the taste of fresh ingredients!
        Chef Marco got this right ! The taste matters. His preparation in
        maturation of his fish and his menu made it for me. Each course was
        different and delicate but so good. The devil is in the details. A treat
        from my nephew. Highly recommend esp during June & July when most ppl
        are away to secure a reservation.
