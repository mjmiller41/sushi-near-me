        Masu is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the Portland Metro area.
        We got referred to Masu after telling someone we intended to go to
        Janken to celebrate a birthday. I recently moved to Portland from
        Vancouver, BC, and have been trying to find a solid sushi restaurant at
        a reasonable price. This, I find, is something that Portland lacks in
        comparison to Vancouver, BC. However, I found that Masu is on par with a
        lot of the best sushi restaurants located in Vancouver, BC.


        Located in the heart of downtown Portland’s Pearl District, Masu did not
        disappoint. The food was amazing, the fish was fresh and all at
        reasonable price. Masu is also much less busier than Janken. The drinks
        and atmosphere was not a flamboyant as Jankens but, the food itself was
        much better and a more reasonable price. If you are a sushi lover and
        are in Portland, I highly recommend trying Masu.

        We had a great time here; was catching a show at Crystal Ballroom so
        decided to have dinner here before the show. We ordered several
        different dishes; Japonista, Lioness, tempura, St Helen’s Volcano, even
        tried the Uni (which was harvested from my hometown Santa Barbara).
        Topped it off with the Sweet Potato cake. The service we received was
        fine, nobody was rude to us and we never felt ignored. The guy who was
        at the bar even brought us a seaweed salad and said it was on the house!
        We will definitely come back and try some of their other dishes.

        This is my favorite upscale sushi place! The food is delicious and the
        flavor combinations of the rolls are inventive. Ambiance is great. It
        has a romantic lounge vibe with soft lighting, and it's quiet enough to
        make conversation easily. The servers are knowledgeable about the menu
        and can make good recommendations. It's also one of the few sushi places
        I've seen that consistently has blue fin tuna! The otoro is my favorite.
        Highly recommend!

        What really sets Masu apart is their desserts! As one of the few
        Japanese restaurants in the area offering such unique and delicious
        sweet options, they never disappoint. I always make room for dessert
        after enjoying an array of nigiri and a refreshing salad, both of which
        are equally satisfying. If you're a type who appreciates good design,
        Masu's timeless restaurant interior is definitely worth checking out as
        well.
