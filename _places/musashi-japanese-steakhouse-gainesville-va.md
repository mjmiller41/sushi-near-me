        We visited Musashi Japanese Steakhouse, located in Gainesville,
        Virginia.


        This Japanese steakhouse features Hibachi cooktop cooking in front of
        guests and an extremely versed sushi menu. We have eaten here several
        times after discovering this restaurant more recently and have had an
        excellent dinner with either Hibachi or sushi. You really can't go wrong
        here with what is on the menu.


        Everything we've had has been very delightful and delicious, and the
        staff is very attentive and courteous.


        On our last visit, I had the Hibachi scallop and fillet, steak fixed
        medium rare with the Hibachi stir fry vegetables and fried rice. We also
        had a couple of sushi rolls to share that came in a little wooden boat,
        much to my delight and surprise.


        I highly recommend this restaurant if you like Japanese hibachi or
        sushi. Beware, though, that this restaurant really fills up around lunch
        and dinner time, and there might be a wait for seating.

        We visited Musashi Japanese Steakhouse, located in Gainesville,
        Virginia.


        This Japanese steakhouse features Hibachi cooktop cooking in front of
        guests and an extremely versed sushi menu. We have eaten here several
        times after discovering this restaurant more recently and have had an
        excellent dinner with either Hibachi or sushi. You really can't go wrong
        here with what is on the menu.


        Everything we've had has been very delightful and delicious, and the
        staff is very attentive and courteous.


        On our last visit, I had the Hibachi scallop and fillet, steak fixed
        medium rare with the Hibachi stir fry vegetables and fried rice. We also
        had a couple of sushi rolls to share that came in a little wooden boat,
        much to my delight and surprise.


        I highly recommend this restaurant if you like Japanese hibachi or
        sushi. Beware, though, that this restaurant really fills up around lunch
        and dinner time, and there might be a wait for seating.

        Made a reservation to eat here a few hours in advance. When we showed up
        for our reservation we were told they were "running behind". We ended up
        sitting down to wait and noticed a lot more people showing up. It ended
        up being a situation where it was basically standing room only. We were
        still waiting for our reservation 40 minutes after it was supposed to
        occur (reservation was for 6pm). We tried to go to the front desk and
        inquire however the staff wasn't helpful and didn't respond to our
        inquiries, they didn't seem interested at all. We ended up leaving about
        45 minutes after our reservation time and going somewhere else. Not an
        ideal place on a busy night if you expect to sit down in a timely manner
        or if you have a reservation. I won't go back, and won't recommend it to
        anyone we know. It's unfortunate as we had heard it was decent, however
        we didn't get to even try the food. Lastly, Prices for drinks etc seemed
        a little high for the type of items offered. If you're too expensive and
        your service is subpar it's not a winning formula.

        My family has been going here for just about every person's Birthday
        plus a few other times for the last 25 years. So we eat here about 6-8
        times a year. The food and sushi is AMAZING, sauces are incredible! At
        this point I get more excited about other people's birthdays then they
        do! 😆.


        I don't quite understand some of the bad reviews I've read here. It's
        not an in and out real quick restaurant, and there's about 500,000 homes
        within 10 miles of this restaurant which is one of the most popular in
        Gainesville, so we simply avoid holidays as I'm sure service is a little
        slower.


        Everything is good though! Salad, soup, nigiri, hibachi is my order of
        things!

        We had the worst experience at Musashi Japanese Steakhouse today. This
        is the kind of sushi served there and when we shared feedback with the
        owner, he was extremely rude. All 6 sushi rolls had mushy, stale rice
        that was falling apart when we touched it. They were so severely
        understaffed and the waitress was just being run down with waiting
        multiple tables and the Teppanyaki grill so it was not the waitress at
        all, she was super nice. Just looks like terrible ownership who don’t
        like feedback. Stay away from this place, the owner doesn’t care and
        will happily take your money and tell you do whatever you want if you
        share any feedback.

        Absolute art. The sushi chefs are talented with skills that surpass any
        other sushi restaurant I've been too. We had Vegas roll, dragon roll,
        volcano roll, and edamame. Great staff and welcome environment. Watching
        the hibachi chefs was also a blast. Total mouthgasms.
