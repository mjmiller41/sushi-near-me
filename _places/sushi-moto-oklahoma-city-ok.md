        Sushi Moto is one of the best sushi places that I have EVER eaten at.
        It's so good that I drive 2 hours and 30 minutes to Oklahoma City nearly
        EVERY MONTH just to eat here for dinner on a random Friday night! My
        favorites are the Spicy Cowboy, Princess, and Spicy Cajun. 🤤 They are
        MOUTH WATERING GOOD! The Thai tea also hits the spot. I've also had
        other rolls, and they have never done me wrong. I highly recommend that
        everyone try this spot out.

        When we first walked in, we were greated with smiles and great service.
        The stove was best of all but on top of that,   We ordered a spicy
        cowboy and two other rolls.  It was really tasty! I'd recommend getting
        food to go or dine in !

        Absolutely perfect every time. With the lunch special and 2 drinks, it's
        still under 40 dollars. Quality, large pieces of fish were in my poke
        bowl and a healthy amount of cream cheese in my boyfriends fries rolls.

        Sushi Moto was okay for the most part.  The service was great, and the
        sushi was lacking flavor.


        I enjoyed the edamame - cooked very well.  Parking is available, but
        could be packed on lunch hour. There are lunch specials so the total
        amount order doesn't break the bank either.  Feel free to check it out,
        if you'd like something quick.

        Like did not realize that this was the former GoGo Shshi, still the same
        layout, still serving quality sushi at a good price!


        I was in the area working when I realized it was after lunch and I had
        BOGO so I had to stop in.  Luckily for me it was well after the lunch
        rush so basically pretty empty.


        I must admit the rolls I selected were awesome!  The Rock n Roll and the
        Great Gatsby such a great  choice.  I was looking for the Ikura on the
        menu but they didn't offer that so I opted for the Masago Nigiri - a
        suitable substitute.


        I'm flag in stopped in it read will with the visit.  Service was great,
        parking was ample at that time of day and the sushi . . . delicious!  If
        you're a Sushi fan you need to give this place a try!
