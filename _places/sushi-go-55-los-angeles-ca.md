        Lots of good reviews but sadly I did not have a positive experience. I
        am giving 3 stars because i want so badly to like it. The server and
        sushi chef were nice but unfortunately we had a language barrier w our
        waiter which resulted in receiving food with ingredients we voiced we
        could not have. It was also really expensive. $40 for 2 pieces of
        scallop and 2 pieces of massago sashimi.

        A top 3 LA sushi restaurant, probably one of the closest to authentic
        Japanese sushi. Definitley some of the best little Tokyo has to offer.
        The sushi plate was fresh and with subtle flavors in the fish.

        We placed a Togo order for a delightful variety of dishes at this
        Japanese restaurant located in downtown LA. It happens to be one of my
        brother's favorite places, and he was determined to welcome me with a
        special dinner from here, despite the crazy Friday traffic in the area.
        Arriving a little early, we patiently waited for them to open at exactly
        5:00 pm. Since our order was quite substantial, they kindly brought the
        food to our car in the parking structure. My generous brother left a big
        tip for both the waitress and the person who delivered the food. The
        entire family thoroughly enjoyed the meal. I opted for the chirashi,
        which was a generous portion of fresh sashimi, rice, and a variety of
        veggies. It paired perfectly with my niece's favorite beer, Allagash
        Curieux, which I found to be excellent. Later, we also indulged in some
        sake. The gathering was filled with heartwarming conversations and
        scrumptious food, making it a truly cherished moment for all of us. Such
        experiences remind us of the joy of family gatherings and the simple
        pleasures of life.

        We arrived after the lunch rush and was treated to the front-row seat
        right by the chefs. We had been looking forward to this meal after
        finding Sushi Go 55 from our research. We loved how fresh the sushi and
        sashimi’s were, and the servers were warm and attentive. We did have a
        little difficulty finding the restaurant at first. There was a lack of
        obvious signage outside, but the food more than made up for it.
        Definitely going back next time we’re in LA.

        2 hours from start to finish including wait-list. Sorry to say but it
        wasn't worth the wait. Was only 4th on the list but the limited 7 tables
        made the wait over 30 min. Coming from a real Japanese visitor, it
        didn't meet expectations especially from the higher prices being
        charged. Received the wrong nigiri order at first. Only 1 server who can
        speak Japanese couldn't provide all the tables with the proper attention
        that was required. Decent level of authentic sushi in US.
