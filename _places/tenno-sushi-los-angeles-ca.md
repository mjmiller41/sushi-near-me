        Hands down the best sushi we ever had. I had the Bora bora, then the
        pork belly.

        Appetizer

        We had the strawberry soju and it was amazing. I highly recommend this
        place, and I definitely will be back!!! My favorite thing is fresh
        tasted.Great and the portions were large. I don't know about the parking
        because I ubered there.

        Cool sushi place in Little Tokyo, not much waiting. With so many sushi
        restaurants nearby it's hard to compare the sushi taste. We went in at
        noon and got the Hawaiian Poke Salad. It's excellent and very filling.
        It's a little pricey at about $19 but 2 people can share it. There are
        lunch deals too but we didn't try them. Overall, it's a good restaurant,
        cannot say it's better or worse than nearby but at least it's not as
        crowded.

        I was waitlisted a block away at another sushi restaurant, with a
        90-minute wait ahead of me. I was getting “hangry” and could not wait
        any longer. I walked over, and Tenno seated me right away. The sushi is
        simply fantastic and is a solid value. Very friendly and attentive
        service. I got the 12-piece chef’s choice sushi. I was at the sushi bar
        and even had a nice conversation with the sushi chef who prepared my
        meal. Strong recommendation.

        Best sushi happy hour in Little Tokyo. They have a great deal with
        ordering one large beer at regular price ($9.50) and getting a large
        sake for 1 cent! If you’re not a sake drinker, you can simply order the
        HH large kirin / asahi / Sapporo bottl for $6.50. HH hand rolls also
        fare for $6.95, cementing their happy hour value for sushi. Rolls were
        ok but kinda pricey - aka rainbow for $13.95.


        Happy hour goes from 4-7pm Tues-Fri, all day Monday, and Saturday from
        open-4pm. Will definitely come back!

        We went here on a Thursday night at 8 and had no wait and found street
        parking. Street parking was free after 8.


        We were seated right away. After about 34 minutes we were pretty much
        done eating because the food came out super quickly!


        The presentation was beautiful, the sushi was fresh, and the rice was
        still warm!

        The servers were very attentive as well.


        We got the Captain America roll, truffle hunter roll, crunchy roll, and
        a bento box with California rolls and pork katsu.


        The Captain America roll was topped with a PILE of tempura shrimp chunks
        and a yummy sweet and creamy sauce. The truffle hunter roll was yummy
        also with the truffle oil coming through. The bento box was large and 1
        entree would’ve been enough.


        The sushi was a great value for money. I’ve been to Japan, omakase, and
        many sushi restaurants and I was very impressed. Too bad I’m from out of
        town or else I would come here again!
