        I absolutely love this sushi spot! It's become a cherished tradition for
        my dad and me to visit, and we always leave feeling satisfied and happy.
        The quality of the food is consistently impressive, from the
        melt-in-your-mouth otoro to the fresh, flavorful salmon. Every bite is a
        delight, showcasing the skill and care that goes into each dish. The
        atmosphere is also inviting, making it a perfect place to enjoy a meal
        together. I highly recommend coming here if you're looking for top-notch
        sushi—it's truly a gem!

        I absolutely love this sushi spot! It's become a cherished tradition for
        my dad and me to visit, and we always leave feeling satisfied and happy.
        The quality of the food is consistently impressive, from the
        melt-in-your-mouth otoro to the fresh, flavorful salmon. Every bite is a
        delight, showcasing the skill and care that goes into each dish. The
        atmosphere is also inviting, making it a perfect place to enjoy a meal
        together. I highly recommend coming here if you're looking for top-notch
        sushi—it's truly a gem!

        So disappointed. I won’t be returning back to matsuri. All started with
        our waitress displaying a noticeable lack of enthusiasm. She avoided eye
        contact and seemed bothered by our presence, making us feel
        uncomfortable

        When the food arrived we discovered a long black hair in one of the
        sushi pieces.

        When we politely asked our waitress to remove the contaminated sushi and
        bring the check, she seemed put off. To our surprise, she still charged
        us for the entire meal, minus only one sushi piece which we didn’t touch
        nor drink anything as we wanted to leave.

        Unfortunately, Matsuri has taken a significant step backward. The
        decline in service quality and attention to detail is striking. Unless
        they revamp their service standards, I would not recommend Matsuri to
        others.

        I have always wanted to try this place. My husband suggested it. It was
        amazing. Every dish was delicious and surprising. We ate everything and
        then ordered dessert. My favorite was The Invitation to the White House.
        Lightly charred, fragrant sesame seeds, tender fish, so good. We will
        make this a regular spot!

        Amazing food and service. See photos for what we chose. Wait times were
        a bummer though. We were told that for a table of 2 it’d be ~40min. A
        bit too long but we decided to wait. It then took 52min. The restaurant
        is very small. Service on the table was amazing, the hostesses in the
        front though weren’t too friendly. A bit of empathy with people waiting
        for so long would be nice. Also recommend the miso soup. It was
        delicious.

        I recently had the pleasure of dining at Matsuri and it was an
        incredible experience. Despite the fact that the restaurant was packed,
        there was plenty of parking available in the lot adjacent to the
        building.


        The standout feature of my meal was the incredibly fresh fish and
        seafood. Everything was expertly prepared and beautifully presented. I
        especially enjoyed the sushi, which was some of the best I've had in a
        long time.


        However, what really made the experience memorable was the outstanding
        service provided by Jessy. She was friendly, knowledgeable, and
        attentive throughout the meal, making excellent recommendations and
        ensuring that we had everything we needed.


        Overall, Matsuri is a must-visit for anyone who loves sushi and Japanese
        cuisine. With plenty of parking available and excellent service from
        Jessy, it's the perfect spot for a special occasion or a night out with
        friends.
