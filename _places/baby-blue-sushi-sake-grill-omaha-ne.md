        My wife and I came here for our weekly date night. This was a new
        restaurant that we haven’t been to as this is tradition, when we go out
        for dinner. Upon entering, we are greeted with a smile and are quickly
        seated. Our waitress was gregarious and promptly delivered water. I have
        no complaints except I wish that the mango sauce that came with the crab
        Rangoon was a little more, substantial. The price was fair, and the
        service wasn’t too bad. 😊

        Excited for the coming renovations!!!


        Blue Sake Sushi is hands-down one of the best sushi spots we’ve been to,
        and our experience was made even better thanks to our incredible server,
        Madeline! From start to finish, she made sure we were well taken care
        of, offering great recommendations and keeping the atmosphere fun and
        welcoming. It’s rare to find service that’s as attentive and friendly as
        Madeline’s, and it truly made our visit memorable.


        One of the highlights was their all-day Sunday happy hour – an absolute
        win! The selection was fantastic, with delicious sushi, creative
        appetizers, and drink specials that made it easy to try a little of
        everything. Every dish we tried was fresh, beautifully presented, and
        full of flavor. Blue Sake Sushi really nails it on quality and variety,
        and the happy hour made it an incredible value as well.


        If you’re looking for a place that combines excellent food, a lively
        atmosphere, and top-notch service, look no further than Blue Sake Sushi.
        Thanks to Madeline and the whole team for a wonderful dining experience
        – we’ll definitely be back soon!

        Oh my YUMMMMMM!!


        If you're a fan of sushi 🍣 than this stop is a MUST. The service was
        stellar, and the food was even better 😋 👌🏻


        My husband got the thriller sushi roll (he's not a huge fish guy - but
        loves to try the cooked items or fried items and to accommodate my love
        for seafood and sushi). It was a hint of spicy with a touch of shrimp 🍤
        flavoring, I initially thought of curry when I tried it.


        My selection this evening was the miso soup and tuna tower, and it was
        delightful. *Check out the photos as I'm not a great how to explain it.
        Think of a deconstructed sushi roll in a tower of amazing. Raw tuna,
        tabico, Avocado 🥑 crab mix and rice with sweet sauces on the plate to
        mix around when grabbing bites.

        This is my 2nd visit to Blue Sake. I went to downtown Omaha on my 1st
        visit. And i just know there are another branch in other locations since
        i’m new in Omaha.


        I love all the foods here, though it is corporate restaurant but they
        still keep the quality good!


        Don’t forget to get the Tempura Ice Cream as a dessert.

        We had an awesome experience last night! After our order for the Build
        Your Own Sushi Box somehow didn’t go through (probably our fault) we
        thought we were out of luck and would just have to try it another time,
        but Sean and the chefs came through amazingly and were able to put it
        together for us, saving date night! The box was a ton of fun to make the
        rolls ourselves and the quality was top notch, we would definitely
        recommend it to anyone looking to have a fun night at home trying out
        making your own rolls! Thanks so much for the amazing service and
        delicious food!
