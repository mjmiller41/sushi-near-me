        I had the Valentine’s Day omakase at KIYOMI Sushi by Uchi, and it was an
        incredible experience. Each dish was unique, with amazing flavors and
        beautifully fresh sushi. The presentation was stunning, and you can
        really tell the quality and attention to detail.


        The atmosphere is something to keep in mind—KIYOMI is located in a food
        court, so while I personally didn’t mind, the presence of families and
        kids might make it feel less romantic for some. That said, I absolutely
        loved the emo music playing in the background! Overall, a fantastic meal
        with great vibes—just know what to expect with the setting.

        A friend suggested Kiyomi for lunch, and I’m so glad she did! They have
        an amazing lunch special: a 7-piece omakase for just $40, which also
        includes miso soup and a hand roll. This special was hard to pass up.


        Seating is limited and first come, first served, so we decided to go
        during the week and arrived early to avoid any crowds. There’s only
        counter seating, and they serve each piece of sushi one at a time, which
        really lets you take in the the flavors of the meal. Every piece of
        sushi was fresh, filling, and full of flavor, and the miso soup was the
        perfect complement to the meal.


        If you’re looking for excellent sushi at a great price, check out
        Kiyomi! It's definitely worth the price.

        Chef Uchi is amazing. We knew we had to come to Kiyomi after dining at
        Sushi Nakazawa (where Chef Uchi was previously the executive chef) many
        times over the past several years. As always, the selection of fish did
        not disappoint — only sourced from the best! Technique and flavors were
        all on point. We will definitely be coming back.

        It's a popup for the moment. They will move across the atrium to their
        full time spot in the future. On this day the 16 courses, essentially
        single bites, was overall - solid. Let me expand...


        Fortunately, I've been to quite a few of these sorts of restaurants.
        This place does a good job with most dishes, with a few that were
        excellent. The char sushi were standouts. The other pieces, while good,
        needed more moisture, i.e. each piece needed more of the sauce they
        dressed each piece with. The bed of rice needed to be better saturated
        in that particular sauce.


        Overall, you're likely in for $300+ per couple here, so the review
        reflects the need for a bit more flavor (moisture) in each bite. I think
        this place has potential, but they need to add that extra flavor, which
        at the moment is faint.

        It's legit the best Omakase deal. I've also gotten takeout sushi, and
        it's delicious and high-quality. I need to try the dinner omakase as
        well. Everyone who works there is lovely and great at what they do.
