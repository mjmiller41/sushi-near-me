        What a little gem!  Went here on a whim, and boy, was I pleasantly
        surprised at the quality of the sushi, the service, and attention to
        detail.


        When a sushi place has uni, you know you're in the right place, whether
        you ear it or not.  And they have it.


        The special that day was live scallops, OMG, so good, check out the PIC.


        Their presentations were amazing, and I loved it.


        I would make this my new go-to for sushi, but it is too far away from
        where I live, but if I'm ever in the area, I will definitely stop by.

        Can not say enough about this place. They are friendly, the atmosphere
        is modern, and the food is above average. We always enjoy sitting at the
        sushi bar, where the small tasting is a treat before the mean.


        Highly recommend if shopping the Avenues in East Cobb.

        Sushi was top quality & good. Hibachi was okay & could be better.
        Chicken hibachi was probably the best.  Service was great!!

        I had a belated birthday/anniversary celebration here last night. It was
        my first time dining at Katana and the experience was incredible! Our
        server, Maxine, was extremely pleasant and attentive. The food was
        excellent and exceeded my expectations. I was even surprised with a
        lovely birthday dessert that was absolutely delicious! This is a now
        local favorite restaurant for me.

        Sept 2024 Update below....


        This place needs to be on a tour guide, It's incredible!!

        The service was great!!

        Came in for lunch with my wife and young daughter.  We have eaten sushi
        at hundreds of places and several countries and Katana did not
        disappoint!.

        I believe Jimmy was our server, he was super cool and nice,  was
        attentive.  Our compliments to the sushi chefs as the rolls and
        individual sushi tasted fresh and delicious!! The edamame and soup were
        awesome.  We'll definitely be going back. Thanks again!


        ...Update April 2024.

        Went back a few days ago with the family.  It was missed! Again
        incredible service and absolutely Top Top food.  Everything was
        incredible!!

        My son ordered Chicken nuggets and fries,  who knew they had that!!,
        then my son was feeling like he wanted to try some of what we were
        having and he ordered a Shrimp Soba and he loved it!!!!!. So happy to
        have this place only minutes from us. Everyone there is incredible and
        always smiling and treated us like Royalty!


        Update Sept 2024

        Went back with the family. Ordered many of the same rolls we've always
        gotten and enjoyed.

        Right away, we noticed that the rolls were a miniature version of the
        rolls we've had every other time we've been there.


        Smaller in size and pieces. But same prices


        Then I ordered my usual 4 pieces of Unagi.... they arrived and were
        easily Half the size of the last time we were here.

        The desserts were loved by all but time to try another place.
