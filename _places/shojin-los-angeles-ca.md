        My wife and I first visited this restaurant seven years ago, and we
        decided to return because we had such a memorable experience. This time,
        we tried the Shojin November tasting menu (a 10-course offering), and it
        did not disappoint. The menu was incredibly creative, featuring a
        delightful variety of dishes and flavors.


        Two standout dishes for us were the button mushroom and the tempura
        banana with chocolate mousse—both absolutely blew our minds! The service
        was warm and attentive, and the staff went the extra mile by taking a
        photo for us and even arranging a small birthday celebration.


        Overall, this is a wonderful, upscale restaurant that’s perfect for
        special occasions. We highly recommend stopping by if you’re looking for
        a place to celebrate or enjoy an exceptional dining experience.

        My wife and I first visited this restaurant seven years ago, and we
        decided to return because we had such a memorable experience. This time,
        we tried the Shojin November tasting menu (a 10-course offering), and it
        did not disappoint. The menu was incredibly creative, featuring a
        delightful variety of dishes and flavors.


        Two standout dishes for us were the button mushroom and the tempura
        banana with chocolate mousse—both absolutely blew our minds! The service
        was warm and attentive, and the staff went the extra mile by taking a
        photo for us and even arranging a small birthday celebration.


        Overall, this is a wonderful, upscale restaurant that’s perfect for
        special occasions. We highly recommend stopping by if you’re looking for
        a place to celebrate or enjoy an exceptional dining experience.

        The most delicious and intimate dinner. The food was exceptional. We
        ordered from the Valentine’s Day fixed menu. The service was amazing and
        we were treated like the only guests in the restaurant.


        I will say that this was the most expensive meal of my life, but also
        one of the best.

        Amazing! It was my first time dining here and came after being
        recommended from a few people. Service was perfect. We got the omakase
        and everything was so well thought out and delicious.  The timing of
        every course was perfect and well presented. It felt like a fine dining
        experience, but with more warmth. Not stuffy or uncomfortable in any
        way. I appreciate that they even went above expectations for my friends
        birthday that we were celebrating.

        Best Japanese vegan fine dining experience in LA. Definitely recommend
        and worth the money spent. The service was amazing from the starting to
        the end. We went for our anniversary celebration and they made our day
        perfect. I will give more than 5stars if possible.
