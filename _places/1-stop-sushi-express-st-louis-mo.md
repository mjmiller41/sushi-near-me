        I placed an order through Uber eats. I ordered spicy salmon roll

        Crab Rangoon

        Oshinko roll (pickled vegetables)

        Miso soup

        Spicy octopus roll


        The overall quality of each roll was not that great compared to other
        sushi restaurants I've ordered from. The spicy rolls were not spicy and
        the texture was too chewy. The miso soup looked, smelled and tasted old
        but the crab Rangoon was pretty good, as it didn't have the overwhelming
        cream cheese flavor like most chain restaurants serve.  I will give this
        place one more try in the future, earlier in the day, since I ordered in
        the evening when I'm sure the store was preparing to close.

        The BEST sushi! And the friendliest workers (owners?). The food is
        always delicious, hot, and fresh when we pick up. Also love the calamari
        and veggie tempura appetizers!


        Would highly recommend to anyone and everyone.

        Sushi 🍣 is great!! I ordered a Veg-G, Philly and Touchdown roll.  Good
        quality at a great price.  I would absolutely order any of these again.
        I love that the veggie roll is loaded with more than just cucumber and
        carrots. It has cucumber, avocado, asparagus, pickled radish, kampyo &
        sprouts!  The touchdown roll was fantastic!!!! A crunchy, tasty kick
        with spicy yellowtail, cream cheese, jalapeno, cilantro, masago,
        scallions, spicy mayo, wasabi mayo & eel sauce at a bargain price of
        10.99.

        It's a carryout place, a "hole in the wall," so to say. The atmosphere
        is as good as you would expect for walking in to grab your togo order.
        Food is well packaged. Polite worker, too!

        Worth the wait! My wife and I were so excited to find that they opened
        so close to us. Love having them in the neighborhood. The owners were so
        kind and the sushi was fresh and delicious. We got the nigiri special, a
        red dragon roll, golden dragon roll, and the kabocha tempura.

        Pleasantly surprised at the quality of ingredients and generous portion
        sizes! I ordered through GrubHub.


        I typically order for multiple days. I got the shrimp tempura, miso
        soup, a jalapeño-tuna appetizer, Sake Don bowl, and Sweet Wonder roll.


        The shrimp tempura also comes with vegetables and was the heaviest of
        the boxes. Probably 20 pieces of shrimp and vegetables, plus dipping
        sauce. The batter was sweet and tasty.


        The miso soup was nice and strong, not watery like I've had elsewhere. I
        could have eaten a quart of it.


        The jalapeño-tuna appetizer was just the perfect level of spiciness,
        with spicy mayo, wasabi mayo, Sriracha, tuna, all in a hollowed-out
        jalapeño. I love the kick of all those sauces, but wisely saved most of
        it for another day so I wouldn't get heartburn.


        The Sweet Wonder roll is my favorite sushi roll in all of St. Louis.
        It's absurdly large in diameter--since I was eating at home, I stopped
        trying to use chopsticks and picked it up. The crab, salmon, avocado,
        and cream cheese go just perfectly together.


        The Sake Don is in my fridge untouched, but certainly looks delicious.
        It's salmon on sushi rice with sprouts. I have no doubt it will be
        tasty.


        I thought I'd have enough for 2-3 meals but it's likely double that,
        which makes this an extremely good value. Hooray for affordable sushi!
