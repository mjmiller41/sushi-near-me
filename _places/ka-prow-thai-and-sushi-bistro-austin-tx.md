        Staff were really nice and friendly. The restaurant was clean and nicely
        decorated. The food arrived quickly and it was nice to receive a
        complimentary salad. My pad see ew was good but it was on the salty side
        and didn’t have the sweetness I expect from Thai food. The salad didn’t
        taste very fresh but it was free. The portions were generous and I
        overall enjoyed my meal.

        We just ordered some of the sushi for pickup. It was TERRIBLE.
        Unfortunately, the restaurant is now closed for the night, so we can't
        take it back. But if we could, I would. There was a lot wrong with the
        sushi, but a few things really stood out:

        - There was a foul, rancid taste to the crab in the spider roll. Not
        sure if it was burned, or if its gone off. I guess I'll report back if
        we get sick or not.

        - The spicy tuna is BROWN. See photo. This is not fresh. Unfortunately,
        one of my dining partners actually ate a few pieces before I saw it.
        Here's hoping he doesn't get sick.

        - The spicy crab roll is just a mess. The mayo is unseasoned and the
        crab topping is just everywhere. It looks nothing like the photo on the
        website. See for yourself.


        Avoid at all costs. Truly the worst sushi I've had in Austin. $70 worth
        of sushi went straight into the trash.

        A tasty family owned restaurant. Service is quick and amazing. I have
        been there many times and when the owners recognize me they immediately
        serve me Thai tea. Nothing bad to say!

        This place is incredible!! Went here for dinner last night on a whim and
        it was so amazing we ended up coming back today for more! Service is
        awesome, all the servers are super nice and helpful with
        recommendations, very attentive to allergies and food preferences. The
        atmosphere was wonderful, tonight they even had live music (a guy
        playing piano)! All the food we’ve gotten has been so super flavorful
        and perfect portions. We’re not from Austin but definitely will stop
        here whenever we are in the area in the future because this was just
        phenomenal.


        (They also have a fish tank and the fish are so pretty and make me
        happy.)
