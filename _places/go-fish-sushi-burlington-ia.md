        First experience at this restaurant. I had heard a lot of good things
        and overall they lived up to the hype. I was pleased to find out they
        weren't as expensive as I had been led to believe. The quality and
        portion size was worth the cost. Plain rolls were as low as $5 with
        specialty rolls as high as $20. The seared steak roll was massive and
        delicious. The crab rangoon roll was very good (they use imitation crab)
        and the old smokey roll was good but the hickory smoke flavor was tad
        overwhelming for me. The dynamite shrimp was... Well, dynomite! Lol.
        Worth the trip but will prolly do take-out next time.

        Lunch is take out only. Special rolls were out of thos world! The spicy
        mayo is more spicy than I'm used to but very good and tolerable in
        little bits. Took more time than I expected but well worth the wait.
        Reasonable prices. Small dining room and comfortable.  Clean!!

        I was disappointed with the rice used for the food. It's apparent that
        sugar was added to the rice to sweeten it, which takes away from the
        simple, clean, and savory flavor you expect from sushi. The sweetness
        overpowers any other flavor, so much it was gross. Sugar on my fish is
        the last thing I want. Doesn't really taste like sushi with the rice so
        sweet. It kind of ruined the experience for my wife and I, and cravings
        were not sated.


        If I wanted to eat sugar I'd go anywhere else for food. Pretty
        dissapointing flavor, especially for the price. Wish I hadn't ordered as
        much as I did, but this is the only sushi I've ever eaten with sweet
        rice, and I've eaten a lot of sushi in my life. 90 bucks down the drain
        with the 5 rolls we had ordered. The Miso soup was good, but rice is
        about 70% or more of the food makeup on the menu.

        Have had dinner here many times and each time, we've had a wonderful
        meal.  My hubby likes the beef & reef (left) and I tried a new one, sumo
        salmon(right) I loved it, wonderful flavor. If you like salmon, it's a
        most try there!

        I’m soooo picky when it comes to sushi but these guys really hit the
        nail on the head!! From the appetizer, to the sushi, to the entree
        everything was AMAZING. The top dogs Ryne and Mason have amazing
        customer service. I really cannot recommend this place enough! If you’re
        thinking about trying it- do it! You won’t be sorry. Definitely the best
        sushi within at least 50 miles of Burlington
