        The past two decades have particularly shaped my view of Japanese
        cuisine. The trips to Tokyo, Kobe, Osaka, and Sapporo/Hokkaido truly
        changed my understanding of Japan, their people, and especially their
        cuisine. I became even more particular when I became close friends with
        a Japanese sushi chef of three decades - a true shokunin. So it
        shouldn’t be of surprise that I’ve became severely biased against
        non-Japanese owned/run (especially when it comes to
        sushi/sashimi/yakitori) restaurants. It shouldn’t be of any surprise
        considering that over these decades I’ve also observed undesired
        shortcuts and inferior techniques that are quite upsetting due to the
        contradiction to the art itself.


        However, this may be one of the few exceptions - one of very, very few
        that I’d ever openly admit to.


        I first tried this place almost two years ago after reading about them
        on Eater Boston while originally searching for a reputable omakase spot
        in the area. I was curious. The name itself was already a giveaway that
        they weren’t Japanese owned. But I couldn’t resist the temptation to
        just even partake and see what they were made of. And I honestly was
        happy I even gave them a chance.


        As always, there were always methods that I turn to for assessing
        restaurants. Here, I usually would either order a chirashi (to quickly
        see the range of their fish and freshness) or a tekkamaki (a staple and
        standard). And within the same week, I ordered both and more. I was
        really curious as the range of fish they delivered on the plate was
        absolutely fresh. Sure, I always have mixed feelings when I see a piece
        or two of escolar on the plate. Obviously, I still ate it…but as the
        last piece and only if all the other slices were immaculate. But when I
        saw their tekkamaki as it arrived, I smiled. They know what they are
        doing. They really do.


        Perhaps, one of the good things about being a slightly cheaper sushi
        spot is the turnover as the fish will always be fresher on your plate.
        And in this case, a rare exception to the general rule, cheap isn’t
        exactly cheap on what you get. It might just be because it is also the
        culture of the group behind this masterpiece. Cheaper means
        accessibility that even groceries nowadays make us think twice. And they
        are willing to just do it for the sake of driving traffic in through the
        doors and be ambassadors for a now much-loved cuisine that often becomes
        quickly too expensive for the regular folk (for reference, I average
        $80-150 before drinks alone elsewhere).


        All those words and all I really wanted to say is…they are non-Japanese
        and they have broken my bias and made me a regular. Also to Vicky, who
        has always providing absolutely amazing service, thank you and see you
        around soon. Best wishes to all the staff and the restaurant itself.
        Cheers.

        The past two decades have particularly shaped my view of Japanese
        cuisine. The trips to Tokyo, Kobe, Osaka, and Sapporo/Hokkaido truly
        changed my understanding of Japan, their people, and especially their
        cuisine. I became even more particular when I became close friends with
        a Japanese sushi chef of three decades - a true shokunin. So it
        shouldn’t be of surprise that I’ve became severely biased against
        non-Japanese owned/run (especially when it comes to
        sushi/sashimi/yakitori) restaurants. It shouldn’t be of any surprise
        considering that over these decades I’ve also observed undesired
        shortcuts and inferior techniques that are quite upsetting due to the
        contradiction to the art itself.

        Your new favorite sushi spot!

        This place is so good. Service is excellent. It’s an adorable spot with
        a few tables and a few bars seats. Everything is delicious, super fresh,
        elegant, and their special rolls are really good - best in Boston

        Really fresh sushi and sashimi/Japanese food! Enjoyed all our orders.
        Personal fav was spicy salmon maki. They also offer daily special sushi.
        The one we got was fatty tuna with scallop. It’s great and we also got
        sashimi deluxe and they were so fresh! Will always be back to get more.
        It gets crowded pretty fast and small space here

        This is easily the best, no nonsense sushi place I've been to around
        boston. It's unpretentious and the food is generous, delicious, and
        beautifully presented. Service is attentive but not obtrusive. Perfect.

        The best sushi restaurant around. Highly recommended. Came here on a
        Friday night and although they don't take reservations for smaller
        groups we were seated right away.


        Service was great and the fish was very fresh.
