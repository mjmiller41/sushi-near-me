        We found this place to dine at while passing through Boise. It has a
        really nice atmosphere and is well decorated. They were very busy, so
        the wait for food took awhile. The service was decent though! I had the
        double shrimp roll. The tempura shrimp was crispy and the ebi (cooked
        shrimp) was fresh. It was good! My husband had the tuna poke bowl which
        was really fresh and well seasoned. He chose to include both mangoes and
        avocado, and it was the right choice. It also came with rice, miso soup,
        and seaweed salad. Overall a recommended place to get sushi and poke
        bowls or just dinner! They seem to allow pick up or “drive through”
        orders as well where someone will come out to your car to get the order
        and pass you the order.

        A quiet, comfortable little place! There were a few people already there
        when my friend and I arrived, but we were seated immediately and
        received just as much attention and care as the other customers. Ever
        employee we interacted with was above and beyond, incredibly
        understanding and patient, and just overall friendly! They complimented
        my friends earrings and would laugh with us at our jokes - not only did
        they do their job extremely well, but we also felt so welcomed. The food
        was sooooo delicious - we ordered multiple different kinds of items and
        none of them were disappointing at all! The pictures I've included are
        from after we had been eating for a while, I just forgot to take them
        right away haha! Very reasonably priced, wonderful food, wonderful
        people, wonderful atmosphere, wonderful time!!

        I have eaten here for a few years regularly now, the quality has always
        been consistent and I’m still finding new things I like on the menu.
        Prices are very reasonable. Really good ramen. The staff are All
        friendly and welcoming. They recently added more room as they’ve gained
        popularity. These people deserve their success 👍✨

        We tried island sushi and ramen on a whim while traveling through Boise
        and were so pleased with every aspect. Our server Jenny was very
        welcoming and incredibly helpful in offering suggestions for both ramen
        and sushi. The restaurant was not crowded at all, which Jenny said was
        unusual for a Friday night. I guess we chose a good night to dine. We
        ended up order for sushi rolls: spicy hot, the crunch, Yellowstone and
        one more whose name escapes me. And then we split a bowl of ramen. They
        were all gorgeous and delicious! The portions were generous and a
        typical (reasonable) couple probably couldn’t have finished all of it.
        We just happened to be really hungry and left stuffed. The prices were
        very affordable compared to other sushi restaurants in the area that
        we’ve been to. We look forward to being able to return again soon.

        Went in on Easter for a friend's birthday and had the best time! Amazing
        sushi rolls, top tier service and the music playlist was so good, all of
        my group couldn't stop talking about it. I'm so happy to see they are
        doing well and expanded to fit more seating. Less wait times to be
        seated is always a good thing.


        Can't wait to go back!!
