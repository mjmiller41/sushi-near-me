        Very delicious sushi restaurant on Randall Road in Batavia. We visited
        on Saturday evening and the place was packed. We waited very long for
        our sushi, but management was very nice and even brought us free
        appetizers twice. So even though the weight was very long they were very
        nice and accommodating. The sushi is delicious, the drinks are very good
        and the prices are really not bad compared to other places nowadays.
        Highly recommend.

        Had a really nice dinner here a few weeks back. The sushi was very nice
        and fresh, they had many options and selections which was a refreshing
        experience so deep in the boonies. it was fun to both watch them make
        the rolls and check out the lil robo delivering everyone’s order 🤖. The
        staff were also nice, and would happily make you suggestions based on
        what you are in the mood for or what’s a super hit and fav. Their salad
        was just amazing a 5 star on its own. Although I was super disappointed
        by their fried rice, it was just quick hojpoj of white rice with some
        veggies shrimp and soy spice with their steam riced. I would recommend
        this place but avoid the FR.

        Outstanding experience.  Sushi super fresh.  Was a great surprise during
        our visit to Geneva.  Also love the modern touch added to this
        restaurant with the robot servers and dry ice to add a visual element to
        their sushi.  Also nice how they bring complementary samples of items to
        try to the table.

        I love this restaurant so much. The service is amazing. May was my
        server the last time I was there. She’s the greatest! So kind and
        thoughtful and makes the experience so much more special. I am a loyal
        swordfish sushi customer. Highly recommend the baby shark roll, banana
        tempura, & house sake.

        My server was amazing she made great suggestions, was really genuinely
        kind and attentive, she also gave me complementary sushi piece
        “sunshine” and was AMAZING ! The “super white truffle oil” was delicious
        🤤. The blue fin toro roll was also crazy good. I am a big sushi fan and
        I do recommend this place.
