        1. Food Quality (4.5): This is an excellent sushi place for the price. I
        recommend the unagi Roll. While it's not going to be a mind blowing
        experience, it's a hidden gem here. It's definitely the best casual food
        at MGM.


        2. Service (4): You need to order at a kiosk, which is slow and
        inconvenient, but it's feasible during lunch hours. Ideally, there would
        be a mobile card reader, so it's possible to order at the sit -down
        area. Otherwise, the service is good


        3. Food Safety (4): Allergens are not clearly listed anywhere.
        Otherwise, this place is good


        4. Value for Money (5): The value for the meal, considering the
        location, is fantastic! The eel roll was $12-15, with tip.


        5. Convenience (5): This is a fast casual restaurant. It's fast and
        flexible, you can take the dish to your room or to the tables nearby.


        6. Ambiance (3): It's a sit down bar surrounded by other shops, so not
        much of an ambiance.


        Unique Value: This is a fast casual place with great food for the money.
        Definitely recommended.

        1. Food Quality (4.5): This is an excellent sushi place for the price. I
        recommend the unagi Roll. While it's not going to be a mind blowing
        experience, it's a hidden gem here. It's definitely the best casual food
        at MGM.


        2. Service (4): You need to order at a kiosk, which is slow and
        inconvenient, but it's feasible during lunch hours. Ideally, there would
        be a mobile card reader, so it's possible to order at the sit -down
        area. Otherwise, the service is good

        I've been to a number of sushi spots in the DMV and this one NEVER
        disappoints!! Being located at the MGM, I understand the upcharge,
        considering the quality of the sushi, I don't mind paying!! Like pizza
        dough, the base matters. In this case, the rice (and protein) is ALWAYS
        fresh and doesn't taste gummy! Also, the rice-to-protein ration is
        perfect. I don't feel like I'm eating a rice ball with a little piece of
        fish in the middle. It's worth the trip. Please don't ever
        change!!!!!!!!!

        I've only been here once, so try to keep that in mind as you read this
        review. I ordered the salmon skin roll and the volcano roll. As far as
        flavor, they were both ok. Not bad, but not great either. The ginger was
        in large pieces that I felt should've been much smaller. The wasabi was
        very spicy, just the way I prefer.


        I feel like the thing I disliked the most was the level of service. They
        weren't disrespectful at all, but it was painfully obvious that they
        couldn't care less about customer satisfaction. I waited 10 minutes
        after finishing my meal before one of the sushi chefs asked if I was
        done; I was in plain view of both of the other staff members. I even
        tried to make my intentions obvious by piling things on my plate (empty
        soda can, used napkins, chopsticks, etc.). When I got up to walk to the
        opposite side of the bar to pay, the woman was literally leaning on the
        register and taking her sweet time taking orders and payments from other
        customers.


        That said, I'm not recommending that people avoid this sushi bar. If I'm
        ever in the building and I feel like sushi, MAYBE I'll stop again. If
        I'm at the Harbor, I'll go somewhere else. I definitely won't make a
        special trip to go back to Bento Sushi again.

        I have to say that this was quite a surprise. We came here right before
        they closed and they were still able to get our order in. It took a
        minute because there were other people ordering online (Note to self- if
        you don't want to wait, put your order in inline for pick-up). They did
        give us our miso soup and seaweed salad first so we munched on those.
        The soup was hot and had plenty of tofu. The seaweed salad was very
        refreshing. I had the Unagi bowl which was surprisingly a big portion
        considering their rolls weren't as big. It was good my husband ordered
        two rolls, spicy tuna and california roll. The spicy tuna was good but
        the california roll was just amazing! They had real crab meat in the
        roll and not just the imitation crab so it was definitely a nice
        surprise. The prices weren't cheap but it is on the Harbor (inside MGM)
        so I would say it was pretty fair. Highly recommend and will definitely
        be back!
