        To start, the restaurant smells like a dive bar bathroom. In retrospect
        that should have been enough of a red flag. But my main grievance is the
        laughably absurd portions of fish included in their rolls which are
        priced comparably with decent sushi places in, say, Chicago. The rainbow
        roll was not as advertised, only had some white fish on the top and the
        most meager fillet of eel inside. If you’re in Fairfield and craving
        sushi, cook a cup of rice and drizzle some fish sauce on it—you’ll save
        about $30, taste more fish, get the same amount of rice, and hopefully
        won’t have to smell a filthy toilet while you do it.

        I’ve been coming here for years and it is my favorite. The owner does a
        great job of mixing it up with awesome specials and some of the freshest
        fish to be found.

        I had a very enjoyable experience here. I was seated in a timely manner.
        The environment was clean and there were a medium amount of people
        present in various booths and tables. Not too busy, and not too empty.
        The menu was very clear and easy to understand, with many choices of
        food items ranging from appetizers, sides, meals, rolls, drinks, and
        desserts. Once I ordered there was a short wait for my food, not too
        short, but also not too long. Being by myself gave me time to appreciate
        the ambiance and see that the wait staff were very skilled in taking
        care of customers. My food tasted great, and checking out was very
        simple.

        Not returning. My family and I arrived about 5:45pm for my birthday. We
        ordered simple easy food to make. One sushi roll, sashimi, chicken wings
        and dumplings. The service lacks adequate coverage to accommodate a
        large crowd of guests in the restaurant. It took 45 minutes to get a
        Godzilla Roll and sashimi. Another 20 minutes goes by and the remainder
        of our food had still not showed up. We were told by the waitress that
        the remainder of our meal would be right up when my roll and sashimi
        showed up. Disappointed with the service my family and I left. The
        waitress had the nerve to ask my parents to pay for the entire meal even
        though we did not have the rest of our food. It seemed reluctant that we
        only paid for what we were served. Atmosphere is too packed. Not enough
        space to get around tables. Their previous location had adequate seating
        and service. The bar got better service than the rest of the restaurant.
        Never again.

        PROS:

        1. Great sushi for a small town in Iowa

        2. Food generally meets and sometimes exceeds expectations


        CONS: (Measuring against their own best standards)

        1. Service is inconsistent. Has been great and mediocre.

        2. While the food is good, it isn't always great.


        I could have gone 5 stars purely from the perspective of good Sushi in
        Southeast Iowa. Where else are you going to get this? Ottumwa? Mt.
        Pleasant? No way.


        But I think that Shokai could execute more consistently.

        I will continue to go back when I visit FF.
