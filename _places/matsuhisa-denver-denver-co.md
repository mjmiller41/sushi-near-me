        We were originally heading to Matsuhisa in Vail. When that didn't pan
        out, we decided to head to Matsuhisa in Denver. Very glad we did. From
        the moment we walked in, we were greeted very friendly, and lead to our
        table. We started off with their light and palate enriching mixed
        greens, with their own Matsuhisa dressing. We also added the cucumber
        sunomono, which again, was perfect, and exactly what we were looking for
        to start the meal. Then a series of Daily Special appetizers came; the
        lobster ceviche, the tri-color cauliflower with jalapeno and serrano
        sauce, and the spicy tuna with crispy rice. I could eat just the
        appetizers for dinner! All the items were just as scrumptious as you see
        in the attached pictures! If I only had a larger stomach to eat each of
        them twice! For the main course, we did order the Sushi Combo; wanting
        to try a little of everything. They did  not disappoint! The sushi is
        among the freshest I've ever had, and it just equates the deliciousness
        to the start of the meal. We finished off with their Miso-Butterscotch
        Shaved Ice. I have to admit, I hesitated on the pairing of the sauce,
        and was glad I got passed that original thought, and had it! It was the
        perfect ending to the meal. It was light, sweet, but not too sweet - as
        it was balanced by the miso, and just perfect. Rianna, our server, was
        perfect in timing, every time, every plate. Not too early, not too late.
        Every step of the course was meticulously timed, and it showed. I
        absolutely enjoyed my experience at Matsuhisa in Denver, and glad that I
        didn't have to trek to Vail to get the same!Thank you, Matsuhisa Denver,
        for a fantastic experience! I'd definitely recommend to anyone seeking
        sushi for the day. Try it out! You never know! Happy eating!

        This place was insane!! Easily one of the best meals I’ve had in Denver.
        Yes, it’s definitely on the pricey side, but in my opinion, it’s worth
        every penny. The ingredients were incredibly fresh and high quality, the
        flavors were complex yet beautifully balanced, and the service was
        flawless from start to finish. The restaurant itself is also beautifully
        designed, giving high-end and sultry.


        I’d go all the time if my wallet could keep up!

        We came in for the Omakase experience and it did not disappoint!
        Everything was sublime. Our sushi chef Matsuh was amazing and our server
        Jessica was absolutely incredible. Highly recommend this to anyone
        looking for the best sushi experience Denver has to offer.

        Probably the fanciest sushi 🍣 place at Denver. Front desk didnt work
        perfectly, I we celebrated a birthday, and let them know. Needed to
        remind again. And a compliment we got an extremely staled macaroon,
        instead to put the candle on our dessert as I asked.  But overall great
        experience, and wonderful wine list

        Been here twice. The first time was amazing, so I booked this restaurant
        again for my birthday. However the second time was disappointing.

        The hot dishes came out fast enough but between the hot dishes and our
        large sushi order it was a wait of 40+ minutes.

        This is a bit awkward to say but you know how sometimes someone talks to
        you and accidentally lands a spittle on your face? It happened with our
        sever so for the rest of the night I was anxious that some spit would
        get on my food when they introduce the food.

        What really made me realize I’m not coming back was the dessert. I got
        the cherry blossom green tea tiramisu. The tiramisu came with two
        macarons- a matcha and a chocolate one. The chocolate one came with a
        hole on it (?) so i didn’t fully include it in the photo. The macarons
        were super dry and flavorless (both flavors tasted the same)- they were
        worse than grocery store macarons. In fact they taste like grocery store
        macarons that have been out too long and expired. Husband took a bite
        and was also surprised at how dry and flavorless they are - you cannot
        distinguish any “chocolate” or “matcha” flavor.

        The rest of the tiramisu was good.

        Both times we spent around $400. At this price range I think it’s
        reasonable to expect some level of care such as not getting old dry
        macarons (one of which came with a hole in the center) . As the
        finishing dish of the night that’s all we can remember and therefore
        will be seeking another restaurant for future celebrations.
