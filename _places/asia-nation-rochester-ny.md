        I have eaten this type of food up and down the west coast, and across
        the country. I have tried numerous restaurants here in Rochester.  This
        place has the best pork fried rice I have ever eaten. So good, I ordered
        it 2 days straight. Price is reasonable,  portions are large enough to
        have leftovers. Even my wife, who has food concerns, ordered what she
        could eat and raved about it. Highly suggest. Delicious. We will def be
        back and have a nice date dinner here!

        I would prefer to say it was terrible so no one would come and we would
        have the whole place to ourselves but…

        It was a hit… everything we had was great:

        Lettuce wrap appetizer, Beef Udon noodle dish and

        Orange chicken with pineapple and potato (sounds weird but it works).

        Large portions and we needed “to go” boxes… tried hard but couldn’t
        finish it.

        Will definitely be back!

        Stopped in tonight after seeing a movie. Decided to try it after hearing
        a lot of good things, and man the reviews couldn't be more right.
        Everything about our experience was amazing.  We were met by Anna, who
        seated us and also waited on us. She was so very friendly and attentive
        to all of our needs. The food was just absolutely delicious, we has
        their miso soup,  seaweed salad,  pork ramen bowl, and a few house
        special rolls. The portion sizes were much larger than expected.
        Everything was very fresh, and the presentation was just beautiful. 
        During our meal we had the chance to chat with a few other of the staff,
        everyone was super friendly and genuinely happy to be working there.

        We are so glad to have a place like this closer to home. We will
        definitely be back for more. They are already one of our favorite spots,
        try them out and see for yourself!

        My husband liked his meal of beef Friday rice. I got stir fry chicken
        udon. I really don’t like to eat rubbery chicken skin. I don’t know if
        that is what this meal is supposed to be, but I like to eat chicken, not
        skin. That is all skin in the pic.

        Placed an order over the phone, the woman that answered the phone was
        beyond nice and helpful with my questions. I ordered sesame chicken,
        general tso, and mixed vegetables with beef, all with fried rice. The
        fried rice is AMAZING. All of the food was fresh and hot and the flavor
        was better than any Asian style food I’ve ever had. Portion sizes were
        great and I will definitely be ordering from here again soon
