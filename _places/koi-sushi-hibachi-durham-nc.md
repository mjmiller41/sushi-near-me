        First time here last weekend when we came to eat before seeing a show.
        Connie, our server and the manager, was fantastic. Incredibly attentive
        and had an amazing personality. She had us smiling everytime she came to
        our table.

        The food came out quickly and was absolutely delicious, especially the
        house made hibachi sauce. And the price for all you can eat options is
        really fair too!

        We will definitely be back again!

        Where to start? By far the best all you can eat Sushi in the area, I was
        pleasantly surprised with how fast they bring food back after you order,
        SILAS our waiter was a super star, attentive came a few times to make
        sure we were good, the only down side (you can only order 1 salmon
        flower,) I could have had a full plate of those things I mean WOW, the
        place was full but I still feel intimate and in my own space. The price…
        I could not believe when Silas brought my check… got a few sashimi
        pieces and left over charge fee it was under $70.00

        10/10… will definitely go back.

        I placed an order for a Koi Roll and a Yummy Roll, for myself and
        partner. 1st off they packed and smashed 2 different rolls in this small
        container. The rolls look nothing like the pictures. When I called the
        manager she said I should’ve advised them to separate the rolls…. What?

        First time going here! Great sushi, great service , great price, less
        than $25, all you can eat sushi. Vibe is very lively.


        The tea was sweet. The food was fresh, crab salad and miso soup was
        delicious. I got full so fast man. They also have chicken nuggets,
        mozzarella sticks and other sides besides sushi.


        We came to Durham for a show then drove here but we would've def drove
        an hour just to eat here because it was good.


        They don't have military discount but I (we ) were overall satisfied
        with our experience. There was a wait but it was only 23min. The place
        was booming but they didn't slip on service and was also cleaning tables
        for new customers.


        Ok the paper they give you it says you'll be charged like 1.00 or
        something for left overs but at least you can take it home, when we
        asked one of the roles would've been $2.50 so my husband ate it.


        Downside: The bathroom was dirty, the venue is a bit cramped but there
        are tables for parties of 6, maybe more. Parking is terrible but would
        totally recommend! 4.5

        I had an excellent experience at Koi today for lunch, and I'm so glad I
        found this recently opened gem!


        Price/Value: 5/5 The weekday lunch is $15, which would be about the
        price of one specialty sushi roll anywhere else. (Weekend lunch and any
        day for dinner are both $24.) This is an excellent deal, given
        everything we ordered.


        Food: 4/5 The sushi was good, and above what I expected with
        all-you-can-eat. The hibachi was very good, and a generous portion. The
        presentation of every dish is excellent, and the food comes out quickly.
        A word of warning: you will be charged for food not eaten (I believe
        it's 50 cents for each uneaten piece of sushi, not sure how much hibachi
        would be, since we ate it all and ordered even more!)


        Service: 5/5 It's been a while since I've received such kind and
        attentive service! Our drinks were constantly refilled, our orders were
        placed and delivered quickly, and they frequently cleared plates from
        the table as we kept ordering.


        Overall: 4.5/5 Listen, you're not getting M Sushi level quality, but
        you're also paying less for an entire meal than a single roll at M. The
        food is a great value, the service is great, and the price is
        exceptional! I'll definitely be back.
