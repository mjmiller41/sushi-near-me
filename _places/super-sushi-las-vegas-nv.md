        I recently found this place. This is my 2nd time here. We went for
        Tuesday 22 dollars AYCE.It was great. You can not order from all the
        menus, but you have plenty of options . The servers are always nice. I
        love that what you order comes in one plate. Theu do bot mixed all the
        order from the table. Not like other AYCE that they just put everything
        in one plate. Here is all individually serve.

        We have tried most of the AYCE places on the east side, a few in
        Chinatown. This was a new one to hit and it didn’t disappoint. Service
        and atmosphere was great. Fresh fish, nice rice ratio and plenty of
        variety of rolls. Tempura was light, crispy and seasoned well. Miso was
        rich and delicious. Deep fried rolls didn’t have a super thick
        cakey/doughy coating like most places. AYCE price was pretty average. My
        only complaint would be $3 each canned soda. $25 in drinks for 4 seemed
        steep. Overall it was worth the drive and will be back.

        Stopped in on a whim. We wanted to shop for some groceries somewhere
        near our hotel. Parked at the Smiths and saw this sushi restaurant.
        Instead of cooking at the condo, we decided to get some sushi for
        dinner.  Never knew anything about Super Sushi, but when in Vegas...why
        not just try.


        Okay, in all honesty, we wouldn't have picked this spot. For one, it's
        off of a very busy and congested street/area. On Tropicana. And the
        surrounding area isn't the best. We didn't do any research. We just
        Googled "grocery store near me." Not that we are snobs. Actually, we're
        the complete opposite. But, we are mindful and very aware of our
        surroundings.


        "Super Sushi" is a little restaurant tucked in between other businesses.
        It's an AYCE (All You Can Eat) sushi spot. But they also serve ala carte
        and bento style choices if you're not into AYCE. And let me tell you...
        it's DELICIOUS! OISHII! ONO!


        We walked in at about 6 pm. on a Wednesday night. There was only 1
        person sitting at the sushi bar. We were greeted promptly by the
        waitress/server/cashier. Since it was our first time there, she
        explained the difference in AYCE and ala carte ordering.


        For the AYCE, it costs $25.99 to $32.95. The difference if price is a
        section that is, what I assume is on the higher side of cost. However,
        the menu has tons of choices. They also had bento style choices. And you
        could still order off of the sushi menu. You'll just need to  pay for
        each choice.


        We decided on the AYCE. Because one of the bento style choices was
        $16.99 plus any sushi we wanted to order. No brainer. We stayed away
        from the rolls except the avocado roll but inhaled as much negiri as we
        could. Between the Salmon, Unagi, Ahi, Hamachi, and Garlic salmon and
        ahi we ate till our hearts were content. Then followed by shrimp and
        vegetable tempura. But, the best thing I realized is the rice to fish
        ratio. Let me tell you, its so awesome. It's like eating sashimi with a
        tiny amount of rice.


        This is absolutely a must try recommendation to anyone looking for good
        sushi. The staff were friendly and accommodating. The sushi was SUPER
        delicious. I'm definitely going to make it back here again for sushi one
        day.

        An AYCE (all-you-can-eat) sushi restaurant on the west side of the Vegas
        strip on Tropicana Ave.  This small but cozy restaurant serves your
        favorite sushi and sashimi. The dinner price is $25.99 or $32.95 for the
        upgrade which includes specialty options such as sea urchin, nigiri
        sushi, choice of one grilled or one hamachi collar or salmon collar,
        super white tuna collar, etc. Lots of sushi rolls and appetizers to
        choose from the menu. There's plenty of parking in the plaza's parking
        lot. AYCE includes one dessert item. This is one of the least expensive
        AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. Most AYCE sushi restaurant dinner
        price starts at $29.99 and up. Unlike other AYCE sushi restaurants where
        all parties must order all AYCE or all a la carte, this establishment
        allows customers to order la carte and AYCE within the same party. They
        just ask patrons not to share. I like this AYCE restaurant for this
        reason because not everyone in the party wants AYCE. Will return to this
        restaurant for more sushi and sashimi on our next Vegas trip.

        Surprising little gem, the immediate area nearby isn't the best so my
        hopes weren't too high but I'm happy to say I shouldn't have judged this
        book by the cover. Once you go inside it's a complete reversal,
        everything is clean and well kept and the staff is very polite and
        helpful. The food was superb and rolls were gigantic. I wish I had a
        bigger stomach so I could have tried more of their menu as they have
        lots different flavor and ingredient combinations that I haven't really
        seen at other sushi reseraunts. If you're in the area I highly recommend
        giving this little spot a shot, and try their thai green tea!
