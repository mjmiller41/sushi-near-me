        My family and I recently visited this Japanese restaurant for dinner,
        and it was an absolutely delightful experience. For our appetizers, we
        ordered miso soup and seafood soup, both of which were warm, flavorful,
        and perfectly seasoned. Along with the soups, we selected a variety of
        dishes that you can see in the accompanying pictures, each beautifully
        presented and incredibly fresh.


        For the main course, we indulged in a stunning spread of sashimi and
        sushi. The sashimi was expertly sliced, melt-in-your-mouth fresh, and
        paired wonderfully with the accompanying garnishes. The sushi rolls were
        equally impressive, with balanced flavors and immaculate presentation.
        Each bite was a testament to the quality of ingredients and the chef’s
        skill.


        The ambiance of the restaurant added to the overall experience—it was
        cozy yet elegant, with a calm and inviting atmosphere. The staff was
        attentive and knowledgeable, making us feel welcome and ensuring our
        dining experience was seamless.


        If you’re a fan of authentic Japanese cuisine or simply looking for a
        place to enjoy a delicious meal, I can’t recommend this restaurant
        enough. It’s definitely a spot we’ll be returning to!

        Ordered thru GrubHub. Delivery was fine but the sushi? Disgusting! Warm,
        even though it only took the driver 7 minutes to deliver. The salmon was
        crunchy in places; I think it might have been scales? Just a guess, but
        why else would salmon be crunchy? I asked for the rolls to be cut into 8
        pieces each and they were in the standard 6. Smelled very fishy! I know
        it's fish, but good sushi does not smell this strongly. I couldn't
        finish it! 🤢 Also, I ordered a bottled water and the website said it
        would be Perrier. I got a bottle of plain old Poland Springs. Water is
        water but don't advertise something you won't deliver. Gross and
        disappointing!!!


        10 out of 10 do not recommend!

        Benkay is an institution. It's the Japanese staple of Portland. Just
        really good Japanese food. The sashimi quality is top tier.

        We had an amazing lunch at Benkay during our first visit to Portland. We
        love sushi and have tried many sushi restaurants in destinations across
        the country. This is definitely one of our favorites so far! Delicious
        food, great service, relaxed vibes, and price wasn’t bad given the high
        quality. No pics of the sushi - it looked so yummy, we just had to dig
        in!

        I highly recommend visiting at least once. The seafood is incredibly
        fresh, which makes it taste deliciously sweet. The flavor and service
        are top-notch. If you live nearby, it's the kind of taste you'd want to
        enjoy every day.
