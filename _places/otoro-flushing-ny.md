        happy and enjoying! And the vibe is a vibe! Great ambiance and attracts
        great crowd! You won’t regret coming here! Heard they’re opening in
        miami too so have to check that out once it opens Bh!

        Very cute place.  We went on Sunday and it was not very busy.   The
        drinks were light and tasty.  They were a little inconsistent when we
        got the same drink but we loved the cocktails regardless.  Our server
        was very good.  Unfortunately we had to get him few times but he always
        had a wonderful smile which really helped. Our food came fast.  Few
        reminders had to be given but again the waiter was very kind which made
        up for the delays.


        The lobster roll was delicious.  The Korean cauliflower was also great
        fritters to enjoy.  The carpaccio …fried rice…special rolls…so many
        delicious things to eat. We did not enjoy the Beet dish - definitely
        skip that. It didn’t work with rest of stuff.


        Our bill did have 20% tip …even on drinks.


        We went there simply by reading reviews… we had great time.  Should try
        - Great Job

        Where to begin! What an experience… Welcoming decor, attentive staff,
        great cozy upscale vibe, owner a true mensch, and the food, simply
        impeccable and dreamy. Kudos to Isaac and his team for creating such an
        amazing place. For those in NY who wouldn’t normally schlep out to
        Queens, think again…. I would come running back to it every week in a
        perfect world if I could. Seriously - can’t say enough amazing things
        about this place and the quality of the fish. Worth every penny. I have
        been to probably hundreds of sushi restaurants at this point, this is
        top 3, if not the absolute best. Thank you Isaac and the entire Otoro
        team - you guys went above and beyond and we’ll never forget this
        dinner!

        Came here the other night, no words! Owner was so involved and
        passionate about his business. Everything was so perfect, I was amazing
        at the creativity of his multiple sushi chefs and what they were making.

        We ordered the 15 course omakasi which was beyond delicious. The owner
        who is the nicest guy gave us a roll on the house.

        Problem is, once you come here, it’s hard to sit back in economy class:)

        Best of all, pricing was very fair. Highly recommended!!

        Everything at Otoro was incredible. The omakase was buttery and fresh,
        and the flavors across the menu were bold but balanced. Loved the
        Branzino with parsley butter along with the attention to detail in every
        dish. Beautiful space, great energy, with food that seriously delivers.
