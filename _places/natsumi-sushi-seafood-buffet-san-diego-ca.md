        Great sushi and seafood buffet at Natsumi! Large selection of dishes and
        all taste fresh and delicious. Good dessert selection as well. About $30
        per person. Good for a party of any size, they have very large tables.
        Outdoor seating as well. Staff is friendly and quick, cleaning used
        plates so you have more room for another! Recommend!

        This sushi buffet was phenomenal. They had a large and clean dining room
        with enough seats and a great patio. The service was excellent. Their
        sushi was great with a variety of selections. Besides, I liked their
        entrees, fried rice and noodles, soups, and desserts. Their fried
        seafood entrees tasted authentic and decent. I liked their seafood, and
        hot and sour soup the most. Their desserts were also amazing without too
        much sugar. I liked the green tea and coconut pudding. They also had a
        great hibachi bar, but I was completely full. Their lunch was much
        cheaper than dinner, but the lunch items were enough for me. Highly
        recommend this decent sushi buffet.

        Natsumi is a great buffet for the price—the seafood and sushi makes it
        worthwhile. It’s surprisingly fresh and the staff keeps the selection
        well-stocked. It’s definitely one of the better Asian buffets with a
        mixture of Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese dishes. You’ll find
        a vast sushi section with tons of options—tiny poke bowls, endless
        rolls, and plates of sashimi. There is a sushi chef there so they are
        making it fresh throughout the day. The cold seafood bar is always
        stocked with crab legs, shrimp, and oysters. You’ll find different types
        of soups and dumplings—egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, shu mai, etc.
        They also feature a ton of hot dishes like steamed fish, orange chicken,
        beef and broccoli, salt and pepper crab, honey walnut shrimp, fried
        rice, chow mein, and so much more. The staff isn’t particularly the most
        friendly, but I’m always impressed by how diligent they are about
        clearing out your plates as soon as you’re finished with them. It’s not
        fancy, but it’s a solid buffet choice. 10/10 definitely recommend trying
        at least once!

        First and last time there. Food was cold and mediocre. I will say we
        came at 730 or so and they close at 830 so maybe that counts for
        something. The service was good but the bathrooms were disgusting. We
        told a person on the floor who acted like they were going to do
        something about it. My pregnant girlfriend waited about 20 minutes
        before trying the rest room again and it was the same. Team leader
        rambled his way through his justification. We will stick with pan Asia
        in Escondido!

        Great fresh sushi selection! heavy on the seafood, and had great hot
        soups. As far as buffets go this one is definitely one of the better
        ones in the area for cleanliness and actual hot food. Lunch price on a
        weekday was $17.99/person and considering the sushi alone was well worth
        it. We will be back!
