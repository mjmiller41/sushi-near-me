        While en route to Fisherman's Wharf, our cable car happened to pass by
        this ramen shop. Uncertain of what to anticipate, we were pleasantly
        surprised to discover that it was the finest ramen establishment we had
        the pleasure of visiting in San Francisco. The service was prompt, the
        ambiance cozy, and the cuisine delectable, evoking memories of Japan.

        The BEST ramen weâve had!! Broth was perfectly seasoned and all
        Ingredients tasted fresh. Salad and appetizers were also very delicious.
        Waiter was friendly and attentive. Lunch special was a great deal.

        My new favorite ramen ð in SF! I appreciate that the Niwa is vegan as
        is and doesn't need any additions (but I still asked for extra tofu for
        the protein ðª). Delicious broth and the noodles are perfect. My only
        complaint would be that the bok choy was a little hard to eat, but
        that's so minor because otherwise it's amazing. Order a young coconut ð¥¥
        and it comes with both a compostable straw (no plastic here!) plus a
        spoon to scoop the meat. Polite service and very relaxed atmosphere with
        cute decorations. I will absolutely be back and recommend this to
        others.

        Very calm and relaxing atmosphere for your ramen and Curry crave. Only
        one waiter so patients is of the essence, not very big party friendly
        but luckily ours was able to find a table.

        We found rural ramen bar because we wanted something warm on a rainy day
        and we were not disappointed! The spicy miso was super spicy without
        being salty and the tori paitan was sooo creamy. They were perfect to
        order together! The ramen portions are huge and the pork and chicken
        chashu in the ramen was giant too. I've never seen chashu that big
        before lol The poke salad was fresh and the chicken katsu curry was
        juicy and crispy too. My partner thought the curry was a little sweet
        but I thought it was just right and helped calm the spiciness from the
        spicy ramen lol The staff was very friendly and the food came out
        quickly. The perfect ramen spot!
