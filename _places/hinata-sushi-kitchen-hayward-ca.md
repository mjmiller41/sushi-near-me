        Hinata Sushi in Hayward offers a dining experience rooted in quality and
        simplicity. The salmon sushi was fresh and well-prepared, a reminder
        that great ingredients need little embellishment. The Omakase box
        provided a well-curated selection, each piece speaking for itself. The
        beef skewers were flavorful and satisfying, and even the fries—an
        unexpected addition—were crisp and enjoyable, enhanced by a variety of
        well-balanced sauces. The atmosphere was relaxed, and sharing the meal
        with a best friend made it all the more worthwhile. Good food, good
        company—nothing more is needed.

        Really amazing quality for AYCE! In particular the Tuna quality was
        really high, and they had some kind of chu-toro or otoro in their
        sashimi omakase box?! Anyways, amazing AYCE sushi for $42 and the sides
        were also very yummy!

        First time at all you can eat sushi spot. Everything was fine. Sushi was
        fresh. Only thing was I'm not a all you can eat person. Take my wife
        there to try it. Service was great as well. Wish there was a door at the
        entrance. The day my wife and I went is was hot and the place was kind
        of warm at the area where we sat.

        Legit sushi buffet! Sashimi quality is above average but not the
        best....but cmon now, it all you can eat! Been here 3 times and never
        been disappointed, the omakase is a nice touch but you can also order
        the sashimi if you want more. The beef n pork skewers were also good, i
        ordered mine without the teriyaki sauce which can be too sweet
        sometimes. Overall, great place to go if you're craving sushi! Great
        staff, nice menu offering, and good atmosphere.

        Recently moved to Hayward from Fremont, and was asked to give this
        recommendation a try. I was really impressed with the quality of their
        seafood and the speed of service. The staff were all very nice and
        welcoming, which is major in the food industry.


        Started off with the Omakase box, pork belly skewers, miso soup, gyudon,
        potstickers, and chicken karaage. Everything was a hit! My favorite had
        to be the pork belly. I'm not sure what the sauce was, but it's was
        sticky, sweet, and delicious.


        I ended my order with a few other rolls that were extremely satisfying.
        Everything ordered was shared family style, and we were beyond stuffed.
        $200+ for a group of 4, with all the food we ordered, is a steal
        compared to full menu restaurants.
