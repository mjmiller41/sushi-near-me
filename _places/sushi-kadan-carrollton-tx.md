        Food was yummy, tried eel for the first time in my sushi roll and it was
        pretty good. I also tried the fried rice! It was good just through me
        off that it had edamame in it but still yummy!

        This was my second visit to Sushi Kadan, and it reaffirmed my mixed
        feelings about the place.


        To start with the positives, the restaurant is undeniably beautiful. The
        cherry blossom decor is stunning and makes for great photos. The
        atmosphere is complemented by multiple TVs playing games, which adds a
        casual and lively vibe. Service is also a standout—attentive and
        accommodating.


        However, when it comes to the food, it falls short of expectations. My
        wife and I chose Sushi Kadan because we’re on a keto diet - monetarily -
        and were looking for rice-less rolls and sashimi. Unfortunately, the
        portions were problematic. The pieces were excessively large, making
        them difficult to enjoy. I’d prefer the same amount of food served in
        smaller, more manageable pieces.


        For instance, despite requesting thinner slices of sashimi—a request the
        restaurant assured would be no problem—the sashimi arrived overly thick
        and somewhat chewy. The rice-less rolls were similarly oversized and
        lacked sufficient fish, which was disappointing.


        I understand why Sushi Kadan has its fans—the ambiance and service are
        great—but for me, the food doesn’t stand out compared to the many other
        sushi options in the DFW area.

        Sat there for 10 minutes looking at the food because they didn’t bring
        any utensils 😂 How weird @@ This place used to be my top place, always
        stop by for important occasions because of their services and their
        food, but today was completely different. Nobody stopped by our table to
        take care of anything (that was why they didn’t realize the utensils
        missing and we couldn’t ask for help either). The food was taking not
        too long but everything was COLD. We got the lobster roll and it smelled
        very fishy (not fresh).

        This is a lot of things, but it's not Sushi. It's a lot of mayonnaise, a
        lot of mis-proportioned rolls that don't understand balance or flavor, a
        lot stuff.


        This is the American-Indian owned weird hamburger shack of Sushi. It's
        crude, it's totally disconnected from Japan or Japanese food and it's
        got a ton of fat and bad names for nonsense items. Look, you may love
        it, and if so good for you.


        If you like this place you don't like Japanese food, and you

        ABSOLUTELY don't like sushi. You like to TALK about sushi. But you don't
        know what it is or what "good" is. This place offers none of the above.
        For me, a horrific miss. I would rate it as "below grocery store". I've
        been a fanatic for 40 years with many trips over to Japan and across the
        US - and this is one of the worst. Sorry, but facts. I reiterate, I've
        had better at market street and whole foods that was closer to Japan
        than this nonsense.


        Please clean your cold case, it was disgusting and I knew things were
        off-track as soon as I saw the edges of it. Also please clean your bar
        and re-caulk it. Horrific.


        I threw away half of a $100 order because it was literally inedible.
        They made it "right" it was just inedible slop. From salmon that was
        tainted with off-flavors to california that was just a blob of fat,
        tekamaki made incorrectly, rice that was old, hard, and incorrectly
        vinegared, it's the kind of stuff that is obvious if you care.


        The staff were nice. They gave me a water while I had to wait. Otherwise
        horrific experience, worst sushi I've possibly ever had.

        Gave it a try...won't try again. I ordered gyoza which were soggy on the
        inside and over fried on the outside. Definitely not made fresh. Also,
        ordered a Philly roll. It was  different, just okay. Service was so-so.
        I wasn't asked about a refill and had to ask myself, my cup was empty.
        Lots of decor inside, maybe several fake cherry blossom trees and stuff
        on the ceiling. Decor was a bit much, made it seem small inside.
