        and the veggie gyoza.  Everything was delicious. The portion sizes were
        good as well. Was almost  3 meals for me.

        My cousin treated me to dinner last night, and everything about this
        place is outstanding. It has a warm feeling, amazing customer service,
        and delicious eats! The calamari was so on point! I will certainly be
        back!

        LOVE Xengo! 😋 Not crowded, friendly server!!! 😁


        I always order the exact same role, the shrimp tempura roll with
        cucumber and avocado. Order it - trust me it is the best!!! 🍣😍❤️🙌🏻


        Didn’t like any other rolls, but that one. 🍤 It’s very filling and $10.
        My mom loves this place too!!! 👍🏻

        After eating here a few weeks after they opened and not finding it very
        good, I decided to give them another chance on April 5, 2022. Being by
        myself I asked for a quiet corner. After seated I wasn't waited on.
        After returning to the front desk the server appeared, apologized and I
        ordered. Thought maybe I was seated in a section with no servers (very
        few people were here at the time...and it was a Tuesday.)


        The ginger salad was fine...a little watery. Made ahead and unwrapped?
        Maybe.

        Spring roll appetizers were good.

        Had the Lo Mein noodle with tofu. Noodles and few veggies that came with
        were nice, somewhat flavorful, tofu not so much.


        The plate with the spring rolls filled me up. Sever was attentive and
        pleasant. As a single, the food came out fast. Table was sticky, though.
        Saw a lot of take out happening. Some families strolling in.


        Not a bad experience, but not a memorable one. 3 stars seems right. Try
        it, you might like it. Probably be some time before I come in again.

        I have been going to XenGo quite regularly for 8+ years with my family.
        And we always were satisfied with service and food, except maybe when I
        tried Pho which was blunt. This is not my favorite sushi place, but I
        order sushi from time to time.

        So the reason for posting this review is that today I ordered Chirashi
        don for 35$ and it was a total rip-off - huge bowl with sushi rice at
        the bottom and 12 paper thin slices of fish + 2 small shrimps and one
        crab stick. I bet there were 2 oz of fish in total with total cost of
        5$.


        Please be aware when ordering sushi as you don't really know what you
        are getting when you order.


        The other non-sushi dishes my family had were fine and big portions. So
        it doesn't look like an owner is cutting portion sizes while increasing
        prices across the board. It might be sushi chef initiative if he is on
        separate PnL.
