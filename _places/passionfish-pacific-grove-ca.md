        Food is OK:

        Spicy fish stew - a bit too spicy for my taste, fish is tender

        Beets salad - Good and fresh

        Sea scallops - scallops are good, but the rice custard was very bland
        and dense, not much flavor

        Duck Confit - OK, meat was tender and can easily come off the bone

        Chocolate torte - Good, dense with intense chocolate flavor


        Wait time between soup and the salad was almost an hour, again wait time
        between salad and main course was at least half an hour. It took us 3
        hours to finish the dinner.


        Had no reservation, walk-in on a Saturday night, waited for 30 mins.


        Overall, it's ok.

        Food is OK:

        Spicy fish stew - a bit too spicy for my taste, fish is tender

        Beets salad - Good and fresh

        Sea scallops - scallops are good, but the rice custard was very bland
        and dense, not much flavor

        Duck Confit - OK, meat was tender and can easily come off the bone

        Chocolate torte - Good, dense with intense chocolate flavor


        Wait time between soup and the salad was almost an hour, again wait time
        between salad and main course was at least half an hour. It took us 3
        hours to finish the dinner.


        Had no reservation, walk-in on a Saturday night, waited for 30 mins.


        Overall, it's ok.

        All their food was delicious. My family escpecially loved the fried
        squid. At most restaurants, the squid is served in a pile, but at
        Passionfish, the squid is beautifully placed around a pile of cilantro.
        My kids loved the buttermilk biscuit. I personally didn't eat it, but
        they said it was really good. The outer shell looked crispy, and they
        told me the inner part was very soft. For the entrees, I ordered a
        Rainbow Trout. The fish itself was really good. The fish had only salt
        and lemon on top of it. I really liked that they put the sauce on the
        side because I am the type of person that doesn't like a  lot of sauce.
        Dessert I got the chocolate sorbet. The sorbet was made without milk, so
        the texture was very creamy. It was made with dark chocolate. Our server
        was welcoming and sincere. He earned five stars for service. The whole
        restaurant dominated a very calm atmosphere, with quiet murmurs. I will
        definitely come back here to eat if I can.🥰🥰

        This restaurant was better than a seafood Michelin star restaurant that
        I went to in San Francisco for half the price. The scallops, sauces, and
        accompaniments were amazing. The service was also top notch and the
        restaurant atmosphere was also nice. I would highly recommend coming
        here for a memorable evening. I didn't get a the bread pudding dessert
        because I was too full but I'd recommend it based on other reviews.

        One of my favorite go-to places. You can count on great food & service.
        The owners are wonderful & truly care about their guests. Also, as a
        southerner,  must say, the biscuits are fabulous.

        What a special place. I've been coming to the area for travel and for
        the love of food. This is the best restaurant I've been to in the area.
        Here's why:


        The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. Clean, cozy,  decorated so well.


        The staff is incredible. They make you feel welcome and do not miss a
        beat on the service. Everyone is working together. Although it got busy,
        everyone had a wonderful attitude. The manager even came by and talked
        to us for a bit. Very personal.


        The food is incredible. Each dish tells a story. The flavors are
        incredible, as well as the texture. We had scallops and they were cooked
        to perfection.


        Awesome experience.
