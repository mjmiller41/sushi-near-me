        The sushi here was… okay. It wasn’t terrible, but it didn’t blow me away
        either. The fish seemed fresh enough, but the flavors were a bit bland,
        and the rice was slightly overcooked. I tried a few rolls, and while
        they were decent they lacked creativity or anything to set them apart.


        The atmosphere was fine. Nothing special but clean and comfortable.
        Service was polite.


        Overall, it’s not a bad spot if you’re craving sushi and don’t have high
        expectations but it’s definitely not somewhere I’d go out of my way for.

        The price is unbelievable as someone who came from LA to SLO especially
        for what I got. The food was amazing and like I already knew that the
        service would be a little slow if I came midday so I was prepared to
        wait a little for the food (it is just because there aren't many people
        midday so there are not that many staff which makes perfect sense). Also
        the plating was beautiful (I was so excited for this though I forgot to
        take a picture ahhh) which was a plus. Everyone working the day I went
        was so nice too (I think it was last Monday 2/2/25). Anyways, will be
        coming here again next time I am in town!

        Wanted to do the all you can eat sushi, we were told it was a 40 minute
        wait and had us put our names down on a handmade list. 35 minutes pass
        and we go back just to be told we can not be served due to a private
        party coming in. They are unorganized and unprepared for any sort of big
        rush on the most basic of levels. Their host was flustered and their
        lead unprofessional

        My husband and I were disappointed with our experience at this sushi
        restaurant. When we were seated, the floor under our table was dirty,
        which left a bad first impression. We ordered the all-you-can-eat
        option, but no one ever came back to take a second order from us. We had
        to ask for basic items like wasabi and ginger after our sushi finally
        arrived.


        To make matters worse, several people who arrived after us were served
        their food much quicker, making us feel ignored. The staff seemed to
        cater more to younger customers, leaving us feeling overlooked.


        As for the food, it was just okay—nothing special. We ended up not
        eating much due to the poor service and overall experience.
        Unfortunately, I can’t recommend this place based on our visit.
