        Last night was my first time at Honda and it was a wonderful culinary
        experience! We sat at the bar and really enjoyed interacting with the
        chefs, they all had big personalities and excellent knife skills! I
        ordered Omakase, chefs choice, sashimi and sushi and was not
        disappointed, everything that I was served was beautifully prepared, 
        presented and delicious.  We also enjoyed a nice bottle of sake with our
        meal.  My only complaint was the time it took to get my sushi.  I
        understand that sitting at the bar and ordering omakase is an experience
        but my wife was finished with her meal before I was halfway through my
        dinner.  The food was tasty, the staff were great but the meal could
        have been timed a bit better.  I will return to Restaurant Honda again!

        I had the Pork Katsu which was cooked perfectly and very tender with
        plenty of flavor and came with Miso Soup and a bowl of White Rice. The
        Teriyaki Beef Combo that also came with Tempura and Shrimp was cooked
        perfectly and the Teriyaki Sauce was on point. Salmon Skin Sushi was
        amazing. This place has a great menu. Lots of great Japanese food with
        real attentive servers. Give this place a try.

        This place is well hidden, not noticable from the road, but if you take
        your time to venture behind the Big Tire, you will find Honda!

        Deliciously prepared sushi with so-cal twist. It is fresh, it is tasty,
        it is amazing!

        3 rolls, 25+ mins. Came in 1 hour 10 mins before posted closing time. 25
        mins later, a server tells us "the kitchen closes in 10 mins, do you
        have any final orders?" we didnt even get our original order.


        No ginger, no wasabi, no sauce plate provided.


        Sloppy pepper tuna and whatever the hell was served to us as a spicy
        yellowtail roll is the picture provided. Take a good look at that piece
        in the bottom right corner. Literally just seaweed and rice. Really not
        sure who thought that was acceptable to serve.


        Taste wise, just average. Painfully slow service. Bar had a few patrons
        but there were no other tables when we left.


        Not sure what we did but it definitely wasnt worth $60.
