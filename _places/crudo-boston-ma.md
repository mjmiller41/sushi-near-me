        Mediocre and overpriced sushi spot in North End.


        A sushi restaurant under Greek ownership  in North End initially seemed
        a bit out of place. Its jarring divergence from the localeâs culinary
        identity was interesting, but at the same time, I was a bit skeptical of
        the quality of sushi they serve. With typical bar decors and thumping
        bit remix tunes, it had similar vibe as other small bars in North End,
        but unfortunately, it failed to deliver.


        For the appetizers, I had the pop rock shrimp and the shrimp tacos which
        seemed to be one of the most popular choices. The shrimp, however, was
        heavily salted. Thankfully, the salmon tacos were well-balanced. It felt
        like a mix of poke and Mexican bowls, but even this dish felt overpriced
        given its portion and composition.


        The Geisha Girl and Cru-Oh! Lasagna sushi rolls both sounded promising
        but delivered a disappointing palate experience. They felt uninspired,
        especially when stacked against other sushi places I've frequented in
        Boston. Small portions and scarce toppings coupled with the fact that
        the sushi rice tasted like it was cooked some time ago made them one of
        the worst rolls Iâve had in the city.


        Now, I understand why even the locals shy away from this place.
        Overpriced and mediocre sushi spots just feels like a waste of space in
        North End. If youâre craving for sushi, Iâd recommend going elsewhere.

        I stumbled upon this restaurant hungry and hot. It was happy hour so I
        decided to give it a try. I'll give Crudo five stars for sure, excellent
        presentation on all the dishes, excellent sushi, excellent selection and
        the brunch special also known as happy hour was a pretty good deal. Our
        server was excellent he was very cool and attentive.

        Tried out Crudo after a festive day trip to Salem in October with
        friends. We got the sushi boat and split some sake - which I'd
        definitely recommend for groups. I've had better sushi elsewhere, but
        there were tons of options and the quality was good. We had a fun time.

        Upon walking in, we were greeted by the lovely host. She, the food
        runner and our server all made sure we were well taken care of. The
        prices are reasonable for the good quality of food that youâre getting.
        However, one major downside of our dinning experience was the fact that
        our food took a long time to come out. But, I will chalk this up to
        being super hungry and it being a Friday night. I would still definitely
        recommend!
