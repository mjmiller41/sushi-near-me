        I cannot say enough good things about this place. We ordered 6 different
        sushi rolls and they were all delicious. Best sushi I’ve had in Ohio,
        maybe best I’ve had anywhere. The cocktails were great as well and the
        crab cake appetizer was amazing. The service was spectacular, our
        waitress was extremely nice and helpful. My husband took me here for my
        birthday and when the waitress heard we were there celebrating, she gave
        us a dessert on the house. That being said, the creme brûlée was the
        best I’ve ever had, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it since.
        We will definitely be returning and recommending this place to everyone
        we know!

        sushi rolls and they were all delicious. Best sushi I’ve had in Ohio,
        maybe best I’ve had anywhere. The cocktails were great as well and the
        crab cake appetizer was amazing. The service was spectacular, our
        waitress was extremely nice and helpful. My husband took me here for my
        birthday and when the waitress heard we were there celebrating, she gave
        us a dessert on the house. That being said, the creme brûlée was the
        best I’ve ever had, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it since.
        We will definitely be returning and recommending this place to everyone
        we know!

        Nice place for a celebratory occasion. The atmosphere is great and
        everyone is very friendly. It’s well lit, not too hot or too cold, but
        after about an hour the chairs (we had a 4 top and not a booth, which is
        fine) are not very comfy. I had the chicken which was good, not
        outstanding but good. The three red meat eaters all had steak. I was
        told the filet was a bit dry and the ribeye didn’t have a lot of flavor
        (he said it could have used some butter in the sear). We also started
        with sushi which was good but could have been rolled better, it
        basically fell apart when we picked it up. I was also told the duck fat
        fries were really good. I doubt we’d frequent again, it was pricey and
        there are better cuts of meat elsewhere.

        The restaurant is very beautiful and beautifully decorated. My date was
        super excited because she had never been to this restaurant before. The
        first waiter I had was wonderful but apparently I arrived right when his
        shift was over so I ended up getting a different waiter. Sadly he was a
        bit slow, maybe a little bit nervous. My date steak was overly cooked,
        the waiter was kind enough to bring it to the restaurant manager and
        they were kind enough to remove it from the bill. My ribs were a bit dry
        but everything else was absolutely delicious. Our salad, the mac and
        cheese, and my creamed spinach was really good. We were kind of offended
        a bit by the waiter acting like we weren't familiar nor could possibly
        afford certain dishes. I actually had to confront him a bit and state
        "well why we would be here"? "We attend fine restaurants all the time."
        So we found that slightly offensive but otherwise it was a nice night.

        Our waiter was Rob, and he was amazing.  All of his suggestions were on
        point. We went there for our anniversary and it was a perfect dinner. My
        wife and I will for sure be visiting again for sure. Highly recommend
        this restaurant!!!


        My wife said the Mac and cheese was the best she ever had just saying.
