        The staff is very kind. We ordered bento. Beef ribs and spicy pork. We
        also had a bulgogi meal. The bulgogi and spicy pork had an authentic
        Korean taste. The beef ribs were very tender and had an also great
        taste. The sushi called Scallop Volcano was also very good. we couldn't
        dine in because we had a dog with us, but the food was very delicious.
        We stopped by on the way back from Portland before heading to
        Washington. We will definitely be back. I'd love to this restaurant open
        in Washington too!!

        This place has some of the best Japanese food I've had outside Japan.
        Everything was fresh and tasty. Prices are great for the quality. Staff
        was welcoming, friendly, and helpful. Restaurant is clean, and the
        atmosphere is relaxing. It wasn't quiet, but it wasn't so loud that we
        couldn't use normal conversation volume to talk. My only problem was
        trying to decide what of my many options to get. Even my 6 year old had
        plenty of things off the kids menu and appetizer menu she wanted to try.
        Will definitely be returning to try more of the menu.

        Very comfortable little sushi place. 🍣 my friend and I enjoyed our food
        very much. The monkey balls were my favorite 😍😋 the sushi portions are
        huge which makes it awkward to eat but nice and filling. The service was
        great. Out server checked on us frequently.

        When you sign up, they offer a complimentary item on Saturdays, and
        today's complimentary item was salmon collar. I love their salmon and
        ikura (salmon roe) bowl and used to order it for takeout often during
        the COVID pandemic. This time, we got two dinner bento boxes. The bento
        lets you choose two items, so my husband chose bulgogi and mixed
        tempura, while I went with salmon teriyaki and sashimi. Japanese food is
        often pricey with small portions, but here, the prices are reasonable,
        the portions are generous, and the taste is authentically Japanese.
        We'll definitely be coming back to try more!🤤
