        In town and wanted to fulfill my sudden crave for sushi. Location has
        plenty of parking and service was spectacular. Received some
        complimentary items, and quite grateful! Ordered the tempura shrimp and
        spicy tuna roll. Shrimp excellent and tuna was delicious. Also have done
        carry out which was quick, accurate, and yummy. Glad there is a

        This is a gem.  Everything here was wonderful.  First off, it's
        wonderfully decorated, very fun and immaculately clean.  The food is
        delicious and it came out so quickly.  With my meal, I received three
        amuse bouches.  Edamame, a slightly sweet and savory cocktail room and a
        decadent chocolate cheesecake bite.  It was all so good.  The serving
        sizes were very good and the prices extremely reasonable.  Just a great
        place with great food, ambiance and value.

        We thoroughly enjoyed our meals here! The sushi was terrific and the
        presentation and service were top notch. I had the Yama roll that has
        real crab meat and it was delicious. We tried several different
        specialty rolls and they were all fabulous. The decor is nicely done and
        clean. Our waitress brought us a slice of cheesecake on the house after
        our meal. It was my daughter’s birthday, but we hadn’t said anything,
        and she loved the extra treat! I would love to come back for more!

        I joined a coworker at YamaChen's for a lunch meal and was quite pleased
        with the outcome. We found the location to be uniquely decorated with a
        cozy and upbeat vibe. The menu had ample choices and we finally settled
        on a sushi boat, a specialty roll, some miso, and sampled other items.
        Everything was fresh and quite delicious. I was impressed with the
        quantity and the presentation of the dishes. I also must applaud the
        staff on the super friendly and prompt service. It made me feel so
        warmly welcomed, which is rare and appreciated. I would recommend this
        location to anyone looking for good value, great service, and yummy
        eats. I will certainly return to explore more on their menu.
