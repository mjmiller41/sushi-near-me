        This was my first time at this location. When i eat Thai food, i usually
        try their sweet and sour soup. The flavor their soup provided was second
        to none 5 STAR.  It was so flavorful and came with plenty of veggies.


        The sushi roll was just OK. It just had too much rice for my taste 3
        STAR.


        I also tried the garlic chicken. I was slightly disappointed due to the
        mild flavors 3 STAR.


        The restaurant is a little dark, but the service was spot on. I would
        definitely try other dishes here.

        This place was OUTSTANDING! Their chicken satay and fresh rolls with
        shrimp were very tasty and the yellow curry with seafood was so
        delicious I felt like I could just drink the curry sauce in a cup. Not
        too spicy and just the right amount of sweetness from the coconut milk,
        lots of veggies and they didn’t skimp on the amount of seafood in the
        dish. The atmosphere was quaint and intimate, a great little restaurant
        for any lover of Thai food. That also had a robust sushi menu which I
        didn’t try this visit, but I look forward to eating here again.

        Started with a tofu miso soup, sesame chicken and General Tso’s chicken.
        Chicken was crispy with great flavor (3/5 hotness, but you can order as
        you like). Food came out quick and was freshly made.


        The server was attentive, but a little TOO attentive. It almost felt as
        if our stay was unwelcome. Other than that, everything was great!

        I love sushi, I love thai food, being able to get both in one spot is
        great. Sushi quality was good, the main dishes were equal to our local
        joint which is also great. Prices were fair, location very convenient.

        Take out is a miss. Every time I have ordered from them, my take out
        order comes as a container of rice or noodles, accompanied with a
        container of the protein and vegetables swimming in liquid, served up
        basically as a soup which you need to figure out what to do with, let
        alone hope it survives the journey home, not to mention it’ll be in a
        cardboard container like mine.. sporting the “pure leaf” logo, as if
        they got it from the gas station across the street.

        For the price, this isn’t a good value. I’m sure sit down service and
        preparation is excellent, but I’m sorry to say that take out is a joke.
