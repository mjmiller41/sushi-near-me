        I had an outstanding experience at Totoyama Sushi & Ramen in Hollywood —
        hands down, some of the best sushi I’ve ever had!


        The quality and freshness of the rolls were simply incredible. Every
        bite was packed with flavor, and you could really taste how fresh the
        seafood was. We ordered a roll with eel, and to my surprise, the eel
        portion was three times larger than the rice — something you rarely see,
        especially in the U.S. The portions overall were huge — definitely
        generous enough to satisfy any sushi lover.


        The presentation was also impressive, with a diverse and creative
        arrangement that made the dishes look just as good as they tasted.


        Now, let’s talk about the prices — they were shockingly low! I honestly
        didn’t expect to find such high-quality seafood at such affordable
        prices in America. It felt like an absolute steal for the kind of meal
        we had.


        A special mention goes to the chef, who not only prepared everything
        super quickly but also took the time to guide us through the menu. He
        was incredibly helpful, pointing out which rolls were made exclusively
        with seafood and which ones might be prepared alongside non-halal
        ingredients — something I really appreciated.

        I must stop if you’re in the area, a nice hidden gem tucked away in the
        city! The service was amazing and they definitely made me feel at home
        for the 30 minutes. I was there.

        My friend and I enjoyed these delicious sake martinis! Which I never
        knew were a thing? And they were so delicious! Decided to grab a little
        sushi appetizer ( the spider roll) WOW ! I definitely will be coming
        back here with my girlfriends!

        As Aussies travelling in America, sometimes you just need a quiet
        evening without having to reciprocate high energy service. This was the
        comforting meal with polite service we needed. The food felt healthy and
        the service allowed us to feel comfortable in our own space.

        A Hidden Gem on Hollywood Boulevard – Fresh Food and Exceptional
        Service!


        I had the pleasure of dining at Totoyama Sushi and Ramen on Hollywood
        Boulevard, and it was a great experience! From the moment I walked in, I
        was greeted with warm smiles and attentive service. The staff was
        friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and made excellent
        recommendations.


        The food was absolutely top-notch. The sushi was incredibly fresh, with
        each piece crafted to perfection. The sashimi practically melted in my
        mouth, and the rolls were flavorful and beautifully presented. I also
        tried their ramen, and it was rich, savory, and perfectly
        balanced—comfort food at its finest.


        What stood out most was the attention to detail. From the quality of the
        ingredients to the presentation, it’s clear Totoyama takes pride in
        every dish they serve. The atmosphere was cozy yet modern, making it a
        great spot for both casual meals and special occasions.


        If you’re in Hollywood and craving fresh sushi or hearty ramen, I highly
        recommend stopping by Totoyama. You won’t be disappointed!

        Great place for a meal before a show at the Pantages,but give yourself
        time since it tends to be packed in the 2 hours before shows. They're
        great about being fast. Also fabulous with food allergies!
