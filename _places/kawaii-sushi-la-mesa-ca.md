        We work down the street at Bob Stall and we have been waiting for this
        restaurant to open for weeks. I have had the lunch special twice
        already, and it's amazing. The service is wonderful, everyone is so
        kind. I have had the honeydew and kiwi smoothie and both were great.
        10/10, highly recommended!

        The sushi was good. The Thai tea was really good but pricey, it was
        $6.50. Be aware that there are different prices for dine in and take
        out. We first sat down and decided to get it to go and we were charged
        the dine in price. Even though we took it home to eat.

        Kawaii is an outstanding sushi restaurant with a clean, welcoming
        atmosphere and top-notch service. The prices are affordable, making it a
        great spot for quality sushi without overspending. The food is fresh and
        delicious—my favorites are the Crunchy Roll and Triple Fish Roll, both
        packed with flavor and beautifully prepared. The miso soup is also a
        must-try, warm and comforting with just the right balance of flavors.


        One of the highlights of my visit was the excellent service from
        Jasmine. She was incredibly friendly, professional, and attentive,
        making sure everything was perfect throughout the meal. Her warm
        attitude and knowledge of the menu made the experience even better. If
        you’re looking for a great sushi spot with delicious food and
        exceptional service, Kawaii is the place to go!
