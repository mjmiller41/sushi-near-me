        We really enjoyed coming here. The sushi was very good! We came with our
        two school aged children. The children’s menu was very satisfactory. Our
        child who likes sushi was able to get the California roll and our other
        child who is unsure of sushi got mini corndogs with fries. We got the
        edimame for appetizer, which was a crowd favorite and our meals all came
        with miso soup and a picked salad. We were already getting full before
        the main came. My husband and I shared the Sushi boat. It was very good
        and plenty for the two of us to share and for the kids to have little
        tastes as well. The kids meals finished off with ice cream. Amazing! The
        waitress was very kind and helpful. We liked the atmosphere to where if
        you want to go on a nice date you can, however if you come with kids you
        don’t feel like outcasts. The kids are cared for. Finally, they have
        “fun chops” for the kids to put on their chopsticks so they can have
        assistance but still be encouraged to use them. What a wonderful
        evening!

        This place is absolutely handsome down the sushi spot on the foot hills.
        Mike, Tray, Kate and the rest of the staff are an absolute delight. The
        fish is as fresh as you can get it in the mountains, the drinks are
        cold, refreshing and interesting. Reminds me of Suisan from Hawaii. They
        got over 30 years in the business and you can taste it.

        Overall pleasant experience. Food was decent if pedestrian. Portions of
        lunch specials were generous. Udon was nicely cooked, with a nice chew.
        Sushi rolls were more pedestrian. Spider roll didn’t have much soft
        shell crab in it.

        This place has really fallen off. Sushi was sub par, the bartender at
        the sushi bar never asked if we wanted another drink, she forgot about
        virtually everything and we had to remind her multiple times. The
        bartender/server forgot to put in my wife’s order and then after all
        that charges us for everything without even acknowledging any of her
        mistakes. She acted like she was high or something. Completely clueless
        and air headed. Our bill was $129 for two people this place isn’t worth
        that at all. Go somewhere else.

        Food is always great. Service is almost always good, but our server
        tonight didn't put our order in for 45 min. Then forgot it and had to
        take it again, then we asked for to go boxes because we were there for
        an hour and half already and he got an attitude, saying some real bratty
        things to my Mom. That was her birthday dinner too. Always 10/10 but
        tonight I wouldn't reccomend that to anyone. Just go on the off hours
        when they're not busy.
