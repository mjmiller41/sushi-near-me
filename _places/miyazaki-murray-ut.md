        Tried the unagi bowl. I loved all the flavors and the veggies it came
        with. It did have too much eel sauce on it. So it made it pretty salty.
        My server brought me a spicy house made sauce that was delicious. I also
        tried a fukomaki tempura shrimp roll. Simple roll. It was great. I tried
        a Yuma soda which is a grapefruit soda with strawberry flavors. I wish
        it was more sweet and could taste the strawberry. The water was cool and
        no ice which I enjoyed. The place is clean and beautiful. It wasn't too
        busy Sunday evening. Customer service is great. I want to go back and
        try other dishes. But It is a bit pricey for a sushi roll.

        All was fine and good except for the one food item.


        I ordered a roll that I took special attention to ensure it didn't
        contain and contain an ingredient that I don't like. The first piece I
        ate tasted like it was present. I looked in the next piece, it wasn't
        readily identifiable. I thought the combination of other ingredients
        happen to form an mistaken, false association. I continued eating. Each
        subsequent piece was more strongly accentuated. I picked the fourth
        piece apart, confirming my suspicion. I picked out what I could find,
        and optimistically continued. The effort failed to mute. When the server
        checked in, I asked to confirm that I didn't make a mistake of what I
        ordered. It was not a mistake. It was not listed in the menu. The server
        went and asked the chef. I heard an exchange that consisted loosely of;
        Server: "Was that roll made with [ingredient]?", Chef: "Yeah.", Server:
        "It's not supposed to be made with that.", Chef: "Yeah, I thought he
        would like it." The server offered to have it be remade without it, but
        at the point I already lost my appetite, my pallet was ruined and my
        trust a little damaged.


        The other items and drinks were really good. Calamari was perfect. Miso
        was great. Salad was fresh, dressing was well balanced. My dining
        partners were satisfied with their meals. The staff was really nice and
        attentive.


        My recommendation of their sushi will have to wait until a next visit. I
        can't commit to having tried their sushi as intended. If I were to
        separate the components and judge individually; tuna was fresh and
        excellent, rice was well cooked, vegetables were fresh and good (save
        for my opinion of the one I personally don't like that is bias.) The
        accompanied sauce was too drastically altered by the (personally)
        offensive vegetable for me to make a fair assessment of the taste.
        Visually, it looked great.

        the Wagyu Curry Don was amaaaazing!! very soft and tender and juicy
        beef, and curry flavor was also perfect- definitely recommend! the rolls
        were very good and made fresh too. Miyazaki is on the slightly pricey
        side for sure, but i do think it's high quality and service

        Food was delicious.   Plus super fast.


        Ambience and customer service were excellent.


        The serving sizes were more than decent; Katsu curry chicken was huge
        (and delicious)!


        Highly recommend the Katsu Curry Chicken, Ramen and the Wagu hamburger.
