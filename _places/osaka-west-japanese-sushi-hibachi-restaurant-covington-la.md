        If it wasn’t for the awesome hibachi guy, we likely would have been
        completely disappointed. Food was cooked but Different things tasted
        like an old fish tank smells- miso soup, vegetables. Rice seemed old but
        flavorful and editable. Family said they got some that was crunchy.
        Timing was good Thursday night 5pm only one chef but no customers,
        hibachi tables all open so got service relatively quickly. Staff very
        friendly. Overall, food not worth the price point. Sushi was different
        than normal, not bad just not the same as we typically get, seemed
        skimpy. It was very cold in there given it was freezing outside,
        certainly was uncomfortable inside. Dark in room but pulled up blinds
        and was blinded by sun for dinner. Needs some new lighting so chefs can
        see.

        Really pleased. Flavor of the food was quite tasty. They use a powder
        mix that seems to heighten flavor. Chicken base garlic and onion. I
        loved the fresh crunch of the salad and zesty dressing. I had chicken
        terriaki which I recommend over plain chicken. Steak was tender and
        cooked to order. I will definitely return.

        They advertised that their all you can eat is now on Thursdays too. When
        I called to verify they confirmed that, Yes, today (Thursday) was indeed
        all you can eat. However, when we called again on our way to see if they
        were busy, not only did they change their story, but the owner laughed
        at us for even asking after he confirmed that it was indeed posted on
        their specials board in the restaurant. Changing your stores policy is
        one thing, but for the owners themselves to laugh at you for inquiring
        about the specials they themselves posted is beyond disrespectful and
        they will not be receiving any of my business ever again!

        In the mood for some sushi... we stopped in and ended up doing the
        hibachi with some side sushi rolls. The place was empty and we were a
        little concerned... but everything was fresh and high quality. Had the
        shrimp hibachi and a Miami roll. The salad was the best I have had
        anywhere!

        10/10 would highly recommend. From the moment we walked in, everyone was
        so friendly and attentive. Looks like my husband and I found our new go
        to sushi spot. Looking forward to coming back in the future.
