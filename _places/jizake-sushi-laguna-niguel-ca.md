        One of the best restaurants and the best sushi place in Laguna Niguel.
        The space is cozy and small; the service is fabulous with everyone being
        so nice, attentive and friendly. The sushi is fresh and authentic. They
        have a wide variety of appetizers that all are fresh and tasty (we LOVED
        their calamari and gyoza). All their roles were also delicious. Highly
        recommended place for locals

        We absolutely love this place!!  The atmosphere is so awesome and
        everyone seems to know everyone.   The sushi chefs are very funny and
        personable if you sit at the bar.   I highly recommend getting a
        reservation though because we didn't the first time we went there and we
        had to wait close to an hour.   It is very popular!!  The rolls were got
        were the moonlight roll (the one with asparagus) and the viva Mexico (
        lobster and cheese and fried).  Those are our two favorite specialty
        rolls!  So good!!!!

        My family and I usually love Jizake and have been to this place multiple
        times over the years. However after last nights dinner not sure if we
        will come back. The first issue is that the server forgot to bring us 3
        of our appetizers. I also noticed that my hot sake wasn't very hot and
        that they have trimmed down the size of their rolls.  During the meal it
        became obvious to all of us outside that they were using a wifi speaker
        and whoesever phone it was hooked up to must have been moving around
        since the music was going in and out. Lastly while asking for the check
        I instructed the server to take the appetizers off our bill since we
        didn't receive them. He said he would and when he came back I was given
        a hand written bill with the break down. To his credit those appetizers
        were shown but not charged. I totaled up each line item and everything
        seemed correct as the subtotal was $170 with tax total should have been
        $183.17. However after taking my credit card he came back saying they
        totaled our bill incorrectly and apologized. Our new printed bill after
        charging my credit card didn't show the pricing break down for all the
        items but it appears that they added back in the money for the
        appetizers as with tax it came to $196.11 plus tip. By this point we
        just wanted to leave. After getting home we started not feeling so well.
        We don't usually have any bad reactions to sushi so maybe it was some
        sort of cross contamination issue. Either way I would caution everyone
        while eating at this establishment.
