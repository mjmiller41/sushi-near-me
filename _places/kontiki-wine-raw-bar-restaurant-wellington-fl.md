        I’ve been going to Kontiki for years now because the food is delicious,
        the vibes are fun, and the service is outstanding! Their best bar
        tender/server Tan is incredibly sweet, attentive and treats me like
        family! I highly recommend this place for a fun date night or good time
        celebrating with friends in Wellington!

        I started going back mainly because Than and Poppy are such warm and
        friendly bartenders. It doesn't hurt that they're easy on the eyes. The
        friendly Thai staff is so nice and welcoming, it's such an authentic
        feel. I go for that more than the food which is also good but the
        bartenders are what really keeps me coming back. Once you get to know
        them, they are so nice and look after you.

        Everything about this place is AMAZING.  My 1st time was November 4th of
        this year, and it  became my new favorite spot. I've been back twice,
        since my Birthday, all in the same month. Every time was a great
        experience.  I have never had such great quality Sushi and sashimi,
        along with other food items (huge selection). All fresh ingredients.
        Beautiful and creative dishes. I am a big food critic. They get a 10/10.

        The atmosphere is magnificent.  It's definitely a hidden gem! You
        wouldn't be disappointed.

        Let's not forget how welcoming and friendly the staff at Kontiki in
        Wellington FL are wonderful.

        The Homemade Thai tea is out of this world, nothing compares to it!

        Came here on my birthday while on vacation. I haven’t had such amazing
        sushi in over three years where I live. I was in heaven. The food and
        atmosphere was great. Our waitress Morning was adorable and on top of
        her game. My husband got the  Osso Bucco it was so tender and he was
        very happy with his meal. We got the pad Thai and shrimp fried rice to
        share. My kids and I got the sushi and like I already said. It was
        absolutely amazing! I didn’t want it to end. The fish was fresh and
        buttery, the rolls weren’t shoved full of rice like many places. Superb!
        Thank you for making my birthday memorable.
