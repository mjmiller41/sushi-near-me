        A day to try out new restaurant and I chose this one today. The food was
        great, and the service was 100/10. He was friendly, helping us grill the
        meat and checking on us often. The portion of food is worth the price.
        It was my first time trying Jajangmyeon, and it tastes awesome. My
        fiance loves it a lot. I haven’t tried the sushi yet, but I will
        definitely come back next time for it.

        It was my first time trying Jajangmyeon, and it tastes awesome. My
        fiance loves it a lot. I haven’t tried the sushi yet, but I will
        definitely come back next time for it.

        Loved the food here! We ordered a wide variety for our group of four and
        we each had a leftover meal to take home. We ordered una-kyo roll which
        is eel and cucumber, this was my least favorite as the eel was too
        fishy, but we are in lansing so I get it. Everything else was delicious,
        tteokbaki which was spicy, delicious and soft rice cakes. The kimchijeon
        was huge and awesome as an appetizer. A very thick, crispy and flavorful
        pancake with a delicious dipping sauce. We also got the bulgogi beef
        soup which was one of my favorite dishes, it had warm japchae noodles
        and a very flavorful and comforting broth and plenty of veggies, the
        beef was tender and delicious. We also ordered a bibimbap dish which was
        awesome. And a chicken stir fry which was sweet but good and had some
        delicious dumplings! Next time I’m coming for their hot pot or Korean
        bbq which looks awesome!! Favorite restaurant in all of Lansing so far!

        Can't say they are the best Korean restaurant I've been to, but we went
        here two days in a row, so that's saying a lot. A solid 4 on taste.


        There was a Korean convention going on at the same time, so this place
        was popping out the seams at 8pm on a Saturday. There were only 2
        servers. So while service was slow and food came out slower, they did
        what they could and accommodated us very well. Our servers (we had one
        on Saturday and the other on Sunday) were both nice and quick. The
        Chinese lady was a little curt at first, but I could see she was just
        stressed from the unexpected rush of customers. After I thanked her for
        doing her best, she relaxed and gave me the most beautiful smile. She
        was very pleasant after that.


        Chadol-baki, Korean bbq, came precooked (you don't cook on the table) on
        a hot sizzling dish, pre-seasoned and tasting great. It doesn't come
        with all the normal Korean bbq fare (lettuce, perilla leaves, garlic,
        pepper, green onions), but with rice and ssamjang. While the meat was
        good, I really don't like eating just meat without the veggies, so this
        one was a disappointment.


        dolsot bibimbap

        friend said it was your average bibimbap. You really can't go very wrong
        with this dish.


        tangsuyuk

        They ran out of this dish on Saturday, but we were able to get it on
        Sunday. It was quite yummy. And even though I didn't ask for the sauce
        on the side like I usually do, it didn't really get soggy throughout the
        meal, and stayed good through the last bite.


        kanpung shrimp

        They ran out of kanpungki (chicken), so we got shrimp. I actually liked
        the shrimp better than the chicken.


        octopus bokkum

        (little octopus stir fried in hot sauce)

        This actually tasted quite authentic, despite being on the milder side
        of the heat spectrum.


        jjamppong-bap

        heard from some friends that the rice version is better than the noodle
        version, so we got the rice. But another friend later told us that the
        noodles were very good too. So I'm thinking that the noodles got
        overdone with an influx of customers on Friday, but the kitchen is
        normally better and fixed it the next day. Either way, the soup was
        quite good, and generous with ingredients and portion.


        The consensus is that the jaeyuk-bokkum (pork belly stir fry) is on the
        sweet side for our Korean tooth, but good for the more American friends.


        Oh, and the banchan... they were meager portions, especially compared to
        the generous main dish portions, and no one refilled them unless you
        asked, and of course, it was difficult to ask when they looked so busy.
        This is why so many restaurants in Korea make banchan self-service...


        Overall, a solid Korean restaurant, that won't disappoint.

        I have always liked Korea House's food, and always recommended the place
        to others. But today, I had a weirdly bad experience that I want to
        share. 5 of us went there around 2.30 pm for a late lunch. I knew that
        they're closed between 3-4 pm, so we asked first if they can serve. They
        said they could, but we have to order quickly, and we can sit there till
        4; but then we'll have to leave. Fine. We ordered within 5 minutes, 5
        dishes. That's when the problems started.


        First, they got my drink wrong (Yuzu tea instead of Maesil tea). I
        didn't say anything coz I like Yuzu, too. Then they gave us quite small
        portions of Banchans for 5 (missing some more items too, picture 1). We
        were understanding as they were in a rush. We were eating quite quickly.
        But 2 of our dishes were a bit late, and everything was hot. And we knew
        we had till 4, so we didn't mind. Around 3.05 pm, when we only finished
        little bit of our food (picture 2), they handed us the check. As you can
        see, the food wasn't even half eaten. They didn't even ask how the food
        was or if we needed anything. Weird, we thought. But we still gave them
        the payment. Even though we ordered separate dishes, I thought only I'd
        pay it and my friends can zelle me later, as that'd be quicker. So I
        asked for an itemized bill. They refused to give it. We then thought
        okay lets just finish it, and we would just not tip. [[Disclaimer: I tip
        almost always, but not when I get a zero service, and I'm all for
        livable wages for servers, so please don't be negative.]] When they came
        to get the sign, they straight up asked, 'No tip today? What's the
        problem?' - which we thought was quite rude. We tried to be polite, and
        didn't want any confrontation. But then they started making loud noises
        behind us. Worst thing is, there were a few other people in the
        restaurant (at least 2 or 3 tables), but they were being like that with
        us only. I don't know if it was coz we looked like tired grad students,
        or 2 of us had hijab on, or what. But it felt extremely uncomfortable.


        The food was, as always, really good. But I'd think more than twice
        before ever going back or recommending the place to anyone.

        Awful!  Korean BBQ/galbi (third picture) was thick and tough as
        rawhide.  Shrimp "tempura" was basically small fried shrimp (second
        picture), not the usual long pieces, and nothing like the photo on their
        menu (first picture).  Even worse, they didn't take the tail shell off
        and with the thick breading it was nearly impossible to get it off.  The
        waitress said her boyfriend just ends up eating the tail shell rather
        than trying to get it off!  Tempura sauce was off, very tangy, like
        vinegar.  Shrimp meal was $26 and when we complained to the waitress the
        best she offered was a side of dumplings, but we had enough of their
        lousy food and didn't want any more.  She wouldn't even knock 10 bucks
        of our nearly $100 meal.  We should have known by the restaurant being
        nearly empty at dinnertime on a Saturday.  Take my advice, don't chance
        it!
