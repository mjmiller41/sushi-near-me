        Potentially unsafe food: Rotten looking Broccoli stems in tempura the
        Manager could not explain.  Poorly wrapped sushi rolls with a shocking
        number of pieces having no fish inside, very little spiraled fish/rice,
        or being 70% fish fat (not the good kind i.e. Fatty Tuna).  Apparently
        there was a new employee.


        The manager got replacement rolls and half of the new rolls had the same
        issues.  The replacement rolls should have been checked by the Manager
        on duty before giving them to us.


        The manager on duty took off the bad Tempura and bad rolls. That was
        fair, but given that we may have eaten Rotten food in the tempura, the
        fact that we never did get good replacement rolls, and the overall
        broken up dining experience, I think a different approach would have
        been better.


        I am happy to discuss the problems we had with the Owner or Restaurant
        manager.  Outside of that, we will not be going back again.

        Left so disappointed. We got 5 different rolls and they did not taste
        fresh. The kids meals were a good value and a hit with the kids, but the
        two rolls that were $17 dollars each were drown in sauce and were not
        the quality we have had in the past, even metallic tasting . Dust on the
        walls and blinds left the atmosphere lacking. Our waitress was kind and
        tried to fix the rolls we ordered even blaming herself for them not
        being fresh. 1/5. I would not come back.

        Food was disgusting and inedible. Yakisoba noodles were just instant
        ramen noodles and “stir fried” vegetables weren’t cooked they were
        barely warmed up and absolutely nothing was seasoned. Spider roll was
        mid but I did eat all of it so meh. Server was kinda rude and definitely
        didnt serve us in anyway. At best she would be considered a food runner.
        When I asked to get the yakisoba garbage taken off the check she only
        discounted it 50% and slammed the check at me. This place has a nice
        interior but serves trash food and hires trash people. Went somewhere
        else afterwards to get some actual food. $20 for instant ramen is
        embarrassing.

        First time visiting, and the food was outstanding. Loved the ambiance,
        booths, and lighting were romantic. Waitstaff was complimentary and
        polite. Ordered the lettuce wraps, thinking they were prewrapped, but
        you prepared them yourself. The bento box comes with a good portion of
        food. Sushi rolls are also fulfilling. It's definitely worth visiting.
