        After dining at Yuraku a dozen times over the past half year, I can say
        that every experience has been consistently top-notch. The karaage
        chicken appetizer is amazingly crispy and the slices in the chirashi are
        both generous and deliciously fresh.


        I've brought business partners and loved ones here on multiple occasions
        and every visit has been a delectable delight.

        Incredible Sushi restaurant.  Staff were very friendly and attentive. 
        Plenty of tables in a cozy environment with great natural lighting. 
        Probably the best Philadelphia Roll I've ever enjoyed and the Saba Sushi
        was fantastic.

        The portions are huuuge! The mushroom soup is savory and salty; very
        delicious. The miso is great, too (hot, salty, savory, comforting). It
        is in a lovely contrast to the salad they also serve (it’s gingery,
        peanut-y, cold, crunchy, refreshing).


        The udon vegetable dish had amazing noodles and a yummy sauce, but some
        veggies were under/overcooked or bitter. Not the yummiest! Some were
        already cooled with the rest of the dish remaining quite hot. But it was
        okay because the truly enormous serving size made it very cost effective
        and the noodles/sauce were redeeming.


        Dessert was soooo good and the portion again was crazy big! Gigantic
        servings here, y’all. Like easily one entree could feed 2 (certainly).
        Some could probably split it between 3 people. The raspberry whip cream
        was special.


        It was really fun and scrumptious. I’m not usually big on fried things,
        but the fried ice cream was so good. The outside was crunchy, but some
        parts were soggy from the chocolate sauce (which personally I like!!)
        and the ice cream was good.


        Our waitress was lovely! She said I looked like Luna from Harry Potter
        🥰 She was very attentive and kind. Bubbly and easy to like. Great
        service!

        Our go to place for sushi in DC/DMV, if only I could give more stars. My
        wife and I have been here no less than 10 times in the last year, and
        have always been met with excellent food and outstanding service. My
        wife doesn’t eat much, so we usually like to order a few nigiris and
        share the omakase. The head chef is amazing in that he’ll split each
        sashimi/sushi serving in the omakase course in half so we can share it
        equally. They can also adjust the fishes served if you have any
        allergies or dietary restrictions. Our favorites here are the Japanese
        uni, scallop and madai. The ootoro and chuutoro are also exquisite and
        they make temakis with these cuts and a special poke sauce that are to
        die for.

        Good sushi option for the neighborhood. Plenty of seating options.


        Good quality fish and comes in a boat! Enjoyed the spicy Yellowtail,
        tuna avocado, hot fuzz, what a match, and sashimi salmon toro.

        Must have : Tuna nachos are amazing!

        Can skip - Gyoza: good but overly deep fried
