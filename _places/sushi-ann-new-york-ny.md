        Please BE CAREFUL what you order because they might serve more expensive
        menu and charge it.


        I ordered Sushi Omakase in Dinner counter, but they served Sushi &
        Sashimi Omakase which is more expensive than what we ordered.

        We did not check the order because of OMAKASE, but the final price was
        way higher than we were supposed to pay because they served different
        food for us.


        They said we should have mentioned if we had different menu from what we
        ordered.


        I agreed we should also have checked each food but STRONGLY RECOMMEND
        that all of customers keep in mind that every food is correctly served
        according to your order.

        Please BE CAREFUL what you order because they might serve more expensive
        menu and charge it.


        I ordered Sushi Omakase in Dinner counter, but they served Sushi &
        Sashimi Omakase which is more expensive than what we ordered.

        We did not check the order because of OMAKASE, but the final price was
        way higher than we were supposed to pay because they served different
        food for us.


        They said we should have mentioned if we had different menu from what we
        ordered.


        I agreed we should also have checked each food but STRONGLY RECOMMEND
        that all of customers keep in mind that every food is correctly served
        according to your order.

        Sushi Ann is one of my favorite higher end Japanese restaurants in New
        York City. I have dined here on two occasions both times during lunch
        and had fantastic experiences each visit. While the restaurant has a
        very minimalist decor on the inside, the sushi and service are both
        absolutely fantastic.

        My husband booked this reservation for us for Valentine's Day and we had
        to cancel it a few days beforehand due to emergency health issues. We
        then received a charge of $200 and the restaurant is refusing to refund
        it because of the 72-hour cancellation policy, which was only specified
        on the confirmation email and not on the initial Resy page.


        When trying to dispute this issue with the restaurant, my husband was
        not met with understanding or help even though our reservation was
        rebooked by another party. I'm really disappointed in the service and
        lack of accommodation and I just want to forewarn other guests in case
        they run into this issue as well. They are not only profiting from the
        people who booked our cancelled slot, but also from us who did not get
        to dine with them.

        Not recommended, Disappointing, more than overpriced. Lack of good
        communication and transparency by not providing a decent description of
        the different Omasake experiences and price schedule. Surprise bill of
        $260 per person for Omasake and water. The excessive price was not
        appropriate to the amount of food served, the culinary experience or the
        ambiance of the restaurant. We left stunned, hungry and wondering the
        many things we would have been able to do in NYC with that money. My
        favorite restaurant was Manhatta, a 60th floor impecable restaurant. I
        could have gone to Manhatta 3 times for the price of 1 night at boring
        Sushi Ann.

        Very sophisticated and traditional Japanese restaurant.


        The interior is well-decorated, a little dim, and quiet. The atmosphere
        is suitable for a date, meetings, or a lunch with friends. Servers were
        friendly, attentive, and prompt.


        I had omakase and the fish was freshhh. It was uni season when I
        visited, and they had several kinds on hand imported directly from
        Japan. The octopus was also extremely delicious. They also have a nice
        selection of wine and drinks! I sat by the sushi bar and the chef was
        very knowledgeable and friendly.


        While the price is on the higher end, the quality and service lives up
        to it.


        Overall, everything from the people to the food is wonderful. Will
        definitely come back!
