        I went there two different nights for supper.

        The first night, I had sushi. I ordered four rolls, Godzilla roll,
        Caribbean roll, Black Dragon roll, and one that was topped with mango.
        It was so good.

        The next night I ordered the spicy chicken pad thai. That had so much
        flavor, unbelievable. The wait staff were on top of their game both
        nights. I will definitely go back when I am in town.

        I went there two different nights for supper.

        The first night, I had sushi. I ordered four rolls, Godzilla roll,
        Caribbean roll, Black Dragon roll, and one that was topped with mango.
        It was so good.

        The next night I ordered the spicy chicken pad thai. That had so much
        flavor, unbelievable. The wait staff were on top of their game both
        nights. I will definitely go back when I am in town.

        The food has gone downhill the last couple years. I hope it gets better
        but not sure if it’s under new ownership or what’s happening. Not the
        same. Shrimp fried rice is just fried rice with shrimp on top, and not
        much shrimp.

        What's really cool about this place is their "Wall of Memories".


        The waitress/server was very nice and answered all my questions about
        the different dishes which was awesome because I ask a lot of questions
        all the time.


        The atmosphere was welcoming and chill with good music.


        The food was amazing. The Teriyaki Salmon with the sauce was phenomenal.
        Beyond words.


        The sushi rolls were so fresh, as was the sashimi. Wow.


        The bacon asparagus rice was phenomenal as well. So flavorful.
        Especially with the Yummy Sauce.


        I enjoyed my experience here immensely. Quite the hidden gem in Winona.
        I'm blown away.


        Thank you, Ocean Sushi for a beautiful experience for my first time
        visiting.


        Definitely worth the visit!!!!

        First time eating at this place. I absolutely loved it so does the
        husband, he's usually not a sushi person, he WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED! He
        ordered the Chicken hibachi, and the plate was as long as his arm,
        enough for two people to eat it. The husband like the fact that they
        separated the veggies from the chicken and rice. I ordered the pad Thai
        and the taste was right on, it wasn't too greasy, again the portions was
        enough to feed two people. And the platting for the sushi was so pretty,
        I couldn't even eat it. Most sushi place when you order sushi they put
        it all together where you cannot grab the sushi without touching the
        other kind of sushi. This one they, gave the sushi it's space. So when
        your chopsticks is grabbing the sushi, it's not touching the other
        sushi.

        I recently tried out Ocean Sushi and was thoroughly impressed!


        We ordered the Dragon Roll and the Fried California Roll, and both were
        absolutely delicious. The flavors were perfectly balanced, and the
        portions were generous—definitely filling! The presentation was
        beautiful, and the quality of the ingredients really stood out.


        The atmosphere of the restaurant was inviting, and the staff were
        friendly and attentive, making the overall experience even better. I’ll
        definitely be coming back to explore more of their menu.


        Highly recommend giving this place a try if you’re a sushi lover!!
