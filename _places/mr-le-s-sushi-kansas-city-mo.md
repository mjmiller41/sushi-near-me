        This place has been around since I was a kid and I know why! They are so
        consistent with the food, sushi and service! I usually get the Lennox
        roll because of the fried snapper and the Las Vegas roll that is lightly
        deep fried in the same batter that they use for the calamari! It's so
        thin and crispy. It just adds a little something extra special. I
        literally have to have the sushi every Wednesday for the rest of my
        life!!!!

        This place has been around since I was a kid and I know why! They are so
        consistent with the food, sushi and service! I usually get the Lennox
        roll because of the fried snapper and the Las Vegas roll that is lightly
        deep fried in the same batter that they use for the calamari! It's so
        thin and crispy. It just adds a little something extra special. I
        literally have to have the sushi every Wednesday for the rest of my
        life!!!!

        We stopped by Mr. Les for a quick lunch. It's a bit of a hole in the
        wall place, decor is scarce but the waiter and waitresss are all nice.
        You mark what you want on the menu which I found helpful as the menu is
        quite vast.


        I ordered the Vietnamese coffee which was an absolute delight. Strong
        coffee with a not too sweet but still balanced taste, which they serve
        in a cup that you mix and pour over ice. There were some coffee grounds
        in mine but it didn't effect the experience one bit. The bento box is a
        great deal at 15 bucks that comes with soup, salad, a protein, rice and
        a sushi roll. The miso soup was well seasoned and delicious, the house
        salad was made with romaine which I appreciated over the traditional
        iceberg and the salad dressing was a nice miso/sweet dressing. I picked
        chicken teriyaki which again was perfectly seasoned and the chicken was
        well cooked. My only disappointment was the sushi itself, the filling
        was a bit bland and the rice was crunchy. The spicy mayo was also sweet
        which I wasn't a huge fan of.


        Overall they had solid dishes and it was a good experience, but I
        wouldn't go back for the sushi

        My daughter picked sushi for her birthday dinner, we got edamame & crab
        rangoons for some starters, and they were good. We also ordered chicken
        lo mein and 3 rolls; the volcano roll(baked), Lisa roll, and Jessica
        roll. The volcano & Lisa rolls were by far the best 2 of 3 that we got,
        we wouldn't get the lo mein again as it was lacking in flavor. For the
        price, it's an ok sushi spot.

        Really good food at a reasonable price. Staff was friendly and
        supportive of their customers.


        Got the General Tsao’s, beef lo mein, shrimp lo mein, vegetables with
        beef, Vietnamese pho #1, and two fried sushi.


        General Tsao’s is really good. Get it extra spicy, makes it just right
        rather than just being sweet chicken. Getting it spicy doesn’t make it
        intolerable for those that don’t love spice, my twin 9 year old
        granddaughters had no issue with the spice and throughly enjoyed the
        dish.


        Beef lo mein and shrimp lo mein are good dishes. The dishes do taste
        different aside from the protein, both tastes were enjoyed by my family.
        Lo mein dishes were more filling than the other dishes we got.


        Vegetables with beef was awesome. The cook on the vegetables was
        perfect, just the right texture as they still had body without being
        undercooked super crunchy things.


        Vietnamese Pho #1 was really tasty. I love getting the vegetables
        separate so I can add them when ready, it makes sure I can eat them when
        they’re perfect. Bringing the two seasonings to the tables with the dish
        let me spice it up as I wanted it. Really enjoyed this dish.


        The fried sushi was really good, no complaints. We did appreciate the
        entrees more than the sushi, on our second visit we just got entrees we
        wanted vice getting sushi a second time.


        Great restaurant to get good Chinese and Vietnamese dishes without
        breaking the bank, highly recommend.
