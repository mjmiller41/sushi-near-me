        I thought the sushi was good for Temecula standards!  The rice on the
        rolls were a little much but overall still fresh.  The ramen is fairly
        basic (fine for us); no egg, seaweed, scallion, etc.  Just wish the
        broth was less salty.


        Overall, not bad for a local sushi spot.  Prices were reasonable and
        service was very good.  Would return.

        My partner and I used to love eating here, but we won't be coming back
        anymore. When you dine in, it's usually pretty good, but the last few
        times, we have had to order take out and both times it was awful. Our
        $60+ order food (not including the tip) was bland, didn't taste right,
        and completely fell a part. The rice was mushy and the rolls crumbled a
        part making a mess. This happened the last time too, but we thought it
        was a one time thing and gave them another shot. The rolls didn't taste
        right either, one was a crunch and the other was a fresh fish roll.
        Usually the crunch roll is amazing, but this time it was really bad. Our
        shrimp fried rice was bland and flavorless as well. The rice was still
        partially white and it wasn't as big of a serving like usual. I'm not
        sure what has happened over the past few months here, but I hope it gets
        better.

        They need to review the ADA laws regarding service animals. A service
        animal is not required to sit outside, and is allowed anywhere public is
        allowed, including in the main dining area. My son with special needs
        has preferences to sit in a booth and they only allow us to sit in the
        back portion of the restaurant with no booths. I would happily raise
        their rating if they were to not discriminate against the disabled but
        for now till they figure out the actual law, it will remain a 3.

  What Customers Are Saying About This Sushi Spot$$$Visitors to this Temecula
  sushi restaurant often praise the fresh and tasty rolls, with many
  highlighting the quality of sashimi and edamame as standout favorites that
  make for a satisfying meal. While some folks note that the service is quick
  and attentive, especially during dine-in visits, there are occasional mentions
  of takeout orders falling short in flavor and presentation. Overall, the spot
  gets high marks for its reasonable prices and welcoming environment, though a
  few have pointed out areas for improvement like consistency in preparation.
  It's clear that regulars appreciate the variety of options for Japanese places
  near me, but opinions vary on specifics like seasoning in certain dishes. In a
  casual setting like this, the general buzz remains positive, encouraging
  newcomers to give it a try for an authentic sushi experience.
