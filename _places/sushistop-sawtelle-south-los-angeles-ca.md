        Love the causal ambiance though it can be quite loud when they turn up
        the overhead music (maybe by accident?).  Food is still DECENT and it is
        affordable for student pricing given how expensive sushi can be on the
        west side. But yeah, portions seem smaller than before.


        TIP: post on Instagram to get 10% off your bill and a free dessert! They
        have this one the specials menu in each table but you just gotta show
        your server =)


        Staff is welcoming and the inside is still small with small tables along
        the sides (mostly 2 seaters) and then many high chairs surrounding the
        center chef sushi making stations.


        Sadly, those amazing mini udon and mini curry bowls are NO more at the
        South Sawtelle location :(


        This still gets busy around lunch hour. But thankfully there is a free 2
        hr multi level parking lot in the shared shopping center. But if you
        want there’s always paid metered parking along Sawtelle.


        Restrooms: 2 gender neutral ones.

        I will start off with what I did order was great ! Dynamite Scallop
        rolls , Shrimp rolls that were delicious and the udon was okay but the
        rolls saved the day. As for service is why we won’t be back. Multiple
        items on our order were forgotten because they were never rang in. They
        also had drunk workers there drinking that were from a different
        location that preceded to harass my fiancé and I trying to get us to
        drink and take sake shots. My wife doesn’t drink and I’m practicing a
        more sober life style and when no staff stepped in and laughed instead
        it made things more frustrating when we kept telling him no. We were
        left waiting for 20mins on food that never got put in and then for that
        were told we’re going to get dessert.. bill came out and we were charged
        for the dessert. After a long day at the office it was the last thing we
        needed so we paid and left. Our server was no were to be seen and the
        workers were in the back with the other drunk employees. Super
        disappointed

        DO NOT ORDER THE UNI


        I knew better. I did it anyway. Ordered on Uber eats. All the other
        items were standard. Decent/good value like you expect from SushiStop.
        The uni was listed as a *new* item and I fell for it. Tasted like
        licking the inside of an aquarium that hasn't had its water changed in a
        year. My dog wouldn't even eat it so I had to throw it in the trash
