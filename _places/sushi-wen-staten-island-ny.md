        What a wonderful place! Not only is the food delicious, but they made a
        little mix up on our order, so the hostess walked over the correct order
        herself!  She didn't want us to have to wait for the delivery guy again!
        Exceptional customer service!

        A small cafe, with about 15 seating tables. When we arrived, we were the
        only visitors. The rolls were served in about 15 minutes. In general, it
        was delicious, but for me they were salty and I would like a more
        memorable taste so that you could eat and enjoy it directly, I lacked
        sophistication in taste. We also took fried vanilla ice cream and it was
        so fun!

        BingBing and the other female waitress were both incredibly friendly,
        kind, and social! We came in very late but they accommodated us with no
        issues at all and even allowed us the option of ordering more food even
        as they were preparing to close up for the night, which we really
        appreciated! The rolls and mackerel sashimi were all very fresh and the
        food arrived quickly and was aesthetically pleasing. We will definitely
        come back next time to try their wide ranging selection of foods! One
        area of improvement is to add just a bit more of the lobster salad in
        the green tea roll, for the other ingredients easily overpowered the
        taste of the lobster. Asides from that, we definitely had a pleasurable
        experience!


        Thank you for reading and best of luck! (:
