        Deliciously good food. There are several different restaurants with
        different price points in this restaurant. We had a good meal and we’re
        thoroughly impressed with the quality. We ate at HIYA and then decided
        to go to love on the run for dessert and a sushi roll . The shrimp
        tempura roll from love on the rum was one of the best I’ve ever had and
        I honestly wish we just would’ve eaten dinner there to begin with. My
        kids loved the donuts and ice cream.

        I wish I had this restaurant back home because this is the best
        restaurant I’ve ever eaten at. I’m visiting D.C and went to here to do
        their BBQ omakase and this was the best fine dining experience I’ve ever
        had. Service was extremely quick our food started coming out within 3
        minutes of ordering it. There was constantly someone passing by to
        refill my drinks, and the food was just amazing I can’t even begin to
        describe how good it was id fly back here from Florida just to eat here
        honestly.

        I come here for lunch at least once or twice a month since they started
        offering it, and every visit has been an extraordinary experience. The
        unmatched quality and freshness of their ingredients truly stand out.
        From the first bite, it’s clear they use only the finest products to
        craft their incredible dishes. The flavors are pure, authentic, and
        absolutely unforgettable.


        The staff is just as remarkable-kind, attentive, and always going above
        and beyond to make guests feel welcome. A special shoutout to Robin,
        whose exceptional hospitality and expert recommendations have made every
        visit a perfect 10 out of 10!


        If you’re looking for an exceptional Japanese dining experience that
        pairs impeccable food with world-class service, Love, Makoto is a
        must-visit.

        Beloved BBQ

        Highly recommend this Japanese BBQ spot! The meat is incredibly tender
        and juicy, though the portion sizes are on the smaller side. If it’s
        your first visit, definitely try the meat tower — it’s a fun and tasty
        experience. The staff were also very kind and welcoming, which made the
        meal even more enjoyable.

        I got the Omakase and all I have to say that it was perfect. The way
        each course was brought out and the orders from the chef all made it
        into the meal it was. It was all unbelievably fresh and high quality. It
        is definitely a place that I have to go back to. One of the people in my
        group didn't even get the experience and they still brought a cherry out
        for them. It was a touching sign that shows this chefs love for his
        menu.
