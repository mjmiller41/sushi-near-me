        Our server Dawn J. was absolutely incredible. She recommended the peanut
        butter torte dessert and a handful of the signature sushi rolls.
        Overall, I had a fantastic experience and I will be returning. The food
        was exquisite. I ordered the mushroom linguine while my friends ordered
        the sushi rolls. Mushroom linguine had a perfect sauce and the pasta
        could not have been better. 10/10. Thank you!

        Amazing views of the Bay and Channelside. Great for a romantic evening
        or a night w the friends and family. Great food at the right price 😄
        Amazing selection of sushi rolls, appetizers and entrees to choose from.
        The dessert and drink menus were up to par! Wish the servers were more
        attentive and the place is very lively and clean.

        The entrance to the underground parking area isn't very noticeable; to
        find it, I had to use a 15-minute parking spot and reconnoiter on foot. 
        Other than that, the view was relaxing and, for a riverfront,
        surprisingly uncluttered.  My boneless Citrus  Chicken entree had very
        little citrus tang to it but the accompanying salad was delicious and
        had some unexpected and pleasing flavors.  The key lime pie is light and
        airy: I have no idea how they slice a key lime thin enough to be
        transparent, but it works.

        First time visiting Jackson’s since they changed their menu options. Was
        pretty disappointed. The Brussels were not done. The selections didn’t
        satisfy. The atmosphere and water views are always great but the food
        was not good. The Drinks were GREAT.

        Nestled along the stunning waterfront of Harbour Island, Jackson's
        Bistro, Bar & Sushi is a gem that beautifully captures the essence of
        fine dining. The moment you step in, you’re greeted by sweeping views of
        the sparkling Tampa Riverwalk, setting the stage for an unforgettable
        meal.


        Now, let’s talk about the food! The menu is a delightful fusion of
        seafood, steak, and sushi, catering to a variety of dietary
        preferences—there are plenty of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free
        options to please everyone at the table. I couldn’t resist starting with
        the Angry Edamame, which quickly became a table favorite. It was the
        perfect blend of heat and flavor, setting a high bar for the rest of the
        meal. The sushi? Fresh and vibrant, each piece practically melted in my
        mouth.


        For those who appreciate a good drink, Jackson’s boasts an impressive
        selection of fine wines from around the world, available by the glass or
        bottle. I found it hard to choose just one, so sampling a few was a
        delightful indulgence!


        The service was exemplary—attentive without being intrusive—which made
        the experience all the more enjoyable. Plus, if you’re dining with your
        furry friend, you’ll be pleased to know that this spot is dog-friendly!


        With a price range of $25-$50 per person, Jackson’s Bistro offers a
        fantastic experience that feels worth every penny. And if you’re in need
        of a private space for a special occasion, their private dining room is
        a unique feature that adds a touch of elegance. All in all, whether
        you’re out for a romantic dinner or a gathering with friends, Jackson's
        is a must-visit.
