        So, you walk into this place at the end of April, and the first thing
        you see? Christmas. Full on Christmas. Tree, ornaments, snowflakes still
        hanging like they’ve never left. And in the background? Westlife’s “My
        Love,” playing on a loop like it’s 2001 again. Not just once—the whole
        time you’re there. And yes, the sweet older gentleman working the floor
        is singing along. Every word. Every high note.


        Now, despite the word “sushi” in the name, let me save you the trouble:
        there is no sushi. Not even a lonely spicy tuna roll. But once the pad
        thai shows up, all is forgiven. It’s really good. Like, why haven’t I
        been coming here all along good.


        And after a few bites, you find yourself kind of vibing with the music.
        Maybe even mouthing the chorus with the waiter. The snowflakes start to
        feel kind of charming. The slightly sticky table? Adds to the
        experience.


        Would I go back? Absolutely. Just maybe not for sushi, but definitely
        for the pad thai, the unintentional karaoke, and the year round holiday
        cheer.

        I'm pregnant at the moment, and I thought ordering a  papaya salad would
        be good as I've had papaya salads at other places, and there's never
        been a problem. I was wrong. their menu description does not state any
        meat/ sea food. When the salad arrived, I started eating. After a few
        bites in, I noticed a raw crab leg, and I thought it might be cross-
        contamination. I took it out. Then I digged through the salad more, and
        I noticed that the whole salad had bits and pieces of raw crab. Now I'm
        afraid that I'm going to get sick.

        I recently dined at Cherry Thai cafe and had an amazing experience. The
        highlight of my meal was the shrimp tom yum with Thai hot spice. The
        flavors were perfectly balanced, with a spicy kick that left a lasting
        impression. The shrimp was cooked to perfection and added a delightful
        seafood element to the dish. The ambiance of the cafe was cozy and
        inviting, making it a great place to enjoy a delicious meal. The staff
        was friendly and attentive, ensuring that my dining experience was
        top-notch. I highly recommend Cherry Thai cafe for anyone looking for
        authentic Thai cuisine that is bursting with flavor.

        Upon entering, the waitress was friendly right away. She is Thai but
        speaks English fine.

        I ordered Pineapple Curry with Chicken and brown rice. Although I
        ordered it Thai hot, it was medium at best, but still quite tasty. I'm
        happy they serve brown rice!

        They do not have a liquor license, so no Sing Ha beer to have with your
        meal.

        There are lots of Door Dash drivers coming to pick up food, so it's
        popular.

        I'd return.
