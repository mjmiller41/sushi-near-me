        Kano Cafe is a Solid place to stop and get some pho. It was spicy and
        Definitely full of flavor. Our order was served to us very quickly. The
        staff was very kind and courteous towards myself and my family and were
        very attentive. The wings were cooked perfectly and the sauce they
        coated them with was tangy and delicious. They are in the old Yoshi
        building and have some work to do as far as making the building their
        own, but everything was still very clean and organized. But the food for
        sure is top notch. Definitely one of the best in Temple for Vietnamese
        cuisine. I would highly recommend this place for a large family dinner
        or even just a quick bite to eat. I will definitely be bringing my
        family back here

        Been waiting for 4 months for them to reopen!  They never updated the
        information online or phone message.

        I drove by one day and saw it was open!


        We had lunch there.


        The staff were very friendly and efficient.

        The interior wasn’t anything special. The place was clean and in order.


        The food was just so-so.


        We had appetizers;

        Shrimp Tempura - Lightly Battered Shrimp Deep Fried!  They were a little
        limp or soggy. They had a good taste.


        Crab Rangoon- Crab and Cream Cheese in a Fried Wonton! Crispy and
        flavorful.


        Our Meals were:

        Bento Box,

        Grilled Steak, Shrimp Tempura,

        4 pieces California Roll, Ginger Salad, Fried Dumplings, and Rice.

        Grilled steak was flavorful but tough!


        Bento Box,

        Katsu Chicken, Shrimp Tempura,

        4 pieces California Roll, Ginger Salad, Fried Dumplings, and Rice.

        Chicken was Dry and Tough!


        Overall it was OK but I don’t need to come back.

        Kano Cafe just served me the best sushi and Tuna nigiri I’ve had in my
        whole life. I eat sushi probably twice a week and I have for years, I’ve
        been to a lot of good spots and nothing amounts to how amazing this food
        was. Even the rice was the best sushi rice I’ve ever had. Super excited
        to come back and eat the Pho and more sushi. 10/10 recommend.
