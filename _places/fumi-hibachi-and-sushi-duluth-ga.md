        Went day after Christmas.   Was not very busy. However, server was very
        knowledgeable and took very accurate orders, which surprised me since he
        did not write anything down.  The food was amazing.   Served hot and
        extremely flavorful.   The only exception was it seemed to me that it
        was pricey.   I live in the DMV, and comparing what I  normally would
        pay for four adults was a little more than normal.   Would go again,
        however.   I do recommend a try if you are from out of town.

        Went day after Christmas.   Was not very busy. However, server was very
        knowledgeable and took very accurate orders, which surprised me since he
        did not write anything down.  The food was amazing.   Served hot and
        extremely flavorful.   The only exception was it seemed to me that it
        was pricey.   I live in the DMV, and comparing what I  normally would
        pay for four adults was a little more than normal.   Would go again,
        however.   I do recommend a try if you are from out of town.

        I would like to first warn people about this restaurant. I went there
        tonight and I ordered my granddaughter a kids meal that somehow came to
        a total cost of $18. What they don’t tell you is when you order a kids
        hibachi you have to pay an extra three dollars for the fried rice and
        then they charge you three dollars for a drink which brings a shrimp
        hibachi kids meal to a total of $18 Plus tax. This is wrong in every
        sense of the word the only place I’ve ever eaten in America, where kids
        meal cost $18 and doesn’t even include a drink. I gave the manager the
        benefit of the doubt to correct this and fix it, and she simply smiled
        at me and said that she has to pay a lot for her kids meal when she goes
        to Chick-fil-A. I’m not making this up. she literally compared a
        Chick-fil-A kids meal to the $18 cost that I was charged for my
        granddaughter’s kids meal tonight unbelievable!  Lastly, I ordered the
        steak and shrimp. I had to interrupt the Chef while he was cooking my
        steak on hibachi to tell him hello!! I would like my steak to be medium.
        He was just gonna cook it to whatever point he felt happy. He ended up
        cooking it well done even after I told him medium for some reason he
        also felt necessary to cook the shrimp for over 10 minutes. Anyone who
        has any type of culinary experience knows that shrimp can be fully
        cooked and under two minutes. The final insult to injury was they
        charged me automatic gratuity because I had a party of four they count
        my one year-old grandson as an individual even though he didn’t order
        anything except a drink and they charged him three dollars for a
        lemonade. I will be attaching a photo of my bill as evidence of
        everything. I just said so that when the owner decides to respond to
        this and say it never happened, I actually have the proof.  Again, I
        spoke to the female manager who was on duty and gave her the opportunity
        to correct my issues and concerns and she told me a Chick-fil-A story
        and smiled and pretty much said, That’s just the way it is.  In summary,
        this was my experience and I wanted to share it. You make your bed you
        make the best decision for you. Good luck. I paid $110.00 for two adult
        hibachi’ and a kids meal and one xtra kids drink. Outrageous charges!!!

        I come to this place once if not twice a week! Today, I will never
        recommend no one to ever come here. My family and I was sat at 1:43pm
        and my newborn needed changing I went to the restroom to change her and
        was approached about how I needed to to hurry up because food needs to
        be in by 2pm. If we needed to rush why was we ever sat at a table? There
        needs to be a cut off time for seating. It ruined our whole day!

        I will start by saying. I normally don't write reviews. However, I am
        writing this review because I have always enjoyed dining at FUMI. It's
        been a while though. My recent experience here was disappointing. I
        ordered hibachi shrimp and scallops. I noticed the portion has decreased
        and their prices have increased. I wasn't so excited about it. Also, the
        hibachi chef chopped up my scallops which I had never seen done before.
        I didn't see how many scallops I should have gotten. I can say the sushi
        was good. The chef used the same utensils to cook everything. Raw
        chicken, steak, shrimp. That's concerning. I think I will stick to
        Volcano Steak and Sushi. I hope management will do a better job training
        their staff.
