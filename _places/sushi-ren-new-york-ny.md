        Only have gotten delivery and the sushi is amazing. They do NOT cheap
        out on the fish, the rolls are fresh and the rice is perfectly seasoned
        and cooked!


        The few times I’ve ordered, I’ve mostly gotten salmon rolls, Alaska
        rolls, or spicy tuna. All are amazing, they really pack in the fish!!
        And the lunch deals are unbeatable.


        Highly recommend doing the 3 roll combo for lunch to get the best bang
        for your buck.

        We came here for the first time. We got a large hot sake to kick off our
        dinner. It was nice and warm, but just an average quality sake. We
        started with their New Karaage, and it was phenomenal. The batter was
        thin and airy. It was crispy on the outside and the chicken thigh piece
        on the inside was incredibly juicy. We also got Spicy Girl Roll and
        Green River. The Spicy Girl Roll was quite nice. However, the Green
        River was a bit strange because of the black olives. I don’t think the
        black olives go well with raw fish. I also got a salmon roe sushi and a
        scallop sushi. Both sushi was very good. Especially the scallop one. It
        was so big, fresh and sweet. It was delicious. Last but not least, the 
        Nabe Yaki Udon was humongous. It has scallops, imitation crab,
        fishcakes, broccoli, zucchini, pieces of chicken breast, carrots, an
        egg, and 2 pieces of tempura shrimps. The broth was nice and clear, but
        was a bit fishy. All the ingredients were quite nice. The scallops were
        nice, but I felt like there was sand in them. The broccoli was a bit
        mushy. The batter of the shrimp tempura was a bit thick. Otherwise, it
        had good value for the price. Overall, I think it’s a nice restaurant
        with nice servers.

        We are so glad we found sushi ren after visiting the MET. The lychee
        martinis were uniquely chilled like a slushee but a great mix! The sushi
        rolls were so affordable and fresh, we ordered six like the Dallas roll
        and shrimp tempura.

        Sushi Ren is such a cute local spot! The place is really clean and has a
        cozy vibe—perfect for catching up with friends. The sushi was fresh and
        tasty, and the staff were super friendly and welcoming, which made the
        whole experience really nice.

        Chicken teriyaki was great!! Best in the area.


        The only downside was that the back “employees only” door kept opening,
        and a strong smell of smoke started coming through to our table.
        Luckily, we were done eating by then, but it was pretty unpleasant.
        Definitely a bummer.


        I’d still recommend checking it out for the good food and chill
        atmosphere, just try not to sit near the back!

        The food used to be great. Not now, it’s not fresh. The soup smelled. We
        threw it away. This is Supposed to be miso soup. I have never seen brown
        miso soup before.
