        Just had a to go order from this place and the owner is amazing. You can
        tell by the initial conversation that this person cares about the food
        he makes and the people who come in. The food was some of the freshest
        sushi we’ve ever had. He gave us some extra drinks and candy’s which
        were not expected and the portions were generous to say the least. My gf
        introduced me to this place because she goes here for her lunch and it
        was definitely worth the drive. Would definitely go out of my way to
        come eat here again.

        Just had a to go order from this place and the owner is amazing. You can
        tell by the initial conversation that this person cares about the food
        he makes and the people who come in. The food was some of the freshest
        sushi we’ve ever had. He gave us some extra drinks and candy’s which
        were not expected and the portions were generous to say the least. My gf
        introduced me to this place because she goes here for her lunch and it
        was definitely worth the drive. Would definitely go out of my way to
        come eat here again.

        I had the pleasure of finding this gem while getting lunch near my
        office. I was immediately greeted by the owner, who was incredibly kind
        and hospitable. He offered me a bottled water while I waited for my food
        (which wasn't a long wait at all), and he was very willing to
        accommodate my dietary preferences. When I opened my box, I couldn't
        believe all of the extra goodies I got: not only did I have my large
        veggie roll, but also an apple, seaweed salad, 4 different types of
        Japanese candy,  and more. It was like a whole bento!


        We had a great conversation, and I instantly knew I'd be coming back
        regularly for when I'm craving a good veggie roll. Highly recommend
        checking out this underrated gem!!

        The restaurant looked closed, but I’m glad we went in anyway. The owner
        was such a kind man and dinner was great! The portions were huge and the
        extras like the edamame, crab salad, seaweed salad were so thoughtful.
        We got the shrimp tempura roll (favorite) and spicy scallop roll (the
        best I’ve had in YEARS) as well as spicy tuna and California. All were
        huge and delicious! We planned on ordering six rolls, but the owner said
        four would fill us up (party of 3) and he was right! We are stuffed! He
        gave us some candy to end the meal and sent my daughter home with fresh
        flowers. Will definitely come again next time we are in the area!

        Bit quirky setup and pretty small restaurant but the taste is phenomenal
        and very close to the one I had in Japan. I’ve seen many reviews says it
        is tasteless but from what they order I can tell they are looking for
        American roll not the authentic Japanese sushi. If you are looking for
        heavy sauce to ruin the original fish taste then you are going to be
        disappointed. If you are looking for genuine sushi/sashimi made by an
        old chef this place is an interesting choice.
