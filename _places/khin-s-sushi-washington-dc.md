        Echoing other reviews that the poke bowl is a robbery. The to-go package
        for the bowl is only 1/3 full. It is a laughably small portion of food…
        and most of these ingredients are so cheap. We would love to be a repeat
        customer, but this simply is not enough food

        Echoing other reviews that the poke bowl is a robbery. The to-go package
        for the bowl is only 1/3 full. It is a laughably small portion of food…
        and most of these ingredients are so cheap. We would love to be a repeat
        customer, but this simply is not enough food

        I have truly never felt so robbed. $18.50 for a poke bowl, that had just
        enough food to satisfy a 2 year old. The first disappointment is that
        they did not have/offer half the toppings that other Poke establishments
        have. Then, the tub where they contain the rice had flies flying around
        it. The protein marinade tasted like soy sauce only. I did inform the
        owner/employee about my feelings. His response was “that is a lot, we
        serve sushi sizes usually”. I told him it was not a lot, not even enough
        to be honest. I am just disappointed and will never revisit this
        establishment. You have been warned…!  I should have payed attention to
        other reviewers regarding this level of Shrinkflation!

        Highly recommend! This restaurant has great sushi (and boba/ice cream)
        for such a good price compared to other locations. The servers are
        friendly and make the sushi in front of you pretty quickly!

        I recently had the pleasure of dining at Khin's Sushi in Navy Yard, and
        I must say it was an extraordinary experience. From the moment I walked
        in, the ambiance was inviting and cozy, setting the stage for a
        delightful meal.


        Let's talk about the food. The sushi at Khin's is decent. Every piece
        was expertly crafted, showcasing the freshest ingredients and a perfect
        balance of flavors. The fish was incredibly fresh, and the rice had the
        ideal texture-neither too sticky nor too dry. I especially enjoyed their
        signature rolls, such as the Dragon Roll and the Spicy Tuna Roll, which
        were bursting with unique combinations of flavors.


        As for the price, I found it to be very reasonable considering the
        quality and amount of food. In fact, my total bill for the meal, which
        cost $32.97, felt like a steal given the incredible dining experience I
        had.


        The location of Khin's Sushi in Navy Yard is fantastic, especially for
        those attending a game or event in the area. It's conveniently situated
        near popular attractions and within walking distance of the Navy Yard
        Metro station. The restaurant itself is clean, well-maintained, and has
        a modern yet cozy atmosphere.


        In conclusion, I recommend Khin's Sushi in Navy Yard to all sushi
        enthusiasts and food lovers. With its delicious sushi, good service, and
        reasonable prices, this restaurant is undoubtedly a hidden gem. Whether
        you're a local or just visiting the area, don't miss out on the
        opportunity to indulge in an unforgettable sushi experience at Khin's!

        I absolutely love this place. I frequent it probably too often! The
        sushi is SO fresh, the poke bowls are SOOO good and the staff is very
        friendly. Writing this review makes me want to order for dinner I
        already am craving it again! The prices are very reasonable and it’s so
        close. Highly recommended!
