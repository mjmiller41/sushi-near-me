        We’ve been to this restaurant a few times now, and each visit has been
        consistently wonderful, never failing to impress. The food is always
        top-notch, from the tender, perfectly cooked chicken to the flavorful
        fried rice and the mouthwatering sushi. One standout item that I always
        look forward to is the yellowtail sashimi – it’s always incredibly fresh
        and bursting with flavor. The ginger dressing on the side salad is also
        one of the best I’ve ever tasted; it’s tangy, yet smooth, with just the
        right amount of spice.


        That being said, there was one small downside to this visit. While the
        food was amazing as always, the chef seemed a little rushed and didn’t
        put as much effort into the usual tricks and playful banter that make
        the experience feel more interactive and fun. I understand that the
        restaurant can get busy, but I do enjoy the entertainment factor of the
        meal. I come here not just for the delicious food, but also for the
        show. It’s always a bonus when the chef goes the extra mile to engage
        the adults as well as the kids. Hopefully, on our next visit, the chef
        will bring back a little more of that playful energy we’ve come to
        expect.


        Overall, though, it’s always a great experience. The atmosphere, food
        quality, and service are all fantastic, and I look forward to many more
        visits in the future.

        Service was great and our table was very clean. The room has a cozy,
        comfortable feel to it and the restaurant is perfectly placed as the
        entrance is right in front of the water. This is nice because either
        before you dine or right after, a nice waterside stroll is only a step
        away.


        The actual hibachi entertainment was subpar. Our chef did nothing
        special nor out of the ordinary. We got the onion on fire that turns
        into the "choo-choo" train and we got a rice ball toss to the mouth.
        Other than that, he prepared the food as normal but no other exciting
        feature for that Father's Day lunch.


        The cost seems pretty in line, and gratuity is not a huge surprise for a
        party of 6. I would say that it is worth a try if you've never had
        hibachi. But for anyone seasoned with this style of dining, there are
        other places that really put the wow factor into it.


        Our server was incredible though I didn't catch her name and the food
        was nicely seasoned and worth another visit. Just not with the hibachi.

        Came here for my sons birthday & the chef for habachi seems like he 
        didn’t do much tricks as I expected but overall still a great experience
        for my kids. The food tasted great except for the steak which didn’t
        have much flavor and was overcooked. I would avoid ordering that. The
        whole time our kind waiter checked on us multiple times refilling our
        drinks making sure we were comfortable.

        This is one of my favorite spots for Sushi, but I have to admit I
        haven't been here in a few years, probably since Covid.. I would still
        give the sushi top marks.  We had the Hot Mama & the Marilyn, we also
        had the combination fried rice which taste good but was a little shy of
        protein.  Now they have a Martini called the Lychee Martini OMG!!!
        LOVE.  The scenery is beautiful if you can tolerate the heat and be
        seated outside.  All in all I give them a solid 4 Stars because of the
        fried  rice and the tables inside are starting to get a little on the
        worn side but other than that still a great spot for Sushi.
