        The food here is simply delicious! I don't eat sushi but they have other
        stuff available for those who needs their food cooked.  I definitely
        will keep coming here.  Totally worth the money.  The ambiance is quite
        mix. It's a chill place but also sporty as they show sports. So great
        place to go with friends and family.

        The food is like other sushi places, I would rate it overall good. The
        atmosphere is shopping center vibes but good enough for a lunch break or
        a quick date night. Lots of TVs and happy hours available.

        Honestly I’ve been coming here for more than a few years and every
        single time I come here the service is absolutely terrible however I
        really like the food, last night I invited a bunch of my coworkers out
        here and we experienced the worst service I’ve ever experienced at any
        other restaurant, first off the menu doesn’t include any of the prices
        your better checking online to make sure that you’re okay with what
        you’re paying for but regardless we knew somewhat of what we were
        ordering everything was fine until closer to the end of the meal when
        the server started to make mistakes with our food, 24.99 for yellow tail
        for 2pc and then again 24.99 for a 8pc is ridiculous meanwhile we
        ordered a second round of rolls and when the server brings me the roll
        tells me that this is a valley roll confidently and I let her know this
        isn’t a valley roll ( I ordered the same roll prior for my first roll)
        and brought me something completely different but instead of offering it
        to the table proceeded to offer it to another table then took another 20
        mins for my roll for it to be half made like 50% of the roll was missing
        because they wanted to rush it out. Then when we first ordered we got
        spicy garlic edamame that took 35 mins to come out meanwhile everyone’s
        entrees had already come out. I don’t blame the server because I feel as
        she was doing her best but the other person whom seemed to be the
        manager was the problem when we told him about the rolls & the check he
        made a loud grunting sound like he was annoyed mind you there was only
        one other table with us in the restaurant but when receiving the check
        is when we decided that this was just ridiculous. My friends check was
        split into multiple items like a 1/2 coke 1/2 coke 1/2 dragon roll 1/2
        dragon roll and also insisted on doing a gratuity tip, then proceeded to
        hand my other friend two separate checks when she only needed one so
        that she’d have to double tip. As much as I love the food here the
        service continues to keep getting worse. Please rethink coming here.

        This place has the worst customer service. The food is great, which is
        why we gave them three chances. However, we waited over an hour and only
        received one of our rolls. When we asked about the rest of our order,
        they said they'd check but nothing ever happened. Even after following
        up, our order still wasn’t made. It honestly felt like we were being
        unreasonable for simply asking. Waiting an hour for sushi is ridiculous.
        When we decided to cancel our order, it felt like we were the ones in
        the wrong. They didn’t even offer a discount for the inconvenience or
        apologize to us directly, nor did they explain the situation. This place
        has really gone downhill. I wish them the best, but I won’t be coming
        back.
