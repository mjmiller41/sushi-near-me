        I - I love this restaurant so much it's my absolute favorite if I want
        to get high quality comfort food!

        D- Don't skip coming here if you live near or are coming in from out of
        town. The environment is very welcoming!

        E- Every time I come here I am greeted by reliant and efficient service
        that has seriously never brought me down.

        A- All the food is so delicious!! The pink lady is my go-to order and
        seriously every time I put the roll in my mouth I am transported to my
        personal heaven.


        This family owned sushi restaurant is the best restaurant in the area.

        I don’t know if the day you order, chef cooking, or flow of business is
        what has determined the taste of take out food but it has been hit or
        miss. When this place first opened it was AMAZING. After awhile I
        ordered on a Sunday and the food was terrible. Some time has passed so I
        decided to try again and unfortunately the food is disappointing again
        yet last Saturday it was perfect. Today  our Gyoza rolls were burnt and
        the Vegetable lo mein was tasteless w very little veggies. They can’t
        seem to get the General Tso chicken to our liking.. despite ordering x x
        spicy the sauce is SWEET w no heat at all. I LOVE Asian food and hope
        they get it together.

        All the dishes we had were beautifully prepared with very fresh
        ingredients, vegetables and seafood in our cases. A very good
        restaurant. In my experience the best in this area. And the prices were
        very fair

        Excellent meals for our group . Prices were very fair and the place was
        very clean with an appealing atmosphere. Definitely going to make this a
        regular lunch/dinner stop. Everyone had both appetizers and dinners. 
        Tasted all the plates and was very impressed.  The service was very good
        and friendly.  Pictures of lettuce wraps, vegetable dumplings, spring
        rolls, and salmon sushi. Finally, a great Asian/Sushi place in the
        Mantua - East Greenwich area.  It is a BYOB and you can walk from the
        Death of the Fox brewery in the same plaza before or after dinner.  They
        also do takeout if you want to eat in the brewery.  Highly recommend!
