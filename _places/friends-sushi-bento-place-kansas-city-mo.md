        Not my favorite sushi place. It's honestly hard to pinpoint what was
        wrong. I was rather bummed when the crab in my roll was surimi, but I
        don't remember reading that in the description. I just remembered
        thinking the price of the roll seemed in line with what a real crab meat
        roll would be. The mango on the roll in the picture was crazy thick. The
        filling was not that great either. The texture and taste were almost
        off-putting. The rice of all the rolls seemed severely under seasoned.
        It tasted like it was taken straight from the cooker.

        The fried rice and skewers were fine, but still didn't really impress.

        Taking three kids to a sushi place is expensive and they love sushi. But
        as you can tell in the photos. We didn't finish the food.

        don't remember reading that in the description. I just remembered
        thinking the price of the roll seemed in line with what a real crab meat
        roll would be. The mango on the roll in the picture was crazy thick. The
        filling was not that great either. The texture and taste were almost
        off-putting. The rice of all the rolls seemed severely under seasoned.
        It tasted like it was taken straight from the cooker.

        The fried rice and skewers were fine, but still didn't really impress.

        Taking three kids to a sushi place is expensive and they love sushi. But
        as you can tell in the photos. We didn't finish the food.

        Nice sushi spot on 39th street. Had the tempura shrimp roll which was
        very good.  Also ordered Ekko’s noodle soup and it was huge, fresh
        vegetables and noodles and tofu.  Not as much flavor in the broth as I’d
        wish, but good. Tried the Fukimaki roll and it was good.  Don’t care for
        the tempura shrimp

        and veggies.  The coating was not light and crispy but more of a
        breading.  The service was attentive and the place has a cool vibe. 
        Will be back for the rolls, good quality and price.

        This is a small venue with huge taste. We decided to stop in here from
        the smell in the street. I was literally walking to another location for
        something else and decided to stop in here. We were promptly seated and
        our server gave great suggestions. There were several varieties of Sake
        I wish I tried. The only issue with this spot is the location, because
        parking can be an issue. You may have to park a block away. But if your
        patient the food is worth it! I had the best onion soup ever!

        Friends sushi was my very first experience trying sushi and I'm so glad
        I did because I love it!


        This is also the place I had my first date with my boyfriend of 7 years.
        We come here every year and have dinner just like the day we met!


        We like fried sushi most of the time because it's just sooo good and
        it's very first time sushi friendly. We ALWAYS get the rock n roll but i
        was adventurous this time and ordered something with jalapeños which I
        cannot tolerate! But I wanted the Depth charge and I was so surprised I
        barely could detect the spice!! I'd order that one again for sure. We
        went the other day and got the oyshii roll it was just as good!! The
        short ribs were a bit chewy, but the Flavor was amazing 👏🏾


        Lovely atmosphere and we always get a cute presentation of sushi!

        We really like this restaurant. The food is very good. We've had the
        Rock n Roll, Depth Charge, TNT and the fried rice. All are excellent
        choices! The service is absolutely fantastic. The staff is very
        friendly. Give it a go, you will not be sorry.
