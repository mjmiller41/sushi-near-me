        We’ve dined here a few times and we are always pleased. The restaurant
        itself is tiny and always crowded. The staff is always friendly and the
        food is always great. Normal prices are fair and their Late Night menu
        rocks.


        This visit, we had an incredibly friendly waitress who took time to
        treat us like friends, rather than customers. We came after 10PM on a
        Friday/Saturday which gave us access to the Late Night menu which has a
        few choice menu items at a discounted price. Just know if you go after
        10PM, university students flood the place and it gets noisy.


        We got the gyoza, shrimp tempura roll, Sundance roll, and spicy salmon
        roll. Each roll was beautifully rolled, packed all the flavors as
        advertised, and were exactly what we were craving that night. Sometimes
        rolls with lemon/limes can use too much citrus but the Sundance was
        perfect. The salmon for this visit was probably the best quality we’ve
        ever had from this specific restaurant, so maybe they’ve upgraded their
        fish? Hopefully!


        Overall, this place is consistent and will continue to be a quick and
        easy place for us to come get sushi, especially when we get those late
        night cravings on the weekend :)

        I am so sad to write this because usually I’m happy with my experience
        here. I went Saturday night at 9:45. We waited for 5 minutes and were
        sat quickly. We then waited for 45 minutes before any acknowledgment was
        given to us. No waters, no server came by. Finally someone did and got
        us waters and said our server would be there soon.

        During this 45 minutes, 3 other tables were sat and given waters and
        appetizers right away. Our server finally came about 15 minutes later
        and we ordered. We waited another 30 minutes with no appetizers or food.
        I looked over, saw our plate of sushi be set down, our server came out
        of the kitchen eating food and proceeded to walk around the restaurant
        not giving us our food. About 10 minutes later she brought our rolls, no
        appetizers still. One of the rolls was horribly made and falling apart
        (wasn’t even a roll we ordered). I had to flag down our server again and
        ask for our appetizers and for our correct roll.

        We started eating and all our rolls were warm. The salmon was spoiled
        and left a disgusting taste in your mouth. The tempura was undercooked
        and raw and one of the rolls was missing ingredients in it. We all
        stopped eating and called our server explaining we were done and would
        not be eating anymore.

        She proceeded to tell us that we already started eating and should
        continue. I told her we were done and wanted to leave and if we could
        have something comped because of waiting over an hour and then the food
        being inedible. Keep in mind we only ate 7 pieces total, out of 6 rolls.
        She brought us the check with $5 taken off and the wrong rolls on our
        check. I then asked for a manager 5 times and finally my sister spoke up
        and also asked for a manager.

        He came over, harassed us some more saying it was all fresh, cut today,
        we had to ask for the tempura to be cooked fully next time, and asked if
        we even liked sushi…I was absolutely shocked with this behavior towards
        us and all we wanted to do was leave. After 20 minutes we were finally
        given a check with a slight comp on some rolls and then we left.

        As I was walking out the server came to have me sign. I wasn’t even
        halfway through the signature before she slapped the book shut on me and
        walked away.

        Will not be coming back after being shown such horrible treatment and
        being served warm sushi.

        We have a phenomenal experience every single time! We usually order to
        go. Whether we dine in or take it with us, we enjoy every single visit!
        Everyone is so nice and helpful. The food comes out quick and delicious!
        And the prices are reasonable. Especially their Friday and Saturday
        night deals. 4 rolls and a 35% tip for $50. Pretty nice! Syd is our
        favorite! She's down to earth and loves to take care of everyone who
        comes through the door.

        Wonderful food! The wait staff were amazing and the food was so good.
        It's definitely in the medium price range for food, which makes sense,
        as the food is the best I've had. I definitely want to come after 10pm
        and try their late night menu. Asahi is definitely going to be a go-to
        date spit for my husband and me!
