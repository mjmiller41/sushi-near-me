        We recently dined at Yomama Sushi in Camarillo and were disappointed
        with our experience. While our server was excellent—prompt, friendly,
        and professional—the rest of the visit fell short.


        A 20% gratuity was automatically added to our bill for our party of six,
        but this was not disclosed to us or listed on the menu or any signage.
        It wend unnoticed until after they charged our card, resulting in an
        unintended 40% tip. Additionally, a special roll we ordered was
        incorrect due to a discrepancy between the menu and sushi list. When we
        pointed this out, the management was unhelpful and dismissive, making
        the situation uncomfortable.


        Overall, the sushi was average, and the service beyond our server’s
        efforts was lacking. We won’t be returning and wouldn’t recommend it
        over other local options.

        First and last time we visit.  The female owner is very rude.  They
        don't accurately post their charges and then try to charge more, which
        is false advertising.  After arguing she took our order and failed to
        put my husband's order in.  After waiting for 40 min and watching
        everyone who arrived after us get their food we asked if my husband's
        food was being held because she was mad.  After arguing with her
        husband, the chef, the wife came and asked who took our order,  which
        she knew she did.  She said that my husband never ordered and there was
        no order put on for him. We left.

        Coworker and I came here for our lunch break. Indoor and outdoor seating
        available. Clean and prompt friendly service!

        I ordered the omega roll and the why not roll: Delicious!! Plus, got an
        order of the streamed gyoza: Amazing!! My coworker ordered the lunch box
        and it was nicely plated with large serving sizes. Everything was so
        good. My feet were just tapping away so happy from the food we  were
        eating. Plus, we were in and out in time for our 45 min lunch break. My
        new favorite sushi spot!!!

        I had the chicken teriyaki lunch special for around $14. It included
        miso soup, a small of amount of rather lackless teriyaki chicken,
        iceberg lettuce salad with dressing, sticky rice and tempura vegetables
        some of which I don’t usually see in tempura like green pepper and
        onion.
