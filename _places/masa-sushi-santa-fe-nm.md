        We were definitely pleased with our dinner. The sushi was great and the
        server, Sophia, was the sweetest.

        We definitely will go back there when we visit again.

        We had

        •wontons (cream cheese filled- 1st pic)

        •shrimp tempura roll (2nd pic)

        •tiger roll (not pictured because it was so good we ate it too fast)

        •spicy tuna roll (last pic on left)

        •mars roll (last pic on right)


        We are a little picky about sushi, so we were happy to find some where
        that we feel is as fresh as possible being so far from water.

        The price of the rolls is definitely worth the money. They do not skimp
        on the fish!


        We can’t wait to go back!

        Delicious little hole-in-the-wall. Miso is some of the best I've ever
        had. Softshell crab was also some of the best ever and I love eating
        sushi so this place is legit. Ordered: avocado roll, sweet potato roll,
        ojo caliente roll, spider roll, California, Calamari roll, miso, soft
        shell crab, and seaweed salad. Service was super fast and attentive with
        water refills but not hover-y.

        Not bad. I really like sushi and sashimi. I thought the quality wasn’t
        great, but I do understand how hard it must be to get quality fresh fish
        in a landlocked place.


        The service was awesome. The rolls were tasty — but probably next time
        I’ll order only the vegetarian ones. And the appetizers, which were also
        tasty.

        Took my grandkids here for a late lunch. The food and service were very
        good it is like a cafeteria type setting but quaint, good Japanese music
        as well. I had a very good pan beef with rice noodles,  delicious.
        Everyone else had the rolls, avocado,  California, veggie catapiller,
        tuna, happy, and the shrimp roll, with a side of meatless Japanese fried
        rice. They didn't have any mango mochi, but the strawberry one was good.
        It was a bit short on the edamame, but it was good. I did like their
        iced green tea, very tasty. The place is clean and the staff is very
        attentive. Plenty of parking.
