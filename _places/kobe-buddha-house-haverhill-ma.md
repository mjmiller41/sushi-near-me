        Love it here and the food is always delicious. I highly recommend the
        teriyaki dinner with steak, it's always hot and sizzling. Also the bao
        buns and beef negimaki as appetizers are always my to go picks.

        We have been here many times and tend to order the same things because
        we like them.  We like the Hibachi teriyaki bento 🍱 boxes because you
        get a nice variety of food and flavors.  They come with soup, salad,
        hibachi fried rice, 2 tempura (panko) shrimp and usually 3 different
        tempura veges, plus two pork gyoza and your choice of protein over fried
        sweet onion.  I always have leftovers.    Tonight we both ordered the
        ribeye.  The hub’s was nice, mine was super tough and overcooked. 
        Normally I wouldn’t say anything, but tonight I did for some reason and
        the waitress was lovely about it.  The brought me a new serving of the
        meat and it was much more tender and cooked nicely.  I was thankful.  
        We always sit on the dining room side, but over in the hibachi side of
        the restaurant in Kobe Buddha House at 89 Plaistow Rd, in Haverhill, let
        me tell you, it sounds like fun!  There is always a crowd over there
        cheering on a chef or laughing about something.  Maybe someday we’ll try
        it.  We always see a bunch of people getting takeout.  Parking can
        sometimes be a little tight, but other than that, it’s a great place to
        go.  We tried the bao buns tonight.  They were just OK.  Not a fave. 
        But the miso was awesome tonight.  Lots of seaweed and really tasty.

        I've been to Kobe Buddha House a few times, and while the hibachi
        experience is traditionally good, the seated dining portion leaves much
        to be desired. Unfortunately, the hosts don't have the friendliest
        demeanor when greeting guests, but that's just the beginning.


        The quality of food in the seated area is subpar. My first visit was
        disappointing, but I decided to give it another chance. Sadly, the
        second visit was no better. I even had to send back a beer from the
        draft because it was clearly from an old batch.


        It's extremely disappointing, especially since the hibachi section,
        where the food is made fresh in front of you, is consistently good. The
        seated dining area, however, is a different story, and it's no surprise
        it's usually empty. I hope this review serves as constructive criticism
        and encourages improvements for future customers. As for me, I don't
        think I'll be returning.

        Great food but...we didn't have silverware on the table.  When asked for
        forks and knives the waitress brought out 3 forks one knife for 4
        people.  I was never given any water.  When asked for another fork and 3
        more knives, she came back with a plastic fork and told us they were out
        of silverware.   Huh?  What kind of restaurant runs out of silverware? 
        Lol. So for my husband having to eat steak with a fork, service was a
        bust!

        Food was ok. Service was sub par. (Server,not chef, chef was great!)
        Asked for a drink, came out watered down, asked him about it and he
        argued with me. It was a longisland iced tea with no lemon sour mix and
        very little alcohol. . It tasted awful.  Even the Mai tail was terrible.
        Server was too interested in looking at his phone and yapping it up at
        the bar with the bartender to be concerned with us even though we were
        his only customers. $165.30 for 2 adults and 1 child is ridiculous.
        Sorry, will not be returning.
