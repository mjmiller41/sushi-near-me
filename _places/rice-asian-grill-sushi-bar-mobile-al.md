        I always enjoy a visit to Rice, especially at lunch time. The servers
        are always pleasant, and I’ve never been disappointed in the quality or
        quantity of the food.

        I was with a friend this time who has very strong food allergies. She
        told the server exactly what she wanted, which was completely off the
        menu, and that’s exactly what she received. That is very helpful when
        you’re limited in what you can eat to stay healthy.

        I like their lunch combo. This time I had a small ginger salad, egg drop
        soup, and the ginger stirfry (pictured here). All the dishes were very
        tasty and moderately priced.


        Yes! I will dine in here again.

        menu, and that’s exactly what she received. That is very helpful when
        you’re limited in what you can eat to stay healthy.

        I like their lunch combo. This time I had a small ginger salad, egg drop
        soup, and the ginger stirfry (pictured here). All the dishes were very
        tasty and moderately priced.


        Yes! I will dine in here again.

        The vegetable roll and rice was the best part. I didn’t like the meat or
        spice or chicken wontons. The water and soup tasted of chlorine and bad
        spice. The bathrooms and restaurant were clean and quiet. No military
        discount.

        This was our first time trying Rice. We’ve been interested in the menu,
        but haven’t had the chance to make a visit, but tonight was Valentine’s
        and we were looking for a low key spot with an open table and decided to
        give it a try since it’s off the beaten path.


        We were pleasantly surprised by the warm ambiance and low, intimate
        lighting upon entry. They were pretty busy, which I took as a good sign,
        but we were seated immediately and our server was super friendly from
        the start. She made nice conversation and was very attentive throughout
        the evening.


        We tried the Bulldog roll, the Spicy salmon roll, seaweed salad, tuna
        nigiri, and I had the Thai BBQ chicken entree. Everything was absolutely
        fantastic! The rolls were balanced with great flavor profiles and we
        felt the fish and seaweed salad were some of the freshest quality we’ve
        gotten anywhere lately. However, I REALLY have to praise the chicken. I
        used to patron a very popular Thai restaurant in Birmingham that served
        its own rendition of Thai BBQ chicken, and it was amongst my most
        favorite dishes from anywhere. It’s been well over a decade since I’ve
        been there and I’ve never seen it served anywhere else. I must tell you,
        the Thai BBQ chicken from Rice was just as good and brought back so many
        fond memories of the place I used to go in Bham. The light sweet and
        savory sauce was just as I have always remembered and the chicken was so
        tender, succulent, and just fall off the bone. I honestly don’t know how
        they manage to compose a dish so well with such a fast turn around, but
        it was truly a delight.


        Lastly, I have to comment on the prices. I was shocked at how affordable
        everything was. My entree alone would’ve fetched twice as much downtown
        and my soco cocktail was only $6, which is unheard for any alcoholic
        beverage from many other places. We each had a drink, 2 sushi rolls,
        additional sides and a large entree and still came out around $80
        including tip. Honestly, we can’t wait to go back. I highly recommend!

        Amazing Thai food in AL! The crab rangoons were crispy and filled with
        filling, and the satay sticks were so juicy and tender! They didn’t need
        any sauce, but the peanut sauce paired with it was next level! The fried
        rice tasted like hibachi, and the serving sizes were really good. The
        coconut sauce on the mango sticky rice was nutty and creamy, pairing
        perfectly with the fresh juicy mango!

        I have been to Rice before but it had been awhile since my last visit. I
        can’t remember what I had the last time but it was reason enough to come
        back. Although I had no idea what I wanted I knew I could choose
        something that I could almost guarantee I’d like.

        The char-grilled pork platter sounded good. I had some chicken earlier
        in the day and wanted something different. I ordered online and went to
        go pick up my food,

        It was ready when I got there. I got my food and proceeded to drive
        home. When I got home I was very hungry. I opened the plastic bag and
        got my boxes of food out. Normally when getting take out the plastic bag
        is tied way too tight. This plastic bag was easy to get open. Now that
        may not be important for your eating experience it is for me for some
        reason.

        Anyway, there was a box for the rice and then the main course. I dumped
        the rice into the char-grilled pork platter. There were 2 sauces that
        came with the meal. I didn’t have a clue what to use them for so I put
        the chili sauce on the pork and vegetables and rice. There was also a
        rice vinegar type sauce that I put on the fried shrimp and fried egg.
        Next time I need to look at the menu more closely so I can use the
        sauces properly.

        The food was really delicious. The pork was flavorful. I loved the
        shrimp and fried egg too. I’ll say the vegetables didn’t have much
        seasoning but adding the chili sauce helped.
