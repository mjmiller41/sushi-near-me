        We were seated right away. The chef was cooking for seven people. The
        rice portions are HUGE. My noodle portion was much smaller than the rice
        and it cost a good bit extra. The food tasted really good!! I loved the
        scallops and shrimp. The veggies are great and I LOVE the ginger
        dressing on the salad. Our chef didn’t do many tricks, didn’t toss
        shrimp in our mouth, wasn’t talkative. I wish he has more personality/
        did more of the “fun” things you typically see when eating hibachi. We
        were seated towards the end of the seven people and I did notice I got
        less scallops and chicken than the others. I wish at least for the
        scallops, since you’re paying more, that you got a certain number. It
        was overall a good experience and the food was super tasty! I will
        definetly come back. The only other negative is that the chef was messy
        (see photo) and food was flung everywhere. I really didn’t like eating
        in such a messy environment.

        Took a while for someone to greet us after we were seated. My initial
        order came out incorrect. The California rolls were bland, I don’t
        recommend at all. The hibachi chicken seemed extremely salty. The
        hibachi shrimp however was better. There was a hair in my plate, they
        addressed the issue and made me a new plate which was good.

        I would give it 6 starts if I could. Best Japanese steakhouse we have
        been to. Portions? I literally needed 2 boxes for my leftovers. Food was
        amazing! Chef was friendly and did tricks for the kids which they loved.
        Parking was a pain but just park at the Dunkin across the street.

        DO NOT GO HERE!! We would give this place zero stars if possible. Not
        sure how they have such high ratings but compared to other hibachi
        places in and around the Nashville area this place was down right
        horrible.

        The food was bad as the inexperienced chefs over cooked pretty much
        everything. As far as entertainment by the chef the best they could do
        was very  loud beat boxing on the grill with their utensils. Spilling
        sauce all over the table and not cleaning it up. The service was very
        slow and no one to clear your empty dishes during the meal. Everything
        just left to pile up.

        Segregated seating, like you gotta put only people that look a like
        together.

        JUST GROSS STAY AWAY!!
