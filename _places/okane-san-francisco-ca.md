        Okane offers a nice change of pace from its Michelin-starred sibling,
        Omakase. Located right next door, Okane provides a more relaxed vibe for
        enjoying Japanese comfort food. Think shareable plates, creative rolls,
        and other Asian specialties.


        The restaurant itself is intimate, with limited indoor seating,
        including bar stools. It creates a cozy atmosphere, perfect for a casual
        date night or catching up with friends.  Reservations are recommended,
        especially on weekends, to avoid a wait.


        Our server, Yui, was fantastic. He was attentive and friendly, even
        taking the time to chat with us about the menu and the nigiri as he was
        preparing them.


        We opted for the nigiri combo, hamachi carpaccio, uni nigiri, and
        Wakadori Karaage (crispy chicken). The hamachi carpaccio was a bit
        underwhelming – the slices were thinner than we expected. We also had to
        request ginger (after our first few dishes), which seemed like an
        oversight.


        The star of the show, however, was definitely the nigiri combo. Our 10
        pc. nigiri combo included -


        1. Hirame

        2. Shima aji

        3. Hamachi

        4. Salomon belly

        5. Kurodai

        6. Ikura

        7. Maguro

        8. Hokkaido scallop

        9. Japanese baracuda

        10. Toro with caviar


        Each piece featured generous cuts of fresh fish. My personal favorites
        were the kurodai, salmon belly, Japanese barracuda, and the
        splurge-worthy toro with caviar. These were melt-in-your-mouth
        delicious!


        On the other hand, the uni nigiri was a bit of a letdown. At only $18
        for two pieces, it felt like a steal, but unfortunately, the uni itself
        wasn't as sweet as we'd hoped and had a bit of a fishy aftertaste.


        The Wakadori Karaage was decent but a bit dry and could have used more
        sauce for the amount of chicken.


        Okane is a decent choice for a casual Japanese dining experience. The
        fresh fish in the nigiri combo was excellent, especially some of the
        premium cuts. The service was friendly and attentive. However, a few
        minor stumbles with the hamachi carpaccio, uni, and karaage kept it from
        being a perfect experience.


        If you're looking for a more relaxed take on Japanese cuisine with a
        focus on fresh fish, Okane is worth a try. Just keep in mind the limited
        seating and make a reservation!

        Okane offers a nice change of pace from its Michelin-starred sibling,
        Omakase. Located right next door, Okane provides a more relaxed vibe for
        enjoying Japanese comfort food. Think shareable plates, creative rolls,
        and other Asian specialties.


        The restaurant itself is intimate, with limited indoor seating,
        including bar stools. It creates a cozy atmosphere, perfect for a casual
        date night or catching up with friends.  Reservations are recommended,
        especially on weekends, to avoid a wait.


        Our server, Yui, was fantastic. He was attentive and friendly, even
        taking the time to chat with us about the menu and the nigiri as he was
        preparing them.


        We opted for the nigiri combo, hamachi carpaccio, uni nigiri, and
        Wakadori Karaage (crispy chicken). The hamachi carpaccio was a bit
        underwhelming – the slices were thinner than we expected. We also had to

        Today we have okane. Just getting out I still don’t know how to say the
        name correctly. Anyways I went in pretty blind. I had No idea where I
        was eating or where I was. Not super familiar with soma. The atmosphere
        reminded me of Japan. It had that sort of vibe, though just looking out
        the window reminded me that I was not in Japan. I went to Japan once, it
        was amazing. So the service was great. Welcoming and met all our needs
        even without asking. The fish was fresh and flavorful. The rolls I got
        mixed the flavor of fish and other ingredients very well. I was
        satisfied very much with the quality of the rolls and fish. The fish was
        fatty and fresh. I also got miso soup which came in a big portion. It
        was warm and prepared me for the meal very well. Overall the quality of
        fish and blend of flavors makes the food shine and beat out a lot of
        seafood and sushi places in general. The only thing was the table was
        super sticky. I don’t know why. It was not a big problem, but I prefer
        my tables not to be sticky. Not sure when the next review will be so,
        till next time I guess

        Continues to live up to the hype by serving great sushi and izakaya
        dishes! This time my standout dish was the mentaiko udon, which was the
        best example of udon I've ever had and will always remember from now on
        as what udon texture should be! I also wasn't a big fan of udon before -
        preferring soba when I get the chance - but this changes my perspective.
        I'm going to try more udon from now on


        Update: 3/25 - Amazing as always. Sukiyaki is also delicious and also a
        must try!

        You gotta bookmark this Michelin Bib Gourmand spot!  Okane is a more
        laid-back, authentic Izakaya compared to its sibling restaurant
        @omakase_sf (Michelin starred fine dining). You can choose to dine at a
        table or sit at the chef's bar, where you can watch them prepare each
        dish. The fish here is FRESH and sourced from Toyosu Fish Market in
        Tokyo! There is a lot of selection on the menu ranging from
        sushi/sashimi, yakitori, and hot entrees. No need to break your bank,
        get the quality of fine dining but with the comfort of casual here.


        * Shishito Peppers

        * Hamachi Kama

        * Omakase - Chef's Choice Sashimi (10 pc)

        * Kakuni

        * Shinjuku Roll

        * Wakame Salad

        * Miso Soup

        * Soy Garlic Edamame

        * Born Gold Daiginjo
