        Whenever a new hibachi restaurant opens up in town, it creates quite a
        stir. For years we only had our choice of Tokyo Hibachi & Bar or Mikura
        to get the full hibachi experience (shrimp flyin', sakÃ© chuggin', onion
        ring volcano shootin' fire into the air, which can be felt on the faces
        of people sitting across the room).


        But when Masa arrived, it changed the whole town's dynamic. MIkura was
        basically banished into the nether realm. Their hibachi tables are way
        too cramped. If your two favorite things are the wise-cracking,
        egg-balancing-on-the-spatula, cheery on the outside but everyone knows
        is depressed on the inside hibachi chef and claustrophobia, then this
        place is for you.


        Tokyo has been the king for the longest time, but Masa is a true
        powerhouse in its own right. It's fairly obvious the scales are tipping
        in Masa's favor these days, for if you were to ask an acquaintance about
        where they'd like to go for your pre-arranged sushi lunch that you had
        planned for weeks and miraculously neither of you bailed, nearly every
        time that person would say Masa.


        Speaking of lunch, the specials here are what keep me coming back. Three
        rolls for $13, hibachi combos (i.e. chicken, veggies, fried rice, soup)
        also for $13, and their Lunch Wok & Grill Platters (protein, Cali roll,
        dumpling, rice, and soup) for $12. Bonkers. There are still good deals
        out there, just gotta know where to look.


        The hibachi experience is top notch. Here you get a proper amount of
        space, heck, you might even go as far to say an abundance. And that's
        how it should be. Lots of room, not cramped up next to the other tables,
        where you get splattered from their oil and feel the burn from their
        onion volcanos.


        Must say, I quite dig this place. For the life of me I can't think of a
        single thing I dislike. Bravo, Masa, you are now the king of hibachi in
        Reading, PA.

        Whenever a new hibachi restaurant opens up in town, it creates quite a
        stir. For years we only had our choice of Tokyo Hibachi & Bar or Mikura
        to get the full hibachi experience (shrimp flyin', sakÃ© chuggin', onion
        ring volcano shootin' fire into the air, which can be felt on the faces
        of people sitting across the room).


        But when Masa arrived, it changed the whole town's dynamic. MIkura was
        basically banished into the nether realm. Their hibachi tables are way
        too cramped. If your two favorite things are the wise-cracking,
        egg-balancing-on-the-spatula, cheery on the outside but everyone knows
        is depressed on the inside hibachi chef and claustrophobia, then this
        place is for you.

        We were met with a friendly greeting. We were seated quickly for a
        Saturday night. Food was good. We sat at a table,  but ate a Hibachi
        meal and sushi for this visit.

        Our waitress did ask about any allergies as there can be cross
        contamination if you order the hibachi.

        The go to spot for sushi in this area. The restaurant is clean and
        modern. I always order their hibachi and their sushi is very fresh as
        well. Keep in mind, itâs a pretty noisy restaurant, especially when the
        hibachi chefs are cooking for big groups. Food always comes out in a
        timely manner. Service is friendly too.

        I truly look at this place as the best in town!!! I love the full bar.
        The hibachi is always on point ! But I do prefer to order mine away from
        the grill! I feel like I get a full portion and comes out all
        together!!!

        Iâve developed a gluten sensitivity over the past year and itâs been
        very difficult finding places/food that I can actually enjoy. I went
        here last night and was seated fairly quickly despite it being busy. A
        lot of their rolls are inherently not gluten free, such as tempura, or
        certain sauces being on them. While thereâs a massive menu, itâs really
        upsetting looking at all sorts of delicious foods that Iâd love, but
        canât eat anymore. So I went with the safe option of just tuna cucumber
        and Philadelphia rolls. I was told that the only thing I could have on
        the menu was certain steak hibachi, and that theyâd have to prepare it
        specially. I was told that NONE of the sushi is gluten free. Ended up
        just leaving because I wasnât going to pay 30 dollars for just some
        meat. Very upsetting and frustrating that something that is inherently
        gluten free and something that has SO many options on their menu doesnât
        have a single gluten free option. Even if it was, they donât have gluten
        free soy sauce which is also offered at the majority of sushi
        restaurants. I will not be coming back here even though it has been one
        of my favorite places to eat, and I absolutely would not recommend
        coming here if you have a gluten sensitivity unless you would like to be
        very disappointed.
