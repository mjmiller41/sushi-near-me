        My friend got shrimp on my plate even though she made it clear she’s
        vegetarian. Other than that the food was good. The service was a little
        slow to place our order.

        I recently had the pleasure of dining at Mikado Sushi, and I must say
        that my experience was delightful. Located next to the Santa Maria mall
        downtown , this restaurant offers a welcoming atmosphere with friendly
        staff and a diverse menu of Japanese cuisine.


        To start off my meal, I ordered three California Tempura Rolls, one TNT
        Roll, and one Spicy Crunch Roll. The California Tempura Rolls were a
        delightful twist on the classic California roll, as they were lightly
        battered and fried to perfection. The crunchy exterior added a
        satisfying texture to the creamy filling, and the combination was a true
        delight for my taste buds.


        The TNT Roll was a standout dish, packed with a burst of flavors. The
        blend of spicy tuna, avocado, and cucumber provided a perfect balance of
        heat and freshness. Each bite was a mouthwatering experience that left
        me craving for more.


        The Spicy Crunch Roll was another winner on the menu. It had a fantastic
        kick of spiciness that perfectly complemented the crunchy texture. The
        combination of spicy mayo and the crispy topping provided a delightful
        contrast that added depth to the overall flavor.


        My dad opted for the Yakisoba Noodles, and I must say, they were a
        fantastic choice. The noodles were cooked to perfection, and the
        stir-fried vegetables added a burst of color and freshness. The flavors
        were well-balanced, and the portion size was generous. It was evident
        that great care had been taken to create a dish that pleased both the
        eyes and the palate.


        One aspect that stood out to me was the reasonable prices at Mikado
        Sushi. The quality of the food far exceeded my expectations given the
        affordability. It was refreshing to find a restaurant that offered such
        a high standard of cuisine without breaking the bank.


        Overall, I would highly recommend Mikado Sushi to anyone looking for a
        satisfying Japanese dining experience. The delicious and well-prepared
        food, combined with friendly service, makes it a fantastic choice for
        both casual meals and special occasions. Whether you're a sushi lover or
        prefer other Japanese dishes, Mikado Sushi is sure to leave you
        satisfied. I can't wait to visit again and try more of their delectable
        offerings.

        Was seated in a timely manner. Ordered, and received soup immediately,
        but no drinks. After about 45 minutes with no drink and everyone
        ignoring us we got up to leave. We went to pay for the soups and they
        tried to charge us for the drinks. WE NEVER GOT ANY DRINKS! Our waitress
        was very busy on her phone. I wish she had just said up front "hey I
        don't plan on helping you, or even putting your order in." Then we could
        have saved the hour plus we wasted. Worst $10s worth of soup I ever had.
        Will not be going back there and I hope this review saves some other
        people the trouble of going there. I wouldn't be as mad if I didn't
        suspect that we are ignored for the way we look. I didn't see anything
        resembling a manager. Some one desperately needs to be in charge of that
        place.
