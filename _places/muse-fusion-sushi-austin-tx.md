        Cute spot in south Austin ✨ it was our first time!

        Ordered potstickers for our appetizer. One Thai tea, one ube drink 🥤


        The rolls were tasty. The OMG roll was a bit over the top for me but
        still delicious. My absolute favorite was the Snow White roll with cream
        cheese added! 🍥

        that’s worth returning for takeout 🥡

        The bowl of rice on the side was definitely tasty and brought some
        balance to the flavors in the OMG.

        Total bill with drinks was $78 😮

        Drinks alone we paid $19.

        Maybe try their specials on Tuesday to start (:

        I’ve come here time to time since they opened, and they have gotten
        better and better over time. The food is always consistent fresh, and
        delicious. The staff is very nice, especially the Asian man who is very
        smiley and friendly at the counter. The drinks are yummy, I really enjoy
        the cucumber mint drink, and the strawberry limeade. They have a Tuna
        sando and it is pretty tasty and the portions match the price. I always
        enjoy my meals here. Also glad to have a quick not over crowded sushi
        place close to home.

        I went by Muse with a couple friends tonight and had a great time. The
        girl at the counter Alex was the perfect mix of friendly and
        professional; she was fun and set a happy tone for the night. Seating
        was open with plenty of space for our group, and our drinks and
        appetizers came out quickly. The food was fantastic and the atmosphere
        was great. There was some music, but it wasn’t  loud so my friends and I
        could have easily have a conversation.


        I’d absolutely recommend it as a great spot for a night out with your
        friends or significant other.

        Rating: 3.6/5 [delivery]


        The food took about an hour to arrive, and unfortunately, the sushi
        rolls were underwhelming—basic in flavor and small for the price. The
        search for great sushi in Austin continues.


        C9 Dragon Roll ($17): Nori with protein, kanikama mix, cucumbers,
        masago, scallions, and sesame seeds. They offer more protein choices on
        Postmates, so my husband chose BBQ eel. This had a more cohesive flavor
        than the Happy Roll, but still nothing special.


        M10 Happy Roll ($19.50): Nori with BBQ eel, cucumbers, kanikama, fresh
        salmon, lemon, crunchy topping, unagi sauce, sriracha, masago, sesame
        seeds, and scallions. I didn’t realize it had eel until checking the
        menu—mostly tasted the salmon. Wasn’t a fan of the overall flavor.


        A1 Bird Nest ($15.95): Baked avocado stuffed with kanikama mix, spicy
        mayo, snow sauce, and sesame seeds. This was the highlight of the
        meal—delicious and much better than the sushi. Highly recommend!


        Pistachio Berry Sandwich ($9.50): Fried Japanese shokupan milk bread
        filled with pistachio whipped cream, topped with pistachios and
        strawberry jam. This was so good and easily the best part of the meal.
        The crispy bread was amazing! There was a bit too much cream left over,
        but it wasn’t overly sweet.


        They also forgot our tiger milk with honey boba, but we got a refund.


        Would I come back for the sushi? Probably not. But the Bird Nest and
        dessert made the visit worthwhile!
