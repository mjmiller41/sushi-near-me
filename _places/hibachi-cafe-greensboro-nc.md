        The ambience is good. The menu is artistic. I loved the koi (taking a
        guess here) fishes painted on the wall. The staff are courteous and
        welcoming.


        The food was alright. I asked for steak (medium rare) with brown rice
        but received well done. What’s the point of asking how we want our steak
        cooked if in the end you want to disappoint us. Other than that
        everything is good. I also ordered pork gyozas and they were great. But
        maybe I wouldn’t come back here cuz I didn’t find the food too
        appealing. Overall 5/10

        Ordered on 03/19/2024

        I waited a full 45 minutes after being told it would be 25 minutes at
        most. I ordered 3 rolls and Habachi Salmon. The vegetables were less
        then seasoned, Salmon was overcooked, and everything was just not worth
        the wait and was just really disappointing. The staff did not seem to
        care about how long the wait was. Again, not bad just meh. I frankly
        will not be going again. It was my first impression and my last.

        Customer service was great, I placed an order over the phone. The food
        was good the only thing is there is a difference between greasy goodness
        and just greasy. The chicken egg roll was very greasy unfortunately, it
        was even dripping from the egg roll like it did not have time to rest or
        drain from the fryer. Overall the food was good and the sauce for the
        egg roll was tasty.

        Hibachi Café never disappoints. I’ve been ordering here for years, and
        they only get better! Literally everything I’ve ever ordered from here
        is amazing, from the sushi to fried rice. Love it! Oh, and try the new
        steak and cheese egg rolls! They’re amazing! It’s giving pastelitos!!
