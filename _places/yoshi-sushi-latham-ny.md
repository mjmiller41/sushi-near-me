        Sushi restaurant with an old school flare, just the way I love it. The
        sushi rolls were delicious & and fresh, and the octopus sunomomo was on
        another level! Everything was great, and the sushi master was fast &
        efficient. I am coming back to try other things on the menu very soon.

        Every single dish brought in was very fresh, tasty and prepared with
        great care. Rolls were melting in our mouth and the Yoshi Sushi roll is
        very impressive. Highly recommended!

        Very delicious meal that was absolutely super fresh and didn't have any
        hints of fishy taste compared to all the other sushi restaurants I've
        had in the capital region. The selection of fish and its preparation was
        genuinely made with love and care. A husband and wife run this place
        without any other workers, so I'd advise only patient and understanding
        individuals who truly know how to appreciate someone's time and art to
        go here. My cup did have something stuck to it, but nothing a little
        wipe can't take off. Probably just missed it. Regardless of that, the
        overall place is kept very clean, and the food, once again, was
        wonderfully made and fresh. Tummies are satisfied, and I will recommend
        this place to everyone I know.

        Best sushi we have eaten in years, if not ever. Mom and pop shop, and
        every roll is made fresh, so you gotta be patient. (Came in right after
        a giant party of businessmen, and when I tell you we didn’t get our food
        for an hour and the sushi was worth the wait, you catch my drift!) The
        salmon skin with salmon on top absolutely to die for. Yoshi is very
        clearly a master of his craft!

        We were visiting the area and decided we wanted sushi. Yoshi Sushi
        appeared to be owned by a mom and pop. He was chef and she was the
        waitress.  I think they were at-least in their late 60s.  Overall, the
        sushi was well done and reasonably priced. You check the boxes on a
        paper menu with your order and she collects it. Tea is given upon being
        seated. The miso soup was surprisingly fantastic.  The salad was
        standard. The spices used on the sushi pulled everything together. Our
        personal favorite was the a spicy tuna roll.
