        Not sure if Nippon Sushi is a chain, but it has that vibe. Really
        enjoyed our rolls, nonetheless. I recommend the spicy salmon and
        yellowtail with scallion, very fresh and well put together. We’ll be
        back! Oh, and the bathroom was immaculate.

        This is truly a nice above average restaurant as far as decor, food,
        etc.


        Sushi I am not a fan, but a very special friend of mine this was a
        special occasion - so we went. As the stars I rated, the atmosphere is
        good. Service pretty good (not 5 star though), and even though I had no
        opinion on sushi, I graded based on what my friend thought. Food was
        absolutely 5 stars. Everything prepared perfectly. Tasty. And the food
        presentation is way above average.


        Now I will explain how they fell to only a three star rating: PRICES. I
        fully understand about prices have risen in restaurants. I also
        understand sushi restaurants charge more, not just because of fresh fish
        but probably the  pay extended to the amazing chefs that have such
        talent putting these dishes together. The art of it.


        Quite a few other reviews mentioned the prices but I took them lightly
        just figuring from people that don't dine out regularly anymore, and the
        realization this restaurant is in a pretty high income area - but my
        review lost 2 stars; prices were 100% insane. You will love the food,
        bill not so much.


        2 people, I ate light, friend did order more, only ONE drink a piece.
        $130!!! (+ tip). WHEW!

        I love this restaurant. I think that they have the best sushi,
        specifically the signature Alaska Roll. It melts in your mouth! Its like
        a drug! We also love the dumpling appetizers, beef and shrimp. The food
        comes out so quickly. Good, fast service. I will be a frequenter of
        Nippon.

        Food was really good and service was alright.  The spicy garlic edamame
        was really good! My only complaint is typically sushi places will
        provide soup and salad when you get multiple rolls and they do not. I
        did really want salad so I got it and it was good and really big but it
        made the meal even pricier. I would maybe come back after trying some
        other local sushi places.

        My first time there but I was very pleased with my visit. I took my son
        with me and we ordered the calamari for appetizer and many rolls to have
        for lunch. All our orders tasted great and were well prepared. The
        service was very good and the place was clean and brightly lit.
