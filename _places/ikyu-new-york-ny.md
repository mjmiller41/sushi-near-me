        I ordered Kara-Age (fried chicken), a single scallop sushi, and pork
        katsu with rice and miso soup. The environment was warm and cozy. The
        scallop was nice and fresh. It had jelly-like texture and wasn’t fishy
        at all. However, it wasn’t as sweet as I expected. The fried chicken was
        okay. The oil smelled a bit stale. The better had a soft crunch to it.
        The chicken inside was tender and juicy, but the batter was a little too
        thick. The pork katsu was good. It was crispy on the outside and the
        inside was nice and firm. For some reason, it didn’t have the stale
        smell to it like the fried chicken did. The portion was very good. I
        almost couldn’t finish it. The miso soup was average.

        Overall, it was a standard experience. The staff were friendly.

        inside was nice and firm. For some reason, it didn’t have the stale
        smell to it like the fried chicken did. The portion was very good. I
        almost couldn’t finish it. The miso soup was average.

        Overall, it was a standard experience. The staff were friendly.

        Hidden gem! This is a gorgeous (Japanese simplicity) restaurant.
        Everything from the seating areas to the dishes were perfect. Then,
        there's the food... which was incredibly fresh, magnificently prepared,
        and absolutely delicious. Prices were on par for NYC, and it's
        definitely worth a trip to the UES for this nice meal.

        9/10!! Ikyu had amazing staff. My girlfriend accidentally dropped a
        chopstick, and they immediately came to give a new one. Sometimes, it’s
        the little things. The sushi rolls were slightly expensive anywhere from
        $10-20. The plate in front of me is the Salmon Fizz Roll and a Shrimp
        Tempura Roll behind it. The one on the other plate was a Salmon Skin
        roll. All of them were served well. The fish was fresh, the ingredients
        were prepped properly, and overall was a very enjoyable experience. For
        desert, we tried the cream cheese ice cream with honey and peanuts (I
        know sounds weird). The server even made shredded to ask if we were
        allergic to peanuts which some servers don’t do enough honestly. After a
        while it did grow on me, and it felt like the dish only came together
        when you had all three on a spoon. The honey with only the ice cream
        felt misplaced. So I’d give desert a 6.5/10. The ambiance is really
        nice, and definitely makes for a great spot to eat whether you’re on a
        date or by yourself (They have stools in front of the sushi bar).
        Definitely would go again!

        Ordered pickup for the first time, we got the sushi and sashimi platter
        for 2. It was pricey, but delicious.


        The miso soup was probably the best I’ve ever had! It was so flavorful
        and I wish I got more of it. Salmon is my favorite and it met my
        expectations.


        The fish is very fresh, but for the money I spent, I was expecting it to
        blow my mind. It’s definitely a good spot for basic rolls, but if I want
        to spend lots of money on sushi I’ll go elsewhere.

        Great new sushi place in the area. We were able to walk in on Sunday
        night and eat at the sushi bar (there were tables too). Service was
        super fast & staff was very nice. Prices are reasonable but some of the
        portions were small (crispy rice with tuna & the rock shrimp were
        smaller than we expected). Otherwise, food was good! Will definitely
        come back here and try more rolls. Front of the restaurant is a little
        bright for my liking but the back had better lighting & atmosphere.
