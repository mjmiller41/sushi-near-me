        This was our second visit at Leo's Kitchen in Otay Ranch on 6/10/24. We
        were greeted by a friendly waitress right away, the service is always
        nice, and with a clean and pleasant environment. We ordered the calamari
        which was fresh, hot, and crispy the way we like. We also each ordered
        some of their specialty rolls and they were very delicious and
        satisfying, as well as some flavorful Yuki Nigori Mango Sake to wash it
        all down! We love this place, anytime we crave sushi, this is the spot!

        Ordered take out from Leo’s Kitchen and we were grateful the food didn’t
        disappoint. The items we ordered were:


        Hot Cheeto roll: spicy crab, cucumber, avocado, covered in hot Cheeto
        crumbs, spicy mayo, siracha dots - the roll tasted good, but the hot
        cheeto crumb didn’t really add spiciness or enhance the flavor of the
        roll.


        SD Roll: cream cheese, avocado, salmon, tempura fried, topped with
        jalapeño, spicy mayo, siracha dot and eel sauce - we loved the
        creaminess and how each flavor complimented the other.


        Tiger roll: cucumber, avocado, crab, shrimp tempura topped with avocado,
        eel sauce, spicy mayo and sesame seeds - something fried, something
        sweet and something spicy. What more do you need?


        OMG roll: cucumber, avocado, crab, shrimp tempura, topped with spicy
        crab, jalapeño, eel sauce and sesame seeds - simple but still tasty.


        Kids teriyaki bowl - the teriyaki sauce was balanced, the chicken cooked
        well and the veggies fresh.


        We paid roughly $88.60 (with tip). Leo’s Kitchen deserves a return visit
        and next time, we will dine in, especially since staff during pick up
        was helpful and friendly

        Visited on 4/21/25 between 11am and 12pm. The host/server needs more
        customer service skills. Seems like she doesnt want to be there which is
        understandable with any job but make an effort. She has a very "dry"
        personality.That kind of pressence deters people from coming back. The
        ramen is no bueno. Stick to sushi. The noodles were undercooked and
        chewy. I was looking forward to finishing my meal and leaving ASAP. Not
        a place I'd recommend to friends and family. The server needs some
        coaching or look for a different job.

        I LOVE this sushi spot! The moment you take a bite, you can tell they
        only use the freshest ingredients. The flavors are incredible, and you
        can taste the quality.


        Their menu is super diverse, with vegan options that are so good, even
        non-vegans will love them! There's something for everyone here.


        Happy hour is a must-try - their menu is amazing, and the prices are
        unbeatable!


        Personally, I'm hooked on the Chula Vista roll, but honestly, everything
        I've tried has been top-notch. The chefs here are talented, and it shows
        in every dish. They also have by request the boat platter that fits
        different rolls which is really cool!


        If you're a sushi lover like me, or just looking something new, this
        place is a must-visit!


        I Highly recommend Leos Kitchen!

        Went here yesterday for my birthday. Waitress acted as if she didn’t
        even want to be there and acted like it was a chore to serve my older
        boyfriend and I. Did not smile at us once. The only time I saw her smile
        was when she was exchanging judgmental glances with the chefs in front
        of my boyfriend and I. I’ve never felt more unwelcome and judged at a
        restaurant before. The atmosphere was void of life. We had to ask for
        soy sauce which is strange because that’s never happened at any sushi
        restaurant I’ve been to in the past. Spicy Tuna Roll was bitter, but Hot
        Cheeto Roll was good. Edamame was alright, but I’ve had it much better
        at other locations. Not worth it and I will never go back.
