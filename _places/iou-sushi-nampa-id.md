        This is undoubtedly my favorite sushi spot in Idaho, and I can not
        recommend it enough! Bar seating lets you place orders directly with the
        sushi chefs who are very kind and funny! Orders come out quickly and
        always have a lot of care put into the presentation. Make sure you grab
        yourself all-you-can-eat dinner prices for sampling all kinds of
        delicious rolls, including their iconic crystal shrimp!

        Nice walk in place, sat at the bar for all you can eat lunch. 
        Everything was delicious, but I was particularly impressed with the
        mackerel.

        Went out for lunch with my 10 year old and it was so delightful! We
        ordered the rainbow  roll , Alaskan roll, and the crab hand roll (upon
        ordering i was advised of it being sweet), as well as a quail egg
        shooter (recommended), and everything tasted fresh and came out looking
        good! I can't wait to bring the whole family here! Oh also they put
        together kid friendly chopsticks without us asking! So such wonderful
        service and everyone there was so friendly and welcoming as well!

        We arrived right when they opened, we were able to pick our table. We
        were served our drinks pretty quickly. The rolls took a very long time,
        it took between 30-40 minutes to get rolls. Most of the time spent in
        the restaurant was us sitting and waiting.

        The food was really good. We had the all you can eat sushi. If I were to
        go again, I would order all of our rolls at once so we weren’t waiting
        for so long. We also noticed that tables who were seated after us were
        getting their food before us. We ordered at least 20 minutes before the
        other tables, but they were served first
