        Tappi is truly one of the best local restaurants, offering some of the
        most delicious sushi rolls we’ve ever had. Each roll was crafted with
        fresh ingredients, bursting with flavor and beautifully presented. What
        made the experience even more special was the personal touch—the owner
        took the time to stop by our table, warmly greeting us and making us
        feel like valued guests. The service was exceptional, with the staff
        being friendly, and knowledgeable. Tappi is a must-visit spot for anyone
        who appreciates high-quality sushi and a memorable dining experience.

        Nice place. Cozy inside. Bar, sushi bar, tables. Cocktails. Happy hour.
        Looks like it's closed from the outside. Chicken Katsu was delicious. I
        ordered a chicken curry bowl. While tasty, in person the dish wasn't
        what I'd expected and I still would've ordered it with a modification.
        The prices were vastly different than in person or on small to go menus.
        The bowl was online at $10, in reality it was 16.99+tax.  Portion was
        good size. My to go curry didn't come in a bowl container but a regular
        styrpphone  square. And because this is not a chunky curry sauce it was
        a mess in the bag before it even reached my hands. Bc of the diced
        nature of the small diced potatoes and the shredded carrot this is quite
        saucy. Think a thin curry stew. A yummy sauce to be sure. Knowing this I
        would probably ask for a soup container wrapped in plastic for the sauce
        to go. if I ordered this dine in, I might still ask for either lighter
        sauce or on the side. They did attempt to keep sauce to one side of the
        container so half of each katsu slice touched the sauce. I ended up
        eating it in my car rather than have a soggy mess when I drove. Worth it
        taste wise. I'd like to come back and try their sushi and sashimi

        Server was friendly and accomodating. Ordered the chef's special sashimi
        and the salmon was the only thing that tasted and felt good enough. Half
        shell oysters tasted decent. The jalapeno poppers were amazing but too
        spicy for my taste. Strawberry martini was good according to my wife.
        Sin City roll was good and my Padres roll was huge and alright. They
        have a lot of choices in their menu and it took a bit to choose which
        one to order. Atmosphere was nice and the inside of the restaurant looks
        clean. Everything was a nice experience except for majority of the food
        that we ordered.

        Tappi has a great selection. Many many rolls to chose from and all very
        tasty from what I've tried. They also have a full bar. I enjoyed the
        insanity roll and the shrimp poppers. They have plum wine flavored mochi
        which was excellent.
