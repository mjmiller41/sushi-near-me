        Gold Fish Asian Bistro was an okay experience! Nothing horrible, but
        nothing that was really that good or that really excited me. Overall
        it's about a 3.5. Chinese is just hard to find in Utah.


        The prices I will say are very very fair and very cheap for a sit down
        Chinese restaurant. They are really good with their prices. 10.99 for a
        dinner combo with Meat, Dried Rice, Soup, 2 Gyoza, and a spring roll.
        Impressive. The food itself was very mild in flavor, and just a tad
        overcooked. The crisp on the chicken dishes were nice though, great
        breading. General Tsos wasn't very spicy and seasoned, looked better
        than how it tasted. Orange chicken lacking in orange. Rice very basic
        and not very flavorful. A little crumbly on the texture. The noodles
        were very vegetable filled, but they were very nice to give me a little
        side of lo mein for just a couple bucks! Unfortunately the soup didn't
        taste like much and could use some salt.


        Service was pretty good! They were very kind and helpful, nice little
        place to be in as well! Maybe okay for a quick budget Chinese stop!

        Go here. Seriously. Go. Sushi is my favorite food and they did not
        disappoint. Derek (the chef and owner) and his wife took such great care
        of us. I’m so full right now, it hurts to breathe and I have no regrets.
        Super fair prices too. Love mom and pop places!

        Delicious food. One of My favorite brunch experiences so far. The mango
        sushi roll was delightful and the cream cheese wontons were incredible.
        I feel like cream cheese wontons can be overwhelming at times especially
        if the crispy part is thick. These were so light and the cheese was
        melted it was incredible.

        I recently had the pleasure of dining at Goldfish Bistro and I have to
        say, it was an incredible experience. The atmosphere was lovely and the
        sushi was outstanding. I was particularly impressed by the manager,
        Adam, who went above and beyond to ensure that my dining experience was
        exceptional. His attention to detail and knowledge of the menu were
        truly impressive. Adam made some fantastic recommendations, both for
        sushi and drinks, and his exceptional service truly elevated our dining
        experience. I highly recommend Goldfish Bistro to anyone looking for
        delicious sushi and exceptional service!. Thank you, Adam, for making
        our visit such a wonderful one!
