        If yall haven’t been to Soma Sushi, you are severely missing out. Their
        Valentine’s Day special was incredible! $60 for two starters (we did
        oysters and ceviche), a roll and three pieces of nigiri, a cooked main
        (duck for me, steak for my husband), and a desert (we went with kochi
        ice cream. Greated with a rose and sent home with freshly made macrons.
        What more could you ask for!

        I originally came to the area planning to grab sushi at another nearby
        spot, but by chance, I stumbled across this place during a quick Google
        search. The great reviews caught my eye, so I decided to give it a shot.


        From the outside, it's tucked into a pretty rundown-looking strip mall,
        so I wasn’t expecting much—but I was genuinely surprised when I stepped
        inside. The space is massive, beautifully decorated, and has a really
        upscale vibe.


        We started with a few appetizers—specifically the gyoza and edamame,
        both solid choices. For our mains, we ordered the Wagyu bowl, the spider
        roll, and a few different types of sashimi. Everything was fresh and
        full of flavor. The service was excellent too—friendly, attentive, and
        fast.


        For the amount and quality of food we got, I felt the price was fair.
        All in all, it was a lucky find, and I’m definitely coming back to try
        more from their menu. Highly recommend checking this place out if you're
        in the area.


        Oh—and random detail, but the bathroom was super clean and actually
        pretty nice, which I always appreciate.

        Wow, TLDR: Come here, you won’t regret it!


        We came a few weeks ago; literally traveled to Houston from Austin w the
        intention of eating good food, and this place didn’t disappoint! Outside
        looks a bit rough, but my goodness. Don’t let it deter you! Inside is
        modern, sleek and spacious! The girls up front were friendly both over
        the phone and when we arrived. We were seated promptly and our server
        was Michelle. She was super cool, very knowledgeable about the menu,
        gave great recommendations and was really attentive. The food was
        outstanding and came with great timing. The price point is so good, we
        couldn’t help but order a ton 🤤 My husband and I have been raving about
        this place ever since and recommend all of our friends to go. My crappy
        pictures honestly don’t do it justice. We also ordered a lot more, but
        couldn’t wait to eat it 😅 Give it a try!! And order all the things.

        Bummer because the food was very good. Shishito’s not charred & toooo
        salty & ramen not spicy so no need to say spicy; but the rolls, sashimi
        and sake were delicious! The biggest bummer was entering & being seated
        under a spot light at an unclean table. Table next to us was dirty &
        they sat people too. While looking at menu, a food runner dropped an
        appetizer at our table. At least 4-5 minutes later, the server grabs it
        and places it in front of the guests sitting next to us. Server didn’t
        say a word. We headed to host stand to pay and the close out took
        forever. It’s a bummer because date night is rare. Houston has
        exceptional restaurants. Soma’s atmosphere felt like being at Apple
        Bees; but sushi! 🥲

        Soma has been our favorite Sushi restaurant to dine. We went for our
        Anniversary and had an amazing experience. Everything was delicious and
        the staff is amazing! Our favorite waiter is Manny. We will continue to
        dine here every chance we can!
