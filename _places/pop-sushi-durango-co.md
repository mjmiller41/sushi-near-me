        Everything was delicious! Our first time ordering the Steam Buns, and
        they were fantastic. We are eager to return. The restaurant gets really
        busy very quickly, so I’ll advise to get there early and make a
        reservation. Certainly worth it!

        The fish is great. I disagree with the decision to put citrus oil and
        wasabi on the Nigiri. It doesn't need it and lots of people don't want
        the sushi chef to decide on wasabi. We had it loaded on and were trying
        to scrape it and the strongly flavored oil relish off.


        If you are really a sushi lover I recommend the sashimi. They can't load
        it up with overpowering flavors.


        Service is fast and they flip tables quickly. Its not a bad place for a
        casual date but not a fancy dinner atmosphere. Something in between a
        sports bar (TV's playing on the walls) and a nice sit down place.

        A blonde girl. Unbelievable yellowtail and gyoza! Food was fantastic but
        service made the night.

        so very out of the blue. i love food and especially it being asian
        oriented. At durango colorado and never would o imagine that i would say
        that i have had the absolute best spicy miso ramen so far!

        chasu = perfection, all ingredients super flavorful, and i will tell you
        what, if you love mushrooms and understand what it can do, please come
        and eat!

        The shitake mushroom has made the broth and ramen what i believe is what
        it is suppose to taste like. I have not gone to japan, but i can only
        hope it tasted this wonderful to me. The squid salad and miso soup
        shouldve been a dead giveaway of how wonderful this was . And whitney
        topping off the service has been an amazong experience! Itadakimasu!

        What can I say about Pop Sushi that hasn't already been said.

        If you're near Durango and looking for some damn fine sushi, Pop is
        where ya wanna be, especially for Pop Hour (happy hour from 4p-5:30p),
        as they have great specials.

        I had an order of curry goat cheese wontons that were absolutely
        delicious, a Philly roll that was top notch, and THE BEST tuna nigiri
        I've ever had. It's probably the deepest red tuna I've ever seen, and it
        practically melted in my mouth! 🤌🏻

        I also scarfed down an order of the calamari and washed it down with a
        cold Kirin Ichiban.

        The service at the bar was fantastic, and the ambiance of the place is
        relaxed and inviting.

        If you're looking for great sushi, just do yourself a favor and go to
        Pop.

        I really don't see how you could be disappointed.
