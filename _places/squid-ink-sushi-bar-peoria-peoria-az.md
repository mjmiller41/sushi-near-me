        This was our first time at Squid Ink, and there was a great variety to
        choose from on the menu. We went with potstickers and sushi, trying the
        house rolls—Ravenous and Ultimate Philly (with a salmon substitute).
        Both were very good, though we were not a fan of the eel sauce. A bit
        too sweet for our taste, but if you enjoy sweet flavors, you might love
        it! One small thing—we’re used to having a small dish for soy sauce, but
        they provided a dispenser only and you have to pour it over your food or
        on your plate. Overall, the vibe was nice, our waitress was polite, and
        we’d come back again.

        The Miso soup was great and the sushi was good, but I feel like overall
        the food was overpriced. I was bummed that we arrived before 2pm and by
        the time the server took our order it was 2:01pm and she wouldn’t let us
        order their lunch special anymore. We also waited so long for our check
        that we had to go to the front check in desk to pay when we were done.
        If the service was better, I may consider returning.

        This place has a lot of great potential. The only thing that I saw wrong
        with it was that the fish handling wasn't on par with other sushi
        restaurants that I know and love. Fish refrigerator was left open or
        unsealed. Also fish was not being rewrapped after being used. And this
        leads to unfresh sushi. It was very apparent when we received our
        salmon. The tuna was surprisingly fresh though

        I think that a few little changes and improvements of the fish handling
        and sushi line could make this place a weekly stop for me. Sushi Fridge
        doors left open and fish not being rewrapped to stop oxidation leads to
        unfresh fishy tasting fish. The service was par the environment was
        birdie. And I appreciate the experience. Photo attached is of the sushi
        line being left open and fish un sealed.

        Edit to response****

        Thank you for your acknowledgement. As mentioned in my review my
        favorite sushi places don't make those mistakes. It's a small detail
        that improves quality and taste of fish if followed properly.  I didn't
        get ill or sick from the sushi it simply causes a less fresh taste. When
        I go back I will update my review and will gladly give 5 stars with
        improvement. I have increased my rating with your response. Good
        ownership speaks volumes.

        After a spectacularly cruddy day we both decided sushi was the answer. 
        I'd never been here and it was close so that is where we went.  We
        arrived during happy hour so got a few things for a reduced price.  We
        had the Vegas roll, the East Meets West, Surf N Turf and Flying
        Phoenix.  They were all great, with a toss up between East and Phoenix
        as to our favorite choice for the evening.  The service was friendly and
        quick.  We will definitely be back for more!

  outdoor seating that make it a fun place for groups, but a few mention
