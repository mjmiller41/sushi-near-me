        Well let's start with the good part. I went on a Sunday for lunch. 
        Dessert was good and each dish was served hot. Now to the ugh part.
        Every dish didn't look like it had any care when cooked. The taste was
        definitely missing something. My favorite Chinese take out has more love
        given to it. The sushi looked like it sat there for a while.  I tried
        the hibachi where you get your own ingredients expecting you made
        something yummy but my first bite I spit it in my napkin. I didn't
        bother to just go with swallowing it.    Seafood was plentiful but small
        in comparison.  General Tai's and coconut shrimp were overdone and too
        much breading.  Noodles were bland and small.  Soup was basic and again
        lacked flavor.  I wasn't feeling the Chinese food so went with
        American.  What could go wrong right?  Mac and cheese was cold and
        mashed potatoes definitely had the came out of a bag taste. Gravy did as
        well. I'd get new chefs. I'm not sure how this place gets amazing
        reviews.  For me to come all the way to Plainfield I truly expected
        something much better. I won't be back. I'd travel up north or south to
        get something more edible for the money.

        Well let's start with the good part. I went on a Sunday for lunch. 
        Dessert was good and each dish was served hot. Now to the ugh part.
        Every dish didn't look like it had any care when cooked. The taste was
        definitely missing something. My favorite Chinese take out has more love
        given to it. The sushi looked like it sat there for a while.  I tried
        the hibachi where you get your own ingredients expecting you made
        something yummy but my first bite I spit it in my napkin. I didn't
        bother to just go with swallowing it.    Seafood was plentiful but small
        in comparison.  General Tai's and coconut shrimp were overdone and too
        much breading.  Noodles were bland and small.  Soup was basic and again
        lacked flavor.  I wasn't feeling the Chinese food so went with
        American.  What could go wrong right?  Mac and cheese was cold and

        The staff were friendly! The bathrooms were not so appealing. There was
        literal duct tape holding things together in the bathroom. The
        restaurant itself was not bad as far as decorations and environment go.
        There was a nasty smell near the table my family and I were sitting at.
        It smelled like sewage. Not a fun smell, glad it didn't make an
        appearance until we finished eating. The food... none of it was hot.
        None of it had flavor and it was chewy. I didn't finish my plate because
        it just wasn't good and I was a bit fearful of getting sick because the
        hot food was not hot. The buffet line did not have any food labeled and
        there was a long hair stuck to one of the serving tongs in one of the
        food dishes. The cost is kind of expensive for the quality of food
        you're getting. The bill came out to $50 and some change for two adults
        and a child plus the cost of drinks. This totals around $15 and some
        change per adult. The food was not worth this. I came here because it
        was rated 4 stars.. after eating here, I have no idea why! Won't be
        returning.

        ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BUFFET! I always go here when in the area, I live a
        couple hours away and will always choose this restaurant when visiting.
        They have so many different options and it is not too bad of a price.
        The restaurant is always clean and very quiet. You are able to enjoy a
        nice meal here. The bacon chicken is fantastic and would recommend it
        100%. It is also kid-friendly who are picky eaters. They had mac and
        cheese and chicken nuggets when I visited last. You will not regret
        stopping by this location!

        We live close and have tried this place multiple times. Our last visit
        the food was dry and the sushi selection looked like it had set out all
        day. We picked other options and sat down. Our waitress was very pushy
        to take our plates and brought us the bill before we even got through
        our first plate. Saying you can pay now and was very pushy about it.
        Like she wanted us to leave as soon as possible it was very awkward. 
        Then I took my daughter to the bathroom and hoe I wish I would of took a
        picture of the disgusting seen. The bathroom looked like it was flooded
        toilet paper stuck on the floor really nasty.. I wish I would of seen
        the bathroom before we got food we would of never sat down.I would love
        to see the health department report for this restaurant no way they pass
        inspection.

        Sadly this seems like a place that made a lot of cost savings moves and
        survived but never recovered from 2020.

        The sushi was better than expected but the buffet food was bland and
        disappointing.

        The only mustard available was in the packets which sadly is always just
        all bitter with no heat. There were no chopsticks available and eating
        sushi with a fork is just wrong.

        My friend had some mussels and said they were watery. The chicken I had
        was tough.

        I hate to see a place like this in decline which is what I suspect.

        A side note, do not use the soy sauce on the table. Someone had poured
        salt in it and it was very salty. I politely informed the staff and they
        took it to dump, clean and refill.
