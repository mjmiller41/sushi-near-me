        Did the all you can eat menu and was very satisfied. The eel and the
        black pepper seared tuna were the stars. The rice was good, properly
        cooked and clean. Although the pieces and rolls had smaller portions and
        sizes, I thought that was fine as it was easier to eat and allows one to
        try many different things as opposed to ala carte items. I wish they had
        some Katsu style items but all in all pretty impressed. Service was
        patient and you never got the feeling they were rushing you out.

        My husband and I have been here three times in the past two months for
        the all you can eat sushi dinner. There are a wide variety of options to
        choose from on the menu, including appetizers, hibachi items, and sushi.
        Everything is prepared fresh and you can watch the chefs make your
        sushi. We've probably tried almost every sushi item on the menu at this
        point and have loved everything. My favorite is the Rainbow Roll and the
        Crazy Monkey. Sushi Queen has really expanded my sushi palette with
        their traditional and unique choices. I included several pictures of
        some of the plates we ordered. The food is fresh and delicious! The
        service is amazing - efficient and everyone is very kind. This is
        definitely our go to sushi restaurant going forward and I've already
        been telling my friends how amazing it is here! The prices are extremely
        reasonable for the quality of food too!

        Sushi Queen is one of my favorite restaurants! The all-you-can-eat
        option for just $25 per adult is a fantastic deal. The menu is packed
        with so many delicious options—it’s hard to choose! If you can, I highly
        recommend trying everything at least once.


        The crab rangoon is hands-down my favorite—you can never go wrong with
        it. Whether you're craving sushi, appetizers, or classic Japanese
        dishes, Sushi Queen has something for everyone. Definitely a must-visit
        spot for anyone who loves Japanese food!

        Great place for sushi and veg sushi. We normally do pick up, but I
        learned about their all you can eat Monday lunch. It's nice to go with
        the wife for lunch when we have off. All the food was pretty good and I
        can't say I had anything bad. Staff are all very nice people and we will
        definitely go bad for the Monday lunches

        I came here for lunch break not knowing what to expect, but I must say
        that I was shocked by how much I enjoyed the meal. Everything tasted
        great and it was all very fresh; you cannot beat the all you can eat
        lunch for only $16.99. I will definitely be back.
