        A unique place for very reasonably priced sushi.  Loved the conveyor
        belt approached.  Couldn't keep my eyes off of the sushi, and other
        treats, going around and around.  Sure you can find higher quality sushi
        but at prices much higher.   A great place for kiddos. You can also
        order from the menu.

        This is a great place to take my kids. They usually eat very basic
        rolls, so this is a place to go if you don't want to spend much money
        going to another sushi place. We love the nigiri, the baked shrimp roll,
        the creamy salmon roll, the yakisoba, and the fried rice are good too.
        Sashimi is pretty fresh and has a fair price. Fun place for the kids and
        the customer service is always great.

        A lot of our favorite rolls were out, but that’s not any fault of the
        restaurant. When they see that they’re out, they make more. It was just
        busy. Great food, great atmosphere!

        The concept of this restaurant is amazing. A set price for each plate of
        food that passes by you on a conveyer belt system. It takes a few
        minutes for the belt to make a complete pass and you just pick what you
        want. This is amazing because you are not tied down to an entire roll,
        you can get 2 or 3 pieces at a time. The restaurant has been clean and
        the service has been great every time I go. Sake bombers yes!!

        We came in here during lunch time and it was pretty full. The service we
        received was good and consistent. The place was pretty clean, and even
        though it was revolving you still had enough time to read the label on
        the different sushi/foods. It is nice that they have a wide variety of
        different sushi to choose from. Some of them even contain bulgogi.
        Personally I am more into sushi without the crab salad/mix, and higher
        quality fish. If you're into crab salad with almost all your sushi
        rolls, this is probably the place for you. I'm not exaggerating when I
        tell you that out of 30 different sushi rolls/ appetizers, 5 did NOT
        contain crab salad. The nigiri of course is not included. The salmon on
        the Philly roll was smoked and had an extremely small portion. We tried
        several different plates as well as three sake bombs and left paying $77
        which I felt was a fair price. After eating we waited a bit for some
        cheesecake which tasted like it was made in house and was pretty good
        and creamy. We're probably there for over an hour and didn't feel rushed
        at all by the staff. To we were too distracted by Dragon Ball z on the
        TV. The employees were very nice. I don't recommend this place for an
        avid sushi eater.
