        We had an early seating at Jinsei Motto for Restaurant Week, which was a
        great start. We decided to go with the special menu, and everything was
        absolutely delicious. We also ordered the hamachi appetizer, which was
        incredibly flavorful and fresh, with no fishy taste at all.


        The only downside was the cocktails—they had some unique combinations,
        but they just weren’t to my taste. However, the outstanding food more
        than made up for it. Unfortunately, our server seemed grumpy and
        disengaged throughout the meal, which made the experience a bit awkward.


        Minus one star for the service, but overall, the sushi was fantastic,
        and we’ll definitely be back!

        We had an early seating at Jinsei Motto for Restaurant Week, which was a
        great start. We decided to go with the special menu, and everything was
        absolutely delicious. We also ordered the hamachi appetizer, which was
        incredibly flavorful and fresh, with no fishy taste at all.

        Jinsei Motto is hands down the best Japanese restaurant in Chicago! The
        fish is incredibly fresh, and every dish has such thoughtful and
        well-balanced seasonings and toppings. I absolutely love the omakase
        experience here — it’s always a treat and offers amazing value,
        especially if you come for the lunch omakase. The quality of the fish is
        top-notch, and the ambience makes the experience even more enjoyable.
        The chefs are super friendly, making each visit feel personal and
        memorable. Highly recommend for anyone craving high-quality Japanese
        cuisine in the city!

        I’m gonna start off by saying I would’ve given this restaurant 5 stars
        except for one horrible piece of sushi that was on the Omakase.


        Specifically, it was their scallop it was described as having Uni
        underneath it.


        The scallop was I think maybe piece number 10 out of 14 -  before that
        bite everything was really good. The BamBam lions,mane, the crab
        poppers, the fresh crab California roll. And also each of the Omakase
        pieces were great until the scallop !


        But as soon as both of us ate that scallop piece we wanted to gag I
        think maybe the Uni  had gone bad something - it tasted like rancid, bad
        fish like that smell underneath a dirty beach pier of like old fish. And
        I think most people eating it would just chalk this up to that’s how
        it’s supposed to taste but there’s no way! We have both had uni plenty
        before.  That ruined the entire experience for me. We talked about it
        for the rest of the night.


        if we had not had that one piece, this would’ve easily been a full five
        star experience and I would’ve gone back to them for sure

        This place is amazing. Nick is the best server. I could eat 25 Unitoro
        and not feel guilty about it. I also love their sampler option for when
        you don’t know what to get.

        Also gotta love the shots of Malort!!

        For cocktail, I love the baby shark: 12/10 I love the little peppery
        kick to it. Thank you guys!

        It was my first and last experience. I have had More delicious sushi’s
        in other places.  We ordered two rolls and a combination grill.

        The size of the food was much smaller in compare to the price.

        I got a California King for $21? Nothing really special.

        The miso soup was delicious. The grill combination was okay and normal.
        The portion size was smaller than expected.
