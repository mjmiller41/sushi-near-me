        This is a really really good place from the silent traveler to all of
        you, be safe, be well, be open. Ladies and gentlemen this is a place
        that if you want to experience Japanese culture or just Asian culture.
        This is a good place to do that you're going to experience how modern
        culture meets the past. When you walk in the door you're greeted with a
        big smile. The food is really good and there's a TV that is showing the
        chef and how he makes each dishes if you get in the right position and
        you can see it. You scan your QR code with your phone and you can get
        the menu right there or they can give you a paper menu but the latest
        and greatest is in scanning a QR code. Very nice quiet and quaint place
        for couples families and really good gatherings. Why we were there we
        had a chance to really watch and experience friends come together and
        having a really good time and celebrating something. I highly recommend
        this place inside and out. They have great Ramen and other great choices
        as well so if you're in the area and you're in the neighborhood please
        check them out you cannot go wrong.

        This is a really really good place from the silent traveler to all of
        you, be safe, be well, be open. Ladies and gentlemen this is a place
        that if you want to experience Japanese culture or just Asian culture.
        This is a good place to do that you're going to experience how modern
        culture meets the past. When you walk in the door you're greeted with a
        big smile. The food is really good and there's a TV that is showing the
        chef and how he makes each dishes if you get in the right position and
        you can see it. You scan your QR code with your phone and you can get
        the menu right there or they can give you a paper menu but the latest
        and greatest is in scanning a QR code. Very nice quiet and quaint place
        for couples families and really good gatherings. Why we were there we
        had a chance to really watch and experience friends come together and
        having a really good time and celebrating something. I highly recommend
        this place inside and out. They have great Ramen and other great choices
        as well so if you're in the area and you're in the neighborhood please
        check them out you cannot go wrong.

        My favorite Izakaya restaurant in Jackson Heights Queens. It close n
        convenient location. The atmosphere give you an old town feeling funky
        and chill at the same time. All staff are very professional and
        friendly. Food are delicious.  I love that they are open pretty late
        that I can enjoy eat out after works. Recommended.

        I love that when you walk in the door, you’ll be automatically greeted
        by the staff and brought to your table. There are also hooks on the wall
        next to your table where you can hang your coat and belongings. If you
        run out of space, the staff will help you hang it somewhere nearby. The
        staff here are very kind, patient, and friendly. Definitely a plus
        already!


        However, the food could be better. We shared the following appetizers:
        Ika Sansai (squid salad with vegetables), Tako Wasabi, Karaage Chicken,
        Mentai Mayo Fries, and the Ponzu Tuna Tataki. By choice, I only had a
        small piece of the squid salad and the wasabi octopus because they
        weren’t that great. Both were too chewy so if that’s not your type of
        texture in food, maybe avoid them. The tuna tataki had excellent
        presentation but lacks a bit of taste… kind of bland. The karage was
        pretty good with a good amount of chicken and the lemon squeezed on top
        of the juicy interior was honestly the first thing I enjoyed here. The
        best appetizer we ordered though were the mentai mayo fries. That was
        definitely a favorite for the group! The fries were crispy, hot, and the
        paired with the mentai mayo was delicious even though I’m not a big fan
        of mayo (you taste more mentai than mayo here which was a big plus for
        us).


        Speaking of mentai, we also ordered the Mentai Udon. Being a huge udon
        fan and since their mentai mayo from the fries were good, I expected a
        lot from this and was very very disappointed by it instead. This tasted
        like straight up mayo with noodles and I couldn’t eat more than a bite
        of this. I guess if you love mayo, order this? But you might as well put
        udon and mayo on a plate, mix it up and serve. Their presentation for
        this (and all their dishes) was pretty good though. The highlight was
        the bacon… when not covered in sauce.


        I also tried the chili garlic Hokkaido and the zuwaikani pasta (snow
        crab pasta). Both had a tiny but very welcome kick to it. The chili
        garlic one was overly sweet for noodles but one of us ranked this his
        favorite of the 3 noodles! The snow crab pasta was the most neutral of
        all 3. Came with lots of fish eggs and snow crab!


        I ordered the black garlic ramen to share because of all the
        recommendations to try it. I love garlic so I just had to try this. The
        ramen came with lots of mushrooms, 2 large pieces of char siu,
        scallions, and half a ramen egg. As this sets upon the table, all you
        smell is garlic! … but all you taste is also garlic. There was just too
        much garlic and after a while, it gets tiring, even for someone who
        loves garlic. Perhaps it’d be better if the black garlic came on the
        side and we could adjust it for ourselves.


        Overall, food was honestly very meh. 3/5. The service/atmosphere 4/5.


        When the bill comes, it comes in a dvd case which is pretty cute
        concept. This place is cash only!! Also, I’m not sure if they do this
        all the time, but gratuity was already included for us. It’s typical for
        restaurants to already have tip included for parties of 6 or more but we
        were only a group of 5. The staff here honestly should have said
        something. Usually staff at restaurants say something if they already
        include gratuity in the bill. Not seeing this, I included tip again… so
        read your bill carefully, people!!! … unless you want to give a 50% tip
        like I did and not realizing until hours later why the staff was so
        happy after the bill was collected… happy holidays to the staff!

        The best place ever. And such a hidden gem. Prim our server was the most
        amazing human.


        My favorites were the kimchi, and the aburi salmon salad (I ended up
        ordering two).


        My boyfriend got the black garlic ramen which looked beautiful.


        The restaurant itself was fun, cozy, inviting.


        I already want to come back.
