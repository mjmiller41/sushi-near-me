        I’ve had the pleasure of dining here several times over the past few
        years and each time has been an amazing experience. It is a Japanese run
        sushi restaurant, and most if not all of the staff are also of Japanese
        descent and speak Japanese. The food is authentic and delicious, with an
        amazing selection of sushi, sashimi, ramen, gyoza, and other Japanese
        dishes. Their menu is affordable as well, in comparison to other sushi
        restaurants I’ve visited. The restaurant itself is cozy and decorated
        with Japanese items and calligraphy quotes hand-written by the current
        owner and chef. The staff are welcoming and happy to accommodate any
        dietary needs such by as separating food items into a different plate
        for family members with allergies. It’s also common for me to run into
        Japanese friends and acquaintances because the restaurant is well known
        and popular among the Japanese community in the Denver area. Overall it
        is a restaurant with great food, a friendly ambience, and a nice
        gathering place for celebrations and get-togethers with friends and
        family.

        Traditional Japanese atmosphere. The friendliness and attentiveness that
        exemplifies the culture. Attention to detail and quality in the food
        preparation. Great happy hour pricing if you'd like to miss the dinner
        rush on a Friday. The Chef's Specials are a great way to experience this
        establishment if it's your first time. Just add an appetizer or a
        special sushi roll to the order and it's perfect for 2.

        Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to try the sushi under the
        original owner before he retired and sold to the new management. We
        tried it today for the first time… And it was just OK at best neither my
        wife nor I enjoyed any of our three sushi rolls. The Negri was pretty
        good, but nothing spectacular. The fish didn’t necessarily taste super
        fresh and the best way to describe one of the rolls was watered down.
        The staff was friendly enough and it still had a nice vibe mellow
        atmosphere inside. However, we don’t expect to come back here. Doesn’t
        seem appropriate to me that the new ownership got to keep the old name
        of the restaurant since it was named after the original owner.
