        We came for their iconic sukiyaki on a snowy day and it was perfect!
        Ordered the most basic meat option but the quality was already nice and
        enough for us. We walked in around 4pm without a reservation and the
        place wasn’t crowded, creating a really cozy atmosphere. Highly
        recommend to come around this time. All staffs were nice and their plum
        sparkling drink was good as well😌

        Small and tight Japanese restaurant in UES, exuding ambience of a
        typical restaurant in Tokyo. We had beef sukiyaki don (for the no-sushi
        in our party of three,) a grilled mackerel, plus a sushi assortment.
        Also had a monk fish liver (ankimo,) chef’s special of the day.

        Very satisfied with the quality of the food.

        Great experience and awesome service.  Highly recommend to get the
        sukiyaki (soy sauce based) with udon. They use egg as the dipping sauce
        with beef.  Yum!

        the sashimi and sushi platter is high quality.

        For appetizers: sesame tofu with Uni is very interesting.

        The waiter is friendly, knowledgeable and fun to chat with.

        We will def revisit.

        Decent Experience at Momokawa


        I recently dined at Momokawa, and while it wasn’t bad, it didn’t quite
        live up to my expectations.


        The ambiance was nice and cozy, with a traditional Japanese vibe, and
        the service was decent—attentive enough, though nothing particularly
        stood out.


        As for the food, it was decent but not great. The sushi was fine, but
        they didn’t blow me away. The sukiyaki, which I was looking forward to,
        was decent. Everything was cooked well, but the flavors didn’t quite
        pop.


        One thing to keep in mind is that Momokawa is on the pricier end, which
        made the “just decent” meal feel a bit underwhelming for the cost.
        Overall, it’s not a bad spot, but not amazing.

        Service was very helpful and kind. I came during a not so busy time for
        lunch and was served very quickly. I got the set menu. I thought the
        shashimi was okay as well as the set of five apps- i felt like flavours
        were a bit all over the place (taste was good for the most part but my
        palette was a bit confused). The meat for the shabu shabu was really
        good though and the whole thing was super filling! I felt like the
        deserts wasn’t my favourite as well though tbh. Definitely come for
        shabu shabu or yakiniku 👌
