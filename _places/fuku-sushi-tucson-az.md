        Last week, I was having a very tough day. I walked into Fuku for the
        first time. I ordered a spicy tuna roll to go and a veggie tempura for
        there. I had asked the waitress about fried tofu, which she kindly let
        me know they did not serve. Joseph(one of the chefs) asked what exactly
        I wanted.. I just said a piece of fried tofu.. but what followed was
        this! ❤️ Thank you so much, Joseph, David, and Ruby, for making my night
        such a kind, nemerable one. See you soon.

        I ordered 2 hand rolls the tuna & yellowtail because they looked
        delicious from the pictures online. However, when I received them they
        looked nothing like the pictures online. I received just a piece of
        tuna, cucumber & rice wrapped in seaweed. It was dry and inedible. From
        the pictures online the tuna was diced & tossed in a sauce with chopped
        green onion. I tried calling during normal business hours to discuss
        what happened but the phone just rang until a voicemail intercepted.
        Below are pictures of what I received verses the pictures/descriptions
        that are advertised online.

        I hate to be one of those people but dang I spend my hard earned money
        on food that should be delicious. Especially since I am not a sushi
        person and we have never tried this place but we see people always
        ordering. So we decided to get takeout and when placing an order a girl
        answered and put me on hold and then hung up. I called again pretty sure
        she knew it was me because she didn’t get my name or phone number. She
        gave me the total and time it would be ready. So we go and my husband is
        waiting to get help and two other customers come in and he still hasn’t
        been helped and it wasn’t busy it was 9:15pm they close at 2am. Finally
        she walks over which I am assuming it was her because she was the only
        one working behind the counter other then a guy. She gives my husband
        the order pulls a card reader out sees my husband getting cash and says
        “let me get the change from my purse” and my husband was shocked because
        like what?? He comes to the car and tells me this and says she gave me
        $14 in cash and I’m shocked because I have never heard of an employee
        doing this. So we get home excited thinking it was gonna be at least
        good. No we barley got any food like the sushi rolls were so small and
        thin and we ordered 3 sushi rolls each $15 except one $12 and it looked
        like a mess each roll didn’t look appealing and again I’m not a sushi
        person so we get this once in awhile but I have eaten at other sushi
        places and I can say other places charge way less for more or it’s
        pricey but it’s good sushi if that make sense. Recommend our regular
        spot! Sushi Lito! So yeah I am disappointed in this experience because
        it’s supposedly “good”. Definitely don’t recommend.

        Had a horrible experience. Came in with my husband and the waitress was
        so rude to us immediately upon arrival. I asked for a sprite however it
        was really watered down so I had asked for a different soda. She rolled
        her eyes and gave me the meanest look. My husbands food had hair in it
        and so did mine. The manager did not want to help us and forced us to
        pay. 0/10 experience.

        Everything was ok about this place except for the fact they stop serving
        food at 9pm. Perhaps it was a weekend thing, perhaps not either way, I
        would've liked to have the opportunity for dine in but every company has
        a reason for doing things the way they do. Waited 30 minutes and wasn't
        even offered a water. And the preselected tip was 30%, not the standard
        15%. That was wild. If they paid their staff enough (& trained them
        better), they wouldn’t have to default to customers forming over such
        large tips. They would feel comfortable giving that instead.

  Insights from Recent Feedback$$$Visitors to this sushi spot often praise the
  friendly service and thoughtful touches that make for memorable meals, though
  some mention occasional inconsistencies in portion sizes and food
  presentation. Many appreciate the lively vibe and quick preparation,
  especially for takeout or delivery when craving Japanese-inspired eats close
