        Best sushi restaurant in Oakland (but there's more than just sushi to be
        enjoyed here!).


        Fish and all ingredients in general are super fresh and
        locally/carefully sourced.


        Atmosphere is super cute and the owners are just fantastic hosts that
        will make you feel at home the second after you enter.


        Located super strategically in DT oakland a block away from Bart station
        (12th Street).


        Super recommended ✨

        a very nice joint with a friendly attentive staff.


        fish is fresh and presentation is cool.


        I found the tempura sauce a little bit sweet and a few of the okamase
        sashimi a little odd (the salmon marinated in beets was a fail in my
        opinion)


        but all in all a cool place with good sushi.

        This is my first time ever writing a restaurant review but I thought it
        necessary because my experience was so lovely! All the food was
        delicious and unique. Many of the rolls were unique to this location and
        everything was top quality but not overly pricey for the quality. The
        vibe of the restaurant was excellent with ambient music and lovely
        decor. They used quality ingredients and real crab in the sushi which is
        always nice. I especially loved the cherry blossom rolls. The staff
        there were all lovely and welcoming.

        Happy that there’s a sushi restaurant that serves affordable omakase
        walking distance from me in downtown Oakland.


        I ordered the 10pc omakase which was only $49, and came with some
        premium bites like hotate scallop and toro. The most unique bite for me
        was the beet cured salmon, vibrant color but you can actually taste the
        beet flavor as well.


        Highly recommend if you want to scratch that itch for some premium sushi
        on this side of the bay.

        Khatan, a hidden gem in the Bay Area, is a must-try for sushi lovers! I
        was blown away by their sake sashimi, which was melt-in-your-mouth
        perfection. The Lake Merritt roll with a sour ponzu hamachi was another
        standout.


        The owners, who are incredibly friendly and welcoming, are clearly
        passionate about their craft. It's amazing to think they've only been
        open for 10 days! Highly recommended!
