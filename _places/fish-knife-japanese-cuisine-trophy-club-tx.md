        This place was super cute, great for maybe a date night or a quick
        lunch. I came in for lunch and they had a decent amount of happy hour
        specials which is what I ordered.

        The happy hour rolls are super small in comparison to a authentic Sushi
        roll but for the price it was definitely worth it I'd say. Only negative
        was one server which didn't seem too happy. The other two were great!
        They seemed older so I can see why she could have been unhappy. Despite
        that it was pretty good.

        This place is not authentic or okay nothing to revisit.  I ordered
        calamari as starter.  I got fried fake crab chunky sticks.  Upon seeing
        it, I thought this calamari is thick and so shaped like crab sticks.  I
        tried one and yes it has no taste and was not calamari.  I motioned to
        the male waiter and shared I ordered calamari and this wasn’t calamari. 
        He responded yes it is.  I said no this is fake crab sticks not
        calamari.  He insisted on getting the box from the kitchen.  This fake
        crab sticks calamari came from a processed fish food factory.  So I said
        to him who was obviously offended.  You are offended I don't want this
        so I would like to get something else.  He said,  he won’t be getting
        anything else as I will say it is not what it is and this is calamari. 
        So he was telling me to leave basically as I complained n exposed there
        fake meat i won’t be served another dish.  By this point the man is
        putting his hand in my face and too close to me.  I asked him, What is
        he doing, take your hands out of my face.  You are taking this
        personal.  I know calamari and what you served me is not it.  He went
        off in a rant by himself came back still ranting to another employee. 
        How does one chef or any chef get calamari to be as thick as fake grab
        meat sticks?  Needless to say we went to Il Calabrese where my husband
        originally wanted to go. No I don’t recommend Fish n Knife for authentic
        fish or seafood and as for the customer service it was like the fake
        grab meat they attempt to pass off as calamari.  Garbage!

        I’ve been here several times and I’m never disappointed. The food is
        excellent and the staff is very friendly. Also, the restrooms are always
        clean! They serve drinks that I’m told are great as well, but I don’t
        drink.

        Been here many times times since moving to the area. Staff is always
        pleasant and attentive. Food is phenomenal! Flavor never let's me down.
        Their mustard dipping sauce is flipping awesome. I come here a couple
        times a week. Can't have certain foods but they offer a lot of variety, 
        it isn't easy to pick just one or two. I usually end up with 3-4 rolls
        each time. Pictures are of Mochi, Tempera banana, cowboy roll, fish
        cake, dancing dragon and fire cracker.

        I paid 30.00 dollars for a to go order that was supposed to be dinner
        sized. I also paid extra for fried rice. I got chicken and steak and
        there was maybe 5 pieces or meat each and white rice not fried rice. It
        doesn't tell you your meal comes with vegetables so I ordered some and
        that was the best part. The meat wasn't soft at all and the rice was
        wrong. Why when u eat to go they dont give u the same service as if your
        sitting in their restaurant.  I wish they had pictures of the food
        online because I wouldn't of ordered this meal if I know it was this
        skimpy for 30.00
