        A very nice experience overall. The staff was polite, and ordering from
        the table-side tablets was convenient. The service was a bit on the
        slower side, but the sushi made up for it—it was absolutely incredible.
        The “Mission Roll” is a must-try and comes highly recommended. A solid
        spot for sushi lovers!

        Loved the chicken curry katsu. The sushi was fresh. We tried the rainbow
        roll, and it was good. Their edmame was also pretty large, which was
        great with the drinks. Would go there again .

        Definitely a go to spot for when I’m in little Tokyo with a group,
        they’ve got decent prices on a good burger and fries. Their ramen was
        pretty good and so was the fried rice. Never get a chance to try the
        sushi out but I’m sure it’s great. Service was friendly, and bathroom
        located inside. They also validate parking.

        The service was good and the rice dishes and sushi were very good;
        however, I do not recommend getting the ramen. The ramen tasted exactly
        like the Nissin Roah instant ramen and was very bland and overpriced.
        The toppings were basic and the roasted pork lacked seasoning. But on
        the other hand the pork cutlet bento worth the price. It had large
        portions and the food was good. The yellowtail hand roll was fresh and
        tasty. Overall the rice dishes was good but the ramen was not it

        Came here for a chill lunch and they were the only place in the area
        open early in the day around 11am. The atmosphere was good, I really
        liked the music choice. Mostly ordered from the tablet, table service
        was ok. Servers were nice enough. The plates were chipped, and I really
        didn’t like that. Photo provided.


        Unfortunately the food was quite hit or miss. The Katsu bento as
        pictured in my review was quite bad despite good presentation; 5/10.
        chicken was extremely dry, I’m used to ono Hawaiian BBQ for katsu and
        this plate paled in comparison. Possibly was just overcooked. The
        tempura that came with was undercooked on the other hand, and the
        veggies were raw in the center. Not a good option.


        As for the sushi which most of us are going for anyway though, it was
        good. I especially enjoyed the tempura salmon roll, which was a stuffed
        baked salmon roll with the entire roll itself then fried in tempura
        batter. This was a delicious sushi and the highlight of the meal, a
        8/10.


        Lastly I got an order of the fried calamari and it wasn’t bad either, a
        solid 7/10 fried crispy and tasty.


        Overall the restaurant is probably a 7/10 for me. I’d come back under
        similar circumstances and just stick to the sushi.
