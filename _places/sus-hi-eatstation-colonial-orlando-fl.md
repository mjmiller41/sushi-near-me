        Orlando, and one of the things that she missed the most were these deep
        fried sushi burritos. So every time she comes back for a visit, we
        inevitably come to a Sus-Hi Eatstation for one of our meals.


        We had never been to this location before, so we thought we'd explore a
        little bit. Loved the location. Being so close to the Mills 50
        intersection is prime real estate. Ambiance was the coolest I've seen in
        one of these. Video game station, board games to play, nerd art for sale
        everywhere. Really neat.


        Service was fine. There's no real service anymore, as Sus-Hi's have gone
        to the kiosk, so meal accuracy is always high, but it just stinks,
        taking away that human element. The speed of the meal was questionable,
        but I also realize that the four of us all ordered fried elements, and
        they probably only have so many fryers back there.


        But anyway, when the food itself got out to us, it was the same
        excellent quality that Sus-Hi always puts out. The burrito was fried to
        perfection. Such a perfect crisp on the outside, not greasy at all, and
        through some ninja sorcery, all of the fillings stay held in place
        solidly, no shifting or spillage. A modern feat of engineering.


        I also got to try one of their cold noodle bowls, which is one of my
        favorite items of theirs right now. Those cold noodles hold on to the
        sauces very well, but don't absorb them too much, muting their flavor,
        so you get a lot of flavor in every bite. Add in some tempura fried
        proteins to get some great texture in your meal. Love that Triple X
        sauce.


        Overall, I've had a love-hate relation with Sus-Hi over the years, but I
        just can't quit them. I'll be back. I always come back.

        Whats the point of recommending SAUCE ON TOP AS THE BEST OPTION… and
        yall don’t even put sauce on it or on the side. This is my second time
        that this exact same thing happens with my Uber eats order. No sauce on
        the side or on top.. so bland.

        3nd time here for pickup order. Food ordered well ahead of time, and the
        staff seems to be going at a leisurely pace again.


        Right now looking at 5 bowls that have been sitting on their counter
        with an employee that walked away for about 5 minutes to use the
        bathroom, and two other employees having a conversation in the back.


        Saw the bowls I was picking up sitting on the counter for roughly 14
        minutes by the time they were done and handed to me.

        The visuals are just what you want, but the execution is indicative of
        the attention being paid by staff and the management. It started rough
        when the dumplings arrived cold and raw, where they were attached to one
        another... comes with the territory when the hot and cold food comes at
        the same time. The soba noodle dish we ordered was made wrong in this
        photo and again when we brought it up. We gave up on getting it correct.
        There was seafood in a non seafood dish.... one on accident and the
        other on purpose, although incorrect. This wasn't what we would call
        "money well spent." This is my 3rd Sus Hi location visit, and I won't
        keep trying them out.
