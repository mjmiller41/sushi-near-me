        Tried this place out for the first time and our family enjoyed it! The
        little train to deliver drinks and special orders was cute and the food
        was delicious. The spicy sushi was definitely more spicy than some
        places. We enjoyed it but some who are more sensitive to spice may need
        to proceed with caution. We did wait a good while to get refills on
        drinks but the staff was overall kind.

        So cute!! You sit by the conveyor belt and dishes come by. Plates are
        priced by color, or you can do the all you can eat option. Portion sizes
        per plate are pretty good, about half a roll to a plate, or two
        specialty items. They also put desserts and those Ramune sodas out as
        options, and have a selection of meals that come from the kitchen and
        are delivered by a little train to your table. Wait staff are polite,
        helpful, and attentive. We had an excellent time and would definitely
        recommend.

        Sushi Pro is totally worth the experience! But be forewarned - it is
        incredible dangerous having so many scrumptious dishes chugging along
        next to you for the picking! Dangerous because your belly can be at risk
        in busting, and your pocketbook can be at risk of withering away! My
        daughter and I took on the experience with glee, and within about 45
        minutes, we had two tall stacks of empty plates on our table, and we
        were both gently patting out bellies!


        The concept is somewhat unique in America, but not so much in China. A
        conveyor belt brings out an endless stream of sushi rolls, appetizers,
        side dishes, and desserts - you just pick whatever you want.
        Conveniently placed signs on the conveyor belt describe what the
        following items are along with a price, so you know exactly what you are
        taking.


        Traditional items ordered from the kitchen are delivered to the tables
        by a radio controlled train. It just doesn't get much cooler than this!


        You do have a choice of paying per plate taken, or all you can eat.
        They've got it figured out - the cost was about identical based on what
        we took compared to all you can eat. The waitress was also nice in
        telling us that she'd calculate it both ways and charge us for the
        lesser of the two.


        I'd rate the sushi about a 6 or 7 out of 10. There is definitely better
        and worse out there. But I'd opt for Sushi Pro given the ability to try
        small portions of a lot of different dishes. The boba drinks are not
        that great though - we'll stick to waters next time.


        If I'm super hungry and want some variety, this is the place I'd go!

        I was surprized real Sushi than I thought.
        The nigiri's rice is little soft to me, but fishes are good.
        Other sides are not bad.
        If you would like to eat much, strongly recommend all you can eat.
        It's really reasonable.
        Staff is also nice.
        Kids were excited to revolving plates and many kind of Ramune.
        The only disappointment was that the yellowtail was sold out.
        So, I'll have to go again, lol.

        This was a fun and great experience for sushi. The concept isn't new,
        but new to Utah, so that was great to experience. We did the all you can
        eat with our son who loves sushi and this was a great way for him to try
        new things.
