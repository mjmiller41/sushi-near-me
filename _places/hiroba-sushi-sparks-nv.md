        All the chefs were great and the food was amazing. I never had to wait
        for anything and everyone was really friendly. This is by far one of my
        favorite places in the Reno/Sparks area to get sushi.

        Hiroba Sushi may be tucked away in a strip mall, but don’t let its
        unassuming exterior fool you. While the décor and ambiance might not
        immediately catch your eye, what awaits you inside is nothing short of
        culinary excellence. This is a place where taste and quality take center
        stage, and the experience is far beyond what you might expect from its
        location.Taste and Quality: A Culinary DelightThe real star of Hiroba
        Sushi is, without a doubt, the food. From the moment the first dish
        arrives at your table, it's clear that the chefs here take immense pride
        in their craft. The sushi is consistently fresh, bursting with flavor,
        and presented with an attention to detail that rivals some of the more
        high-end sushi restaurants. Each piece of sushi is a testament to the
        quality of the ingredients and the skill of the chefs.The menu offers a
        wide variety of options, catering to both traditionalists who love the
        classics and adventurous eaters looking for something new. Whether you
        opt for a simple tuna roll or one of their more inventive specialty
        rolls, you can expect a symphony of flavors that delight your taste
        buds. The balance of textures and flavors in each dish is masterful,
        making it clear that the team behind the sushi bar has honed their craft
        to perfection.Service: Warm and AttentiveThe service at Hiroba Sushi is
        another highlight of the dining experience. The staff is not only
        knowledgeable about the menu but also genuinely friendly and eager to
        ensure that your meal is enjoyable. Whether you’re a first-time visitor
        or a regular, you’ll be treated with the same level of care and
        attention. The servers are prompt, courteous, and always willing to
        offer recommendations if you’re unsure about what to order.Ambiance:
        Simple, Yet ComfortableWhile the ambiance might not be the most
        luxurious, it is comfortable and clean, providing a pleasant setting to
        enjoy your meal. The simplicity of the décor allows the food to shine
        and the warm atmosphere created by the staff makes you feel right at
        home. It's a reminder that sometimes the best dining experiences are
        found in the most unexpected places.Conclusion: A Must-Visit for Sushi
        LoversIn a world where so much emphasis is placed on flashy interiors
        and trendy locations, Hiroba Sushi stands out as a restaurant that lets
        its food do the talking. It may not have the most ingenious design, but
        what it lacks in aesthetics, it more than makes up for in taste and
        quality. If you’re a sushi lover, this is one place you simply must try.
        The high-quality ingredients, exceptional taste, and warm, attentive
        service make Hiroba Sushi a hidden gem worth discovering. Don’t let the
        strip mall location deter you—once you taste the sushi here, you’ll be
        planning your next visit before you even leave the restaurant.

        If Woo Jun is my server, then it's smooth sailing. If he isn't there;
        I'll sit at the bar. We've grown fond of this place over the years.
        Sushi is always up to par, and their staff takes great care of my
        family. We always order AYCE and never wait too long for our orders. The
        Philadelphia and the Golden Gate are a few of my favorite rolls. Uzura
        is a must!


        I've had a mishap with a female server taking cash and giving me the
        wrong change. I was rushing back to work since I was on my lunch and
        noticed she shorted me on top of being rude. I still tipped her,
        although it was against my better judgment. As a woman, it pains me to
        say that the service I've received from the woman here is not acceptable
        nor deserving of a tip.


        Here's a tip: if you're paying with cash, check your change if your
        server isn't Woo Jun. Beware of the not so happy older Hispanic lady if
        she happens to serve you.


        Despite these few mishaps, the rest of the crew is great. We come back
        for the sushi and them.

        Food was a complete miss tonight 12/20

        Came in Starving around 7:45 For a party of 2 & have always heard great
        things about this place, hence why we tried it tonight.

        We were was sat right away & ordered Apps ( Mussels, Calamari)

        Which were super cold and chewy.

        Then ordered 4 rolls that were average at best (2/10.)

        We got grossed out by the Quality of the food and Just asked for the
        tab.

        $72 For below average sushi and apps for 2 people was a huge lesson we
        learned and wanted to share with everyone.

        The service was good & fast, that was the only plus.

        Besides that save your $ and go to Somewhere else. :(
