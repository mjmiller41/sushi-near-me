        A small group of us tried Akeno Sushi for the first time, and I loved
        it. We had a late dinner reservation and the restaurant was full. It’s a
        small restaurant with two levels for seating. Be cautions of the stairs.
        There’s steps leading to the restaurant, then if you sit upstairs of the
        second level of the restaurant itself there are two or three additional
        stairwells. The seating is pretty tight and close together so you don’t
        have much personal space sitting, but the overall experience was great!
        We had three courses of sushi, cocktails, and entrees. I absolutely
        loved my food. My friends tried cooked sushi for the first time, and
        they really enjoyed their selection of cooked sushi. They entree wasn’t
        what they anticipated, but they still ate their meals and had a pleasant
        time.

        A small group of us tried Akeno Sushi for the first time, and I loved
        it. We had a late dinner reservation and the restaurant was full. It’s a
        small restaurant with two levels for seating. Be cautions of the stairs.
        There’s steps leading to the restaurant, then if you sit upstairs of the
        second level of the restaurant itself there are two or three additional
        stairwells. The seating is pretty tight and close together so you don’t
        have much personal space sitting, but the overall experience was great!
        We had three courses of sushi, cocktails, and entrees. I absolutely
        loved my food. My friends tried cooked sushi for the first time, and
        they really enjoyed their selection of cooked sushi. They entree wasn’t
        what they anticipated, but they still ate their meals and had a pleasant
        time.

        Overall quite a nice dining experience, and the food was good but not
        necessarily epic. Friendly and fairly attentive service, and casual
        atmosphere.


        We had the following items:


        Avocado Salad (Avocado / tomato / mixed green / sweet miso dressing) -
        very generous amounts of fresh avocado paired well with the sweet miso
        dressing, very nice start to the meal.


        Spicy Garlic Edamame (Steamed soybeans / jalapeno / garlic / chili
        pepper / miso paste) - really nice garlic and miso flavor with these
        beans, and just a little bit of heat to make them even more enjoyable


        Crab Rangoons (Imitation crab / cream cheese / scallion / sweet chili
        sauce) - pretty standard as far as crab rangoons go, nothing too
        remarkable but enjoyable


        Kurobuta Sausage (Japanese pork sausages / spicy mayo & honey mustard
        sauce) - this was probably the only real disappointment, just really
        underwhelming in terms of flavor


        Chicken Gyoza (Pan fried chicken and vegetable dumplings / sesame ponzu
        sauce) - good but again otherwise unremarkable


        Panang Curry (Red creamy curry / coconut milk / red bell pepper /
        steamed broccoli) - this was fine but probably on the lower end of
        panang curries I've enjoyed, just a bit watery and lacking any depth in
        flavor


        Amako Masuri (Spicy crunchy salmon topped Salmon / avocado / red tobiko
        / spicy mayo).- solid, well prepared specialty roll,  well presented as
        well


        Sashimi Plate (12 pcs chef’s finest selection of sashimi / miso soup) -
        this was a disappointment overall, didn't taste fresh, especially for
        sashimi


        Worth a try if you're a local, but not something we'd drive back to
        Capitol Hill for.

        Came here for a sushi making class and had a great time! Our chef was
        very helpful and patient with our group in showing us how to properly
        make sushi rolls. We taste tested our own sushi and it was delicious. We
        had the salmon, tuna, and shrimp. The staff seemed very friendly and
        willing to help. Recommend this experience!

        I have been here two times and every time they hit the mark! If you
        don’t go here, you’re missing out! You seriously can’t go wrong with any
        of the sushi or drinks! Can’t wait until my next visit!

        Going up the stairs you are Wowed away by this beautiful pic of a
        peacock, but unfortunately the wowness ended there. We ordered the Katsu
        curry, Basil chicken fried rice and a Passion Rita. They brought out my
        husband’s food 9 minutes before mine (of course I was keeping track).
        And thank god they gave him cucumbers that I nibbled on while waiting
        for my food. When my highly anticipated katsu curry came out it was
        cooked fast believe it or not bc it was over cooked. The Passion Rita
        was gorg, but nothing that would make me want to come back. We gave two
        stars bc the basil chicken fried rice was the best out of everything,
        but again nothing that would make us want to re-visit or recommend to
        friends.
