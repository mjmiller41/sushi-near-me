        My husband and I have celebrated both of our birthdays here, and each
        visit has been an exceptional experience. Chef Sean is incredibly polite
        and attentive, and the ambience is warm and comfortable. It’s truly our
        favorite spot for sushi. We ordered the Chef’s Choice 14-Piece Nigiri
        and the Premium Kaisen Don—both were beautifully presented and
        absolutely delicious. We can’t wait to come back again.

        I had a fantastic experience at this restaurant! Everything tasted fresh
        and well-balanced, and the prices were reasonable for the quality. The
        atmosphere was cozy, with just a few places to sit, which made it a
        lovely setting. Honestly, I enjoyed it more than some omakase places in
        Seattle that came with hefty price tags.

        I've been wanting to try this place for a long time now but always
        forgot to be quick with the reservation system. It's not hard to get
        into as long as you watch his social for the update. Typically on
        Sundays every two weeks he opens the reservations. You preorder what you
        want and pay half the total as a down payment. One man running the whole
        restaurant and he's definitely putting in work!


        We snagged a 4pm on a Saturday and had ordered the premium don bowl,
        chefs nigiri special and two extra pieces of otoro nigiri. We literally
        just got back from Japan a month ago before visiting this place and it
        slaps! Definitely high quality, he made the order fresh and we gobbled
        it up so quickly. Reminded us of the sushi we ate in Japan! Highly
        recommend the premium don. You get to try a variety of seafood with a
        little or a lot of rice. The rice was flavorful too hiding underneath
        everything. And the nigiri special. Had a few of the same fish but there
        were other pieces I didn't have. Hard to share though as it's only one
        of each type so my husband and I would take half bites. Haha.


        My husband ended up coming back to this place with his friends for their
        birthday. They all loved it! Highly recommend.

        Hands down the best sushi restaurant in the PNW. Small place, I believe
        the chef only serves one table at a time, so booking is tight. We waited
        about a week before we got a slot. When you do place your reservation,
        you will also need to order your dishes in advance.  It's a very
        personal experience, which is great because it lets us appreciate the
        quality of sushi. We ordered the chirashi bowl and omakase, and it's the
        best that we've ever had.

        After weeks of trying, we finally secured a reservation—and it was well
        worth the wait! This hidden gem offers an intimate dining experience,
        perfect for couples or solo diners at the bar. The one-man show by the
        chef creates a unique and personal touch. He was incredibly kind and
        attentive throughout the meal.


        The highlight was the 14-piece chef’s choice nigiri, featuring fresh
        fish sourced from around the world—some of the best quality we’ve ever
        had. We also tried two additional rolls but found ourselves satisfied
        after the set. (Rolls were also very good for the price) For the quality
        and experience, this omakase is an incredible value. Highly recommended!
