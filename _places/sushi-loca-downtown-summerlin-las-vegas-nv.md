        Came here for my friendâs birthday, and it was such a fun time! The
        place has a cute and cozy vibe, and our waitress was the sweetestâshe
        even brought us free desserts to celebrate! The sashimi was insanely
        fresh and easily the best part of the meal. Such a great spot for a
        chill night out with good food and awesome service. Definitely coming
        back!

        Excellent place for lunch.  The menu selections are vast sushi, sashimi,
        tempura, hibachi, soba, udon the list goes on...  We split a shrimp
        tempura that was very lightly battered and the fresh shrimp were plump
        and juicy.  Take advantage of the lunch special, you receive miso soup,
        your choice of one sushi roll and a selection of delicious fresh sushi
        and a dessert.

        Spacious and cute with floral decor, this sushi spot in Downtown
        Summerlin has a great vibe. I did not expect this place to be this good.
        The staff is friendly and attentive, and while the rolls are good, the
        premium sashimi combo is a must-try. If you're in Summerlin and want
        sushi with a glass of wine, i would say this is the place.

        Price is a bit on the higher side compares to the other places, because
        it's not an AYCE spot, but I could understand because of its location
        and the food quality was great. You can always sit at the bar and ask
        chef for recommendations. I also love that the owner was there and
        giving us complimentary salad and soup.

        Tried this place for the first time and the food was honestly great.
        Itâs definitely on the pricier side, but the qualityâs there. The decor
        inside is beautiful too, really well done and gives the place a nice
        vibe.


        What really threw me off was how rushed everything felt, especially
        considering the restaurant wasnât even busy. I had just sat down when I
        was asked for my drink order before I could even open the menu. Not long
        after, I was being asked about appetizers with barely any time to
        decide. It felt like they were in a hurry to move me through the meal
        for no clear reason.


        The staff were polite, but the pushy pacing made the whole thing feel
        rushed and uncomfortable. I really wouldâve appreciated just a little
        more time to settle in.

        Wow! The creativity of the names and the flavor interested me and my
        wife when we first moved to Vegas. We laughed quite a bit  by the names
        of the sushi actually.  But what a great taste. The greeters/front of
        restaurant set the tone with me. They even gave me a complimentary side
        just because or perhaps I order big when I go there lol.  Very much so
        wished they were located where I lived in Texas last year . Very good
