        If I could give it a ZERO star, I would solely from the fact that they
        will FORCE you to tip according to their “recommended” tip chart. What
        we tipped wasn’t good enough and the waitress kept pointing at the tip
        scale. We asked if it was ‘required’ (which we knew it isn’t) and the
        waitress said she didn’t know what we meant. She literally hovered over
        our shoulder and even was ADDING on a separate paper to make sure we
        added it correctly. We tried speaking up but we were just too
        dumbfounded about the entire situation. To those that experience the
        same thing, please report them to the BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU. I would
        hate for those to be forced and feel violated when it comes to our own,
        hard earned money. It is not a situation anyone should experience and
        after reading the many reviews from other platforms, this isn’t the
        first, second, or even third time it has happened. It is a REOCCURRING
        problem. Our experience wasn’t bad but once finances comes into play and
        they act like they can force people to pay a certain way, the entire
        experience is ruined all together.


        PS: to clarify, our tip was a few dollars short from what they recommend
        but at the end of the day, it’s the principle of it all.

        If I could give it a ZERO star, I would solely from the fact that they
        will FORCE you to tip according to their “recommended” tip chart. What
        we tipped wasn’t good enough and the waitress kept pointing at the tip
        scale. We asked if it was ‘required’ (which we knew it isn’t) and the
        waitress said she didn’t know what we meant. She literally hovered over
        our shoulder and even was ADDING on a separate paper to make sure we
        added it correctly. We tried speaking up but we were just too
        dumbfounded about the entire situation. To those that experience the
        same thing, please report them to the BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU. I would
        hate for those to be forced and feel violated when it comes to our own,
        hard earned money. It is not a situation anyone should experience and
        after reading the many reviews from other platforms, this isn’t the
        first, second, or even third time it has happened. It is a REOCCURRING

        I was denied access to the front of the restaurant because I have a
        service dog. I have difficulty walking and asked to be seated near the
        buffet to make it easier on me. The manager said no, I had to sit in the
        back. As more people came in and were seated near the buffet, I asked to
        speak to the manager. After he made us wait about 10 minutes, he came
        out. I asked why I had to be seated in the rear of the restaurant? He
        said it is the only area he allows service dogs. I told him he was not
        allowed to discriminate against me or my dog, but he refused to let us
        sit elsewhere.

        I did file a complaint with local authorities and the ADA.gov for his
        treatment and behavior. I truly appreciate the support from other
        patrons.

        We were hoping to have a great buffet to go to on our seasonal stay in
        Naples. We arrived before 4pm after being at the gym next door to pay
        $15 lunch. We confirmed in advanced that arriving  before 4pm  cost $30
        when we artivef we confirmed with the hostess who also had a person come
        over to us to confirm  what she had said.

        When we received our bill it was $20 pp. we told our server it was
        supposed to be $15pp. Manager said no, and after much discussion &
        explanation, he would not budge because a dinner item of coconut shrimp
        was now on the serving table. Then he said you have to LEAVE by 4p….
        WHAT…WOW!! False advertising!!!!

        Food-fair, server was nice. Manager-very unprofessional, poor
        temperament on how he handles our situation for $10 & obviously not a
        smart business man… at all. ( I own my own business)

        Unfortunately, they have lost us as customers.

        A good experience is shared once, a bad experience is shared many.

        Good luck & tread careful is you eat here.

        Based on the reviews, I don't see a hibachi. I don't think I want to try
        it. 3 stars for take your guess buffet! 20$ do they serve any adult
        beverages? I'll take my chances at the clam house I passed on my way
        here.


        Maybe you should listen to the people and reply... Customer service is a
        good thing.

        They should work on there customer service skills and get new pots and
        pans so it won’t leave any mysterious residues on the food, they would
        get more tips if the serves were extra friendly (extra cash in there
        pocket) minimum service is for a minimum tip especially for the quality
        of food too matches the price overall please work on customer service
        skills and not argue with each other on the floor. Looks unprofessional
        and scary
