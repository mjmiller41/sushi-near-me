        The steak is perfect, medium rare is set perfect. The chicken is tender
        and moist. The veggies were delicious. The potatoes were incredible. The
        rice was delicious and not clumped.


        The portions were just right, definitely on the generous side. You will
        leave very satisfied.


        And the carrot cake! Wow!! A huge slice, be prepared to share. And the
        taste is incredible.


        The atmosphere is modern and artsy. Very pleasant dining.


        And if there is an issue with anything, they will take care of it. Thank
        you to Jessica and the staff.

        Great service and food tonight with Hamid as our server. This was our
        first time and we'll definitely be back. They have great Happy Hour
        deals. Everything we ate was delicious and well worth it. We had a
        reservation but it wasn't overlly packed. Favorites tonight was the
        shrimp tempura, salmon and Steak.

        Had dinner here Sunday evening at 6pm. We walked in and were seated
        right away. Service was attentive and checked in regularly to see if we
        needed anything. It's a beautiful space and if you sit in the bar area
        you can see the beautiful fountain in the courtyard.


        I ordered the lemon garlic penne with shrimp and my friend ordered the
        same with chicken. I told him we were at a seafood place and he should
        have ordered it with shrimp. After I gave him a piece of shrimp, he
        agreed.


        After dinner, I switched over to the bar. The bartender was nice. I
        ordered an espresso martini, of course and waited for another friend to
        join me. My friend wanted a red wine and had two glasses.


        The manager came to ask how things were and if we needed anything, we
        didn't and it was going great. I told him I was visiting from Phoenix,
        Arizona and he mentioned that he moved here about a year ago from there
        and liked it here. We had a great conversation and I appreciated his
        advice and insight.

        Beautiful facilities and friendly staff. I believe two different
        managers check up on us for lunch on a Friday afternoon. The food was
        delicious and served pipping hot 🔥. Our server/bartender got our order
        just right. Highly recommend you stop in to Kona Grill.

        Hamid was our server tonight and he was very kind and attentive. I
        ordered the lemon garlic penne and my husband had the surf and turf. The
        food and drinks were very good, but Hamid's service was the best part.
        He was very attentive and kept checking on us to make sure we had
        everything we needed, but also gave us our privacy and space. Will
        definitely come back, thanks to him!
