        Food/Taste/Flavor: 5/5 - ordered 3 rolls of Dancing Eel, Sun of the
        Beach, and Don't Cry Amigo. While the rolls looked a bit small, it was
        quite filling. All of the tools were yummy and the ingredients tasted
        fresh. We really appreciate that the sauces come on the side but are
        labeled so we know which goes together. We really like the spicy mayo
        eel sauce that came with sun of the beach but didn't care for the garlic
        ponzu hot sauce that came with don't cry amigo.


        Service: 5/5 - ordered at the counter to go, and Jericho was super
        friendly and helped make a few recommendations


        Ambiance: n/a - ordered food to go. Quite busy as we consistently saw
        people coming in And out


        Value for price: 5/5 - decent price at around $12 per roll but there can
        be quite a wait depending on the time you get there. The parking lot is
        quite chaotic

        Absolutely loved this place.   First time eating here but as someone
        that loves sushi, I can honestly say this place was top notch.  Loved
        the variety of rolls and the nigiri was incredible.   Also highly
        recommend the seafood salad.

        I will start with the Cons:

        I would agree with the comments about the seating being cramp. Also, we
        got there at around 1pm and there was still a wait time. We had to wait
        at least 30 minutes but I didnt mind it because the menu and the fast
        service made it up for it.


        Pros:

        Food- the extensive menu was amazing. I have eaten in different ayce
        sushi places in California and I have never had a $30 acye which
        included the carpaccio, sea urchin, oyster, and even ikura. The sushi to
        rice ratio was perfect (rice was smaller). The appetizer “the shit” was
        the bomb. The hand rolls were full of fish. The yakitori? Or skewers
        were smalled and perfect in size so as you were able tot aste everything
        without getting too full. This was the first time we were ever reach the
        limit of 80 minutes and had to be timed out. That says a lot! The
        service was fast so ordering was not an issue.
