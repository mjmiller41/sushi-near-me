        Best sushi I've had in Vermont! Cute location, server was very
        attentive. Good quality for the price. My biggest concern was the amount
        of unused space, I wonder if being open as a bar/lounge or even having
        some relaxed music performances in the back could get more people in?
        The location has a lot of potential if used right.

        I ordered the Sushi picked by the chef, scallop roll, and a beer. The
        service was good considering there was one server in the restaurant at
        the time. I really enjoyed the scallop roll and tuna roll.

        We were curious to try Sushi Maeda as we have walked past and looked in
        but each time we have been there seemed to be a long wait of 30+
        minutes. Finally we went around 5:00 pm and were able to get a seat. We
        eat largely plant based and wanted to try the vegetable sushi. We
        ordered green tea to start which was excellent (and we have green
        often). We also got Daikon Dengaku which was a soft and warm almost
        potato like consistency with an incredible sweet and gooey miso sauce on
        top that was like nothing we have ever eaten before but was incredible.
        We also ordered three different vegetable sushis: Shitake, Kanpyo (white
        gourd), and Shiba Zuke Shiso (pickle mixture). I was pleasantly
        surprised by the individual quality of each piece of sushi. One slight
        critique was how small they were (felt just less an inch in diameter)
        and there were only 6 of each kind. I realize many probably go to get an
        entree which would have more food but we just wanted sushi. All in all
        the quality was excellent and the restaurant has a sort of upscale vibe
        with restrained staff. Personally I will be getting sushi from other
        sources going forward just because I tend to want larger portions but
        this is a great spot to try if you are craving great authentic Japanese
        style sushi.

        We walked in on the Friday before Christmas and there was one person at
        the bar and a couple at a table. We proceeded to wait at the host
        station for a few minutes while the server talked with the couple. I
        decided to go to the bathroom while we waited. When I got out of the
        bathroom, the server was still talking to the couple and my husband was
        still waiting at the host station. The server was facing the door the
        whole time, so plenty of opportunity to stop her personal conversation
        and at least greet us at any time.


        We then decided to sit at the bar where she handed us menus. Several
        minutes went by before she took our simple order of a half bottle of
        sake and 3 sushi rolls. Nothing too elaborate. As we waited for our
        sake,  my husband went to the bathroom. When he returned, he mentioned
        that someone was in the other stall watching sports news on his phone.
        Pretty odd. A few minutes after we got our sake, an older man slowly
        moved from the bathroom to the open kitchen area... clearly the man
        watching sports in the bathroom. He walked into the sushi bar area of
        the open kitchen and washed his hands. I guess that's a plus.


        It was around this time that the couple and the man at the bar finished
        their patronage and left independently of each other. We were the only
        ones in the entire place. We proceeded to sit at the bar for another 35
        minutes without seeing the waitress or any food, with the old man behind
        the sushi bar just shuffling around in slow motion. It was too far away
        to know if he was making our food or not. At this point, we got up,
        threw some cash on the bar for the sake we had consumed, and walked out.


        Three Sushi Rolls should never take more than 15 minutes. We were there
        for the better part of an hour. I DO NOT recommend this place. Hard
        pass...

        The sushi and service were spectacular. Fish selection was great. Every
        single bite I had from the Special Sushi Sampler was different and
        packed with great flavors. The portion sizes of the fish were a little
        too generous compared to the rice but in the end it was a great bonus.
        It showed off the freshness and quality of the cuts they use. The
        service staff were very attentive the moment we walked through the doors
        and worked very hard to deliver a great meal service.
