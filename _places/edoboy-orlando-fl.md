        Fun experience with nice quality rice and fish. Did the baller set for a
        change of pace. Staff was amazing and Asia made us a really great list
        of her favorite restaurants in the area!

        This is the best sushi I’ve ever had and one of the best meals I’ve ever
        had. I was able to snag a single person reservation after wanting to try
        this place for so long and the standing set up makes it comfortable for
        a solo date. The fish is noticeably fresh and high quality and so
        delicious. I don’t usually opt for hand rolls but the hand rolls here
        changed my mind, the akami-toro was so good I ordered a second one. I’m
        not normally crazy about miso soup either but again, theirs was the best
        I’ve ever had and the perfect ending to an amazing meal. I can’t wait to
        come back and try everything I didn’t get the first time. Half of the
        people in my time slot were regulars that come almost on a weekly basis
        and I truly understand why.

        If you haven’t been to Edoboy, let me tell you—you’re missing out on one
        of the most incredible dining experiences in Orlando. This isn't just
        sushi; this is an art form, and every bite is crafted with precision,
        passion, and a level of care that makes you feel like you're in the home
        of a master chef who just so happens to treat you like family.


        At first, it’s just you, a few strangers, and a sushi counter—but by the
        end of the night, you’re raising your sake glasses with newfound
        friends, marveling at how food can bring people together in such a
        powerful way.


        The service? Flawless. You never have to ask for anything because the
        team at Edoboy is already two steps ahead. They move with a quiet
        elegance, ensuring every moment flows seamlessly—whether it’s refilling
        your sake, offering the next handcrafted masterpiece, or simply sharing
        a warm smile that makes you feel at home.


        And the sushi? Unreal. Each piece is a symphony of flavors—delicate yet
        rich, simple yet profound. The kind of food that makes you pause, close
        your eyes, and just exist in that perfect bite.


        Edoboy isn’t just a restaurant—it’s an experience. It’s a place where
        the world slows down, where the warmth of good company and great food
        wraps around you like a comforting embrace. It’s proof that sometimes,
        the best meals aren’t just about what’s on the plate but about the
        people you share them with.


        Orlando, we are lucky to have a spot like this. Run, don’t walk—just be
        ready to leave with a full heart, a happy stomach, and maybe even a few
        new friends.

        GREAT, and Asia was the best Host!!! Let me tell you something, if you
        haven't been here.... GOOOOOOO!!! It's standing only and you have to

        So to start, it took some effort to finally get this reservation, as
        they have very limited seating and only open reservations for one week
        at a time (and we can only do nights on the weekend) parking was
        plentiful, which can’t be said for most places on mills. So we showed up
        a few minutes early, but the kitchen was running a little behind so we
        started about 20 minutes late. This was ok because they offered drinks
        while we were waiting outside. Once inside we had a nice concierge
        experience. The decor was fairly minimalist and nice. We chose the chefs
        “baller” chefs tasting set. Each course was amazing, and we loved it.
        Some of the courses were of the best sushi we’ve had in a long time. We
        feel this venue is deserving of their bib gourmand status with Michelin.
        Service was excellent. Only downside is that I would prefer a pacing
        that is a little slower, maybe if they slowed it down to an hour and a
        half instead of one hour, it would work out much better. Currently it
        feels a little rushed. We do appreciate the intimate environment, and we
        don’t mind the standing aspect of it, as many excellent sushi venues in
        Tokyo are standing only. Overall, we recommend this restaurant, and we
        will be returning in the future.
