        This was a fun experience with sushi going by on a conveyor belt on
        little plates. You pick what you want. The sushi was fresh and
        flavorful. Most flavorful sushi was on the red plates. Gives you a
        chance to try a lot of different kinds of sushi. Four pieces of sushi
        per plate, so you can share. The only thing is that the dishes are not
        labeled, so for us being new to this, it was a bit difficult for us to
        tell which sushi we were trying so we could remember for the future. We
        tried to match what we picked to the pictures in the menu, but we
        weren't always right. The server was able to tell us the name after we
        picked. We will definitely come here again. It is close to an EV charger
        in the Fred Meyer parking lot. We had mostly red plates, which are the
        most expensive, and still ate there very reasonably.

        I loved Sushi Island! The sushi rolls were delicious! They all looked so
        beautiful, so it was difficult to know which ones to choose! It was very
        fun to do the conveyer belt thing, and I would highly recommend it for a
        fun get together. The service was also very friendly and helpful.

        First time here. Really enjoyed the sashimi platter. The rotating belt
        of different sushi was pretty cool too. Haven’t seen that anywhere.
        Overall this place was very enjoyable. Can’t leave out the miso soup. 
        Tons of flavor just like the sushi. And for the price, I don’t think you
        can beat it. Give them a try if you haven’t been here! Hope you enjoy it
        as much as I did.

        If you’re looking for a place to enjoy sushi in a more casual setting,
        this restaurant might be worth a visit. The owner doesn’t have a deep
        understanding of sushi, so don’t expect high-quality sushi here.
        However, if you’re just looking to have a California roll or similar
        types of sushi, it should be fine.

        In terms of traditional sushi, the rice is too sticky and resembles
        mochi, and the texture and freshness of the fish aren’t great. The
        tempura also reflects a lack of understanding of Japanese cuisine. The
        miso soup is made from an instant packet.

        I wouldn’t recommend this place to those who have a good understanding
        of Japanese sushi or tempura. I don’t plan to visit this place again.

        It was fine. My kids aren't picky on sushi at all and there was a couple
        pieces that they wouldn't finish. There was also a lot of spicy sauce on
        stuff. Which is fine but some people just don't love everything spicy.
        We couldn't get the waitress to come refill my sons cup. We also went at
        lunch when it was busy and the conveyor was not getting refilled very
        quickly. I am not sure we will be back.
