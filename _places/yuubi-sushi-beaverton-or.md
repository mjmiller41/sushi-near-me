        Such a great spot for authentic sushi.  The service was truly
        outstanding.  The selection of fish is somewhat limited but the quality
        is very good.  Presentation is far better than nearly all of the
        restaurants in PDX.  Hand roll ingredients were well balanced and
        proportionate… the salmon skin hand roll was exceptional.

        I randomly popped in for a solo sushi dinner and was blown away! As a
        solo diner, I got seated right away at the sushi bar (which felt lucky,
        since it sounds like there’s typically a wait) but after the dining
        experience, I gladly would have waited!


        The service was exceptional and the chef’s know what they’re doing with
        the sushi — everything was phenomenal —my only complaint was that I wish
        I had a second stomach so I could have tried more of the menu! I got a
        few hand rolls, spicy tuna inari (incredible) and special salmon nigiri
        — the sushi rice was already seasoned, so no soy sauce necessary. The
        quality of the fish was excellent — best I’ve had in ages.


        Thank you for a wonderful experience, I can’t wait to come back!

      text: "A Hidden Gem for Sushi Lovers!\n\nThis was my first visit to the Portland area, and I was really hoping to find some fresh seafood. After searching around Beaverton and Hillsboro without much luck, I finally came across Yuubi Sushi—and I’m so glad I did!\n\nWhen we arrived, I noticed the restaurant was on the smaller side, with only three or four parking spaces on the side. Luckily, there was additional street parking just a few steps away. Inside, it’s a cozy and immaculately clean spot with just nine tables and two sushi rollers working behind the counter. We got there around 5:30, and aside from one other couple, we had the place almost to ourselves.\n\nThe service was fantastic—two young women with big smiles, wonderful attitudes, and top-notch professionalism. They were polite, helpful, and honestly, just fun to interact with. Right away, they made sure we had everything we needed and even customized all of our rolls with soy paper instead of nori for my dining companion.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the food—because it was next-level:\n•\tHon Maguro (Dry-Aged Japanese Bluefin Tuna) – Insanely fresh, melt-in-your-mouth, and just high-quality perfection.\n•\tHamachi (Yellowtail from Japan) – Excellent. Two pieces for $20, and worth every penny.\n•\tCrazy Boss Roll – A beer-battered tempura shrimp roll topped with spicy tuna, eel sauce, and spicy mayo. Fantastic.\n•\tSpidey Roll – Another tempura-battered roll, this time with soft-shell crab. Absolutely delicious.\n•\tMiso Soup – Perfectly comforting on a cold evening.\n•\tTruffle Tuna Roll – I don’t remember the exact name, but wow—fresh, flavorful, and an absolute must-try.\n\nOverall, this was an amazing experience. I’d absolutely bring my group of chefs here for the super fresh tuna and incredible service. Yuubi Sushi is truly a hidden gem, and it makes me wish I was a local!\n\n5/5 – Highly recommend!"

        Yuubi Sushi is a standout spot for anyone who loves exceptional sushi!
        From the warm ambiance to the impeccable service, everything about this
        place makes it a must-visit.


        The shrimp sashimi was a showstopper-it was unbelievably fresh, with a
        sweetness and buttery texture that practically melted in my mouth. It
        was easily one of the best sashimi experiences l've ever had. The
        Sashimi Set was another highlight, offering a beautifully arranged
        selection of fresh fish that was both visually stunning and packed with
        flavor. Each piece was so tender and perfectly balanced.


        Their rolls are equally impressive. The San Francisco Roll was light and
        refreshing, the Scott Roll had an incredible depth of flavor with its
        unique combination of ingredients, and the Niner Roll added a spicy kick
        that made it absolutelv irresistible.


        Yuubi Sushi goes above and beyond with their attention to detail and the
        quality of their dishes. If you're in Beaverton and craving top-tier
        sushi, this place is a must-try. I can't wait to return for another
        incredible meal!

        Yubbi Sushi offers some of the best sushi around extremely fresh and
        absolutely delicious! The staff is incredibly friendly and goes out of
        their way to make you feel welcome. The only downside is the space; it’s
        quite small, so it can feel a bit cramped. Also, the prices are on the
        higher side, but with quality this good, it’s worth it for a special
        treat.
