        We came around 7:45. Everything was great but unfortunately 20 minutes
        before close time vacuum cleaners and knocking around cleaning up.
        Taking ice cream before restaurant closed was very disappointing. All
        around food was great but I think they should be more mindful of their
        customers during closing times!

        Omaha! How does this buffet have 4 stars? The food was horrible. I
        grabbed my usuals, spicy chicken dishes… it tasted old, like old food
        AND it was not fresh or crispy. Not all the chicken tasted old but none
        of it was good. Onto the seafood… crab was mostly fake, which I expect
        from buffets but I keep it to a minimum, like in sushi… which was awful.
        The coconut shrimp was pretty good but when you coat something in sugar,
        it helps. The best thing on the buffet besides ice cream was the bacon
        shrimp. The beef was slimy and the pork ribs were way overcooked.


        The hibachi grill looked too scary to try. The meat was browning due to
        temperature issues and I didn’t want late night visits to the ER. I am
        already expecting multiple bathroom trips.


        The service… bland or as the kids say these days… it was mid.


        The place was fairly clean so that helped keep me from walking right
        out.


        Honestly Omaha, you have better Chinese cuisine… save yourself from
        heartache.

        It was my first time at a Chinese Buffet and I was pleasantly
        surprised!! We went on a very busy Friday night. Everything seemed fresh
        and items were frequently being replenished/replaced. Given this is a
        buffet, I expected worse quality of food but honestly half the stuff
        wasn't bad and I actually thoroughly enjoyed it!


        I will definitely be coming back here, specifically for the these
        dishes: Coconut Shrimp (it's like a honey walnut shrimp without the
        nuts. It was SO SO good. Like restaurant quality.), hot and sour soup
        (LOVED this soup. It had those long stringy mushrooms in it and was
        delicious), and crab rangoons.


        I personally did not enjoy the salmon, some of the desserts, the
        general's chicken (it was dark meat), and some various other things I
        tried, but honestly this is a really decent buffet. I'm excited to go
        back. I highly recommend it.

        Several employees eating while working. Went up to the hibachi grill.
        Cook is sitting on a bucket eating playing on his phone. He sees people
        waiting for him to cook he comes over rinses is hand with water NO SOAP!
        Takes their food uses his hands to push food off the plate onto stove
        top.

        Our server was eating next to us would stop eating to get our plates and
        dump them and then continued to eat.

        Several on their phones while working which I don’t care but phones are
        so full of bacteria.

        Food is okay not great. Very Americanized taste.

        Very good food with a wide selection of dishes. Tasty and hot. The place
        is kept clean with staff cleaning tables as they were vacated. Picked up
        our empty dishes quickly and all smiles around. I'll definitely come
        back. Lunch is 9.99 until 3
