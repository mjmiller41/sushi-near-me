        Food was "okay"! Lots of choices. Better if you like seafood, clams
        oysters squid fish shrimp. Good choices of desserts, not much salad
        choices. Most dishes not marked so hard to know what it is. Food not
        hot.

        Staff friendly and helpful.

        Well, I'm still searching for my favorite Chinese buffet in Antioch.
        This one left a lot to be desired.

        #1) service was ok but there was the fact I waited the whole meal to see
        my server one time. They brought my sweet tea with like 3 ice cubes in
        it so it was warm-cool at best lol waited the whole meal for a refill
        without seeing the waitress.

        #2) the food offered is a very wide variety from seafood to hibachi to
        fried foods to stir fried foods to sushi. However this is one of those
        situations where you'd rather a restaurant pick 2 or 3 things and excel
        at those three things instead of serving everything and none of them are
        any good...

        The hibachi ingredients seemed fresh and well stocked. However I'm not a
        big fan of hibachi, so I didn't order any. However, if you like hibachi
        it seems like this may be one spot you happen to like.

        The fried foods were OK but mostly stale or burnt and we went at lunch
        time. I'm including a picture of some chicken on a stick I wanted to try
        but it was no good.

        The fried chicken pieces with sweet n sour sauce was the only thing my
        husband found to enjoy.

        I liked the fried rice and some veggie options. I got along ok with the
        desserts that were offered but I noticed several things: the ice cream
        spoon cleaning sink was barely running and looked like it hadn't been
        cleaned all day. They didn't have bowls by the ice cream so people were
        stuffing sauce cups with ice cream and it was getting messy.

        The sushi was ok looking and I might have partaken if the Wasabi had
        looked freshly prepared instead of in it's separating state. The fried
        sushi was so stale it was gross I had to spit it out. I realized why
        when I rounded the corner and saw 5 whole rolls of fried sushi sitting
        in a bowl on top of ice. Not freshly prepared. 🤢

        #3) The floors and lower walls were dirty, chairs sticky and the
        bathrooms needed attention. We will not be back to this buffet.

        When we checked out the lady at the register did not even ask how our
        meal was or conversate. 😒 sorely disappointed.

        I recently visited Dynasty Buffet, and while my experience had some
        positives, it also left room for improvement. The standout aspect of
        this restaurant was the service—absolutely amazing! The staff was
        attentive, friendly, and quick to assist with anything we needed. Their
        professionalism and hospitality definitely elevated the visit. The
        prices were also very reasonable, making it a budget-friendly dining
        option.


        However, the food quality did not quite match the excellent service.
        Many of the dishes seemed slightly old and were served lukewarm rather
        than hot. While the variety of options was impressive, the lack of
        freshness detracted from the overall enjoyment of the meal. If the food
        had been served warm and tasted fresher, this buffet could easily have
        earned a 4.5-star rating.


        That said, Dynasty Buffet has the potential to be a fantastic spot with
        just a little more focus on maintaining food quality and temperature.
        I’d still recommend it for those looking for affordable dining with
        excellent service, but I’d advise going during peak hours to increase
        the chances of fresher food. With a few improvements, this restaurant
        could truly stand out. For now, I’d rate it 3.5 out of 5 stars.

        Staff never even flinched! I used light on my phone, but they quickly
        had lantern by the food. Service, as always, was great and food was hot.
        I will definitely go back.
