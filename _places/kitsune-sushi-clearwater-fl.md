        WOW!

        Great decor, atmosphere and vibes.

        Very friendly staff everything was fresh and delicious, not a super long
        wait to be sat and served.

        It really was great, everything was enjoyable. My fiancee and her son
        are picky eaters so they are reluctant to try new places but they both
        loved it! We will all definitely be back.

        WOW!

        Great decor, atmosphere and vibes.

        Very friendly staff everything was fresh and delicious, not a super long
        wait to be sat and served.

        It really was great, everything was enjoyable. My fiancee and her son
        are picky eaters so they are reluctant to try new places but they both
        loved it! We will all definitely be back.

        We went on a Saturday at 3:30 pm our experience is as follows,


        Atmosphere: bright, modern, comfy booths


        Price: I posted a picture of the receipt for you to judge the price, I
        think it was fairly priced because it was so good and creative!!


        Service: 4/5 they were good and friendly :)


        Food: very Americanized in the best way. This place has the most diverse
        rolls and so many options. Good portions and ratio. The pork bao was
        good although a little shy on portions.


        Will be coming back to try noodles!!

        Love it here. Been coming since 2024. Consistent, cannot complain about
        the ambiance, service and menu! The service is great when you dine in
        and when you place to go orders. Well packaged and not stingy with
        portions and sides. Our favorite go to is the spicy miso ramen, yellow
        tail sashimi and the US 19 roll.Btw you can substitute ingredients, we
        always order sushi without cream cheese and they offer gluten free soy
        sauce and in general, they cater to people with allergies as well. We
        always make room for dessert too, love the fried ice cream and we tried
        all flavors.


        Kitsune is so clean and definitely great place for families, date nights
        and they play great music. We always leave full and extremely satisfied.
        Thank you!!!

        Better than expected. knew this would be good but didn't expect such
        great interior design and multiple kitsunes. The mural because the sushi
        makers seems beautiful. They have beautiful art and decor on the inside.

        I had sashimi which was very good 👍as well as the salad my partner did
        not desire and the clear soup both were delicious; and a pork katsu. For
        me personally it was a bit too thin and crunchy but that's just me.

        My partner on the other hand has a spicy tonkatsu ramen with pork belly
        and he really liked it. To the point I was not able to capture before he
        dove into his meal.


        Will come back to try the other options as they also have hibachi,
        rolls, udon and various other sides and starters I would like to try


        The miso was the only thing not up to par from previous experiences. Not
        enough tofu.

        What a great find this place was! I saw it while I was in the area
        around lunch time and decided to give it a try. It's beautifully
        decorated extremely comfortable atmosphere.


        Jonelyn was my server and she was so friendly, so sweet with an ever
        present beautiful smile! I had a few questions about some of the menu
        items and she patiently explained them to me. I had a miso soup which
        was hot fresh and delicious. I then decided to be a little adventurous
        although it didn't sound very appetizing and tried the octopus balls
        appetizer. Before you pass judgement..haha.. with the help of Google I
        confirmed that octopus do not have balls! This dish is chopped up
        octopus meat and other seasonings formed into a ball with dough and
        lightly fried with a very delicious sauce. They were absolutely
        fantastic! Don't let the name turn you off.


        Next I had a volcano sushi roll. Presentation was outstanding and the
        flavor was fantastic! Anyone that has eaten Sushi before knows at first
        bite how fresh the fish and other ingredients are. I knew right away the
        ingredients were all Super fresh and again very delicious!


        I will return to try other things on their menu as there were so many
        options that both sounded and looked great! Overall rating for Kitsuné
        10 out of 10. A must try for all!
