        THIS PLACE IS THE MOST UNDERRATED RAMEN RESTAURANT IN ALL OF CHICAGO!!!


        Where do I even start.

        This is by far one of the best ramen places in all of Chicago. When we
        entered the restaurant, we were greeted immediately. We were asked where
        we wanted to sit. We chose where we wanted to sit and then scanned the
        menu. It was an immediate choice for me and my guest. I got the Tonkotsu
        ramen and my guest had the teriyaki salmon. The ramen was AMAZING. It
        was creamy and delicious. The egg was subpar. And the teriyaki was
        great. The salad was delightful. The dressing was perfect.

        The service was impeccable. The woman who served us was soo nice and
        brought us our food and drink fast.

        Last of all, the atmosphere was great. It felt  subdued and quiet,
        therefore;it is a perfect place to chill out with friends or family. 
        The music was great and smooth and mellow.


        P.s. it is very cheap, the whole meal + 2 sprites was 40$.


        Definitely A 10/10 THIS IS A MUST

        Nano is my favorite place in the city for sushi! Linda the owner is so
        so kind and welcoming, and the food is both affordable and delicious.
        (It’s rare that I like both the sushi and the ramen at the same place!)


        The vibe is very relaxed; sometimes I come with my kindle and just eat a
        few rolls and hang out. Other times I’ve brought a friend for a 1:1
        catchup, and I even had my birthday party here in November ‘24, which
        was a blast!


        Nano is my special place in Chicago and I hope it can be yours too!

        I recently visited Nano Sushi, and it was an incredible experience! The
        Mini Gozila Roll was out of this world—easily one of the best sushi
        rolls I’ve ever had. The flavors were perfectly balanced, and it was as
        delicious as it was creative.


        Linda, our server, made the entire dining experience even more memorable
        with her outstanding service. She was attentive, friendly, and really
        made us feel welcome. Overall, I would highly recommend Nano Sushi for
        anyone looking for top-tier sushi and excellent customer service.
        Definitely worth a visit!
