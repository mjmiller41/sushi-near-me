        I can't give this place a good enough review! Excellent sushi is
        something that people in rural Illinois have to travel a long way to
        find, so it's a rare treat. If I had known this place was open 2 years
        ago, it would have been a monthly stop.


        We got the Rock Shrimp appetizer, Shrimp and Filet Mignon hibachi plate,
        a Saki cooked roll (keep forgetting the name, but it's on the first
        sushi page in the menu), the Super Man roll, and the House Fried Rice.
        All of it was so good that I forgot to take more photos. We ordered a
        Wow roll and an Angry Dragon roll to go.


        Everything was fantastic! The tempura breading was light and crunchy,
        all of the fish, chicken, and meat were tender and fresh, the veggies
        were nicely sauteed but still had a snap, and the sauces were flavorful
        but not overpowering. Each of the sushi rolls was masterfully crafted,
        and held together well enough that I could use a fork to pick them up.
        The House Fried Rice included chicken, steak, and shrimp, and they
        cooked the steak to my preference of medium rare. The teriyaki sauce was
        authentic in flavor and texture, and not mostly comprised of sugar.


        Our server was excellent, and went above and beyond what I would
        normally expect. She regularly checked on us even when it got busy,
        genuinely asked us for feedback, and indulged my curiosity (I asked how
        long the business had been open, and about the little charms and
        bracelets they sell - which she makes herself).


        The restaurant itself is quaint but spacious, well lit, decorated
        tastefully, and comfortable. The bench seats weren't too hard, nor did I
        sink into them to the extent that I struggled to hold my head above the
        table. The sushi bar is in the front of the house, so it is possible to
        watch the chef work.


        The only possible criticism I can give is that they don't have fountain
        drinks, but they had a great selection of canned  sodas served with cups
        of ice and straws, as well as red or white wine and both hot and cold
        sake.


        Overall, this sushi and hibachi restaurant is a gem not only for Morris,
        but for all of Central Illinois! You made my birthday dinner memorable.
        Thank you!

        I can't give this place a good enough review! Excellent sushi is
        something that people in rural Illinois have to travel a long way to
        find, so it's a rare treat. If I had known this place was open 2 years
        ago, it would have been a monthly stop.


        We got the Rock Shrimp appetizer, Shrimp and Filet Mignon hibachi plate,
        a Saki cooked roll (keep forgetting the name, but it's on the first
        sushi page in the menu), the Super Man roll, and the House Fried Rice.
        All of it was so good that I forgot to take more photos. We ordered a
        Wow roll and an Angry Dragon roll to go.

        Me and my friends go here a lot and it’s always excellent! Great food,
        great service, the dishes themselves are adorable, and I love the music.
        Me and some friends went here for a birthday and they brought out a
        cheesecake without us asking for it which was very nice! As we were
        leaving our server stopped off and offered some cute little flower
        bouquet trinkets for each of us. Definitely recommended!

        Went there with my family and we ordered hibachi and sushi. Very yummy
        and worth the  trip there. I got cooked and raw sushi and both were full
        of flavor with a great sauce. The hibachi steak melts in your mouth. I
        would definitely go back. The service was great too. Very kind and sweet
        people who work there.

        This was our first time here but also my first time eating sushi being
        gluten free. The waitress was so kind and understanding about it and
        gave suggestions to make rolls that would've had gluten, gluten free!
        She even warned me about the soy sauce and brought out more spicy mayo
        for me to dip in. The food was delicious! Best of all, I had no reaction
        to gluten so I appreciate the due diligence and my allergy taken
        seriously. My son loved his shrimp hibachi. They even gave him a toy to
        go! When we are in town, we will definitely come back.

        Super delicious good quality food here. Got the hibachi shrimp and they
        were very accommodating giving me extra veggies instead of rice since
        I’m currently low-carb. Prices were reasonable, everything I ordered was
        awesome! Lady the counter was super friendly and helpful. Really cute
        atmosphere inside, just totally adorable. Definitely plan on coming back
        whenever. I’m in the area.
