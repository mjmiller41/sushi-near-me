        I just saw the guy making the food grab the noddles he was going to cook
        with his bare hands. The make their own siracha sauce and it taste
        molded and horrible. When I asked if I can have some of the real
        sriracha they had on the table they said they only use it for sushi. I
        got the sushi and was still denied the sriracha.

        I just saw the guy making the food grab the noddles he was going to cook
        with his bare hands. The make their own siracha sauce and it taste
        molded and horrible. When I asked if I can have some of the real
        sriracha they had on the table they said they only use it for sushi. I
        got the sushi and was still denied the sriracha.

        Terrible experience.  They gave me a salmon poke bowl instead of tuna
        and completely missed the dumplings.  By the time we got our food home
        and realized the mistake, they were already closed so I called the next
        day.  I had to argue with the guy for a while before he gave in and said
        I had to bring back the poke bowl.  I don’t like raw salmon so I legit
        brought back the bowl with their undercooked rice and the salmon from
        the night before.  They replaced the dumplings and a tuna poke bowl, but
        the tuna so old and fishy-smelling I had to throw the whole thing away. 
        They knew what they were doing too and wouldn’t even look me in the eye
        when they handed me the food.


        Difficult to work with, and dishonest.  Stay far away from this place!

        Don’t know what kind of meat they’re selling but it ain’t right. Just
        disgusting, waste of money. When you walk in the amount of customers you
        see inside will show you how terrible the food is. Nothing fresh

        Dirty, trash covered counter and sticky floors with spills everywhere.
        Food pre-cooked and sitting on the grill when it's dead inside. If I had
        another choice for sushi, I'd be there already.


        Customer service is horrid. They seem to just not care about who came in
        first and will serve orders as they see fit. Ex: I'm 21, but theyve
        served 25 and I'm still waiting.


        Update: they reached order 30 before 21 was served. When I asked for
        sauce they had the audacity to say "50c each". No apology, no care.


        Seems like their sushi chef struggles to just make a roll.


        This place makes me regret even liking sushi to begin with.

        So before I went here I was told that it’s very similar in quality to
        something you would get at the mall. With those expectations I was
        pleasantly surprised at it being good. The steak didn’t taste cheap and
        the chicken wasn’t slimy. The teriyaki sauce they put on top was a good
        flavor and not too salty. And it is very cheap for the portions. Can’t
        eat this super often but I’d get it again.
