        My co-workers and I tried this place for the first time today since they
        had all you can eat sushi. I’m not a sushi person so I had hibachi
        chicken and vegetables and it was pretty good. The table had a large
        variety of rolls and they all enjoyed them. Consensus was that at an
        affordable price it was definitely worth the money. I’m sure we’d come
        back again.

        Nice place to get fresh sushi.  Our waitress was very nice and
        attentive.

        We arrived just at 5 pm, so the place was pretty empty. Tables and
        booths were clean.  Did not use the restroom, so I can not comment on
        that.

        We ordered a sushi boat for 2, spicy edamme,  two custom rolls, and miso
        soup.  This was all for the 4 of us.  It was the perfect amount.  Rolls
        were made with not so much rice as other sushi restaurants we have been
        to.  Because of that, we were able to taste all the yummy fish and other
        fillings in the roll.


        This restaurant is overall a good place to go and have some fresh sushi.

        I went here for lunch on a whim and it was the perfect place. The chef
        here is amazing. The summer roll is filling, crispy and with the right
        amount of spice that balances the roll. Beautiful plating as well. The
        Salmon Hibachi is a wonderful medley of flavors. Best Miso soup ever.
        And yes, people can mess it up. Not here. Yummy.


        When I am on the borderline of hangry descent, I really cannot have
        anything that I do not like. I walked in in that hangry daze and
        anything off would have just been horrific. It was wonderful! I am very
        happy I stopped in. I left relaxed, clear headed and with a new go-to
        place for sushi.


        The space feels expansive, warm and welcoming inside. I would definitely
        recommend for any occasion. The parking in the area is always tight, but
        this is worth it. It would be great for small or mid-sized large parties
        as well.


        The wait staff is responsive and quick.


        I wholeheartedly recommend!
