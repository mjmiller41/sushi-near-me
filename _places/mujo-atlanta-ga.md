        A beautifully crafted progressive meal service.


        It was an inspiring experience. Every bite was delicately prepared right
        in front of us and it’s evident there was a lot of thought placed into
        every single bite.


        Service was detail oriented; I loved that they picked up on me being
        left handed and adjusted their service accordingly.


        The venue is lovely. It’s a joy to sit in front of the chefs and get to
        chat with them about the quality of the food.


        There is valet parking ($10).


        I will say that my only quarrel was with the pricing. I truly value the
        fresh ingredients that are flown in to provide a quality product and the
        experienced chefs that have dedicated themselves to the craft, but they
        could have added 2 more bites to the meal. Would have been perfect
        amount. We did the omakase and ended up adding on a couple things to be
        properly full. I would’ve loved to just get full off the omakase alone
        and not have to fuss with additional things.


        Special shout out to the ice cream! Superb combination!

        A beautifully crafted progressive meal service.


        It was an inspiring experience. Every bite was delicately prepared right
        in front of us and it’s evident there was a lot of thought placed into
        every single bite.


        Service was detail oriented; I loved that they picked up on me being
        left handed and adjusted their service accordingly.


        The venue is lovely. It’s a joy to sit in front of the chefs and get to
        chat with them about the quality of the food.


        There is valet parking ($10).


        I will say that my only quarrel was with the pricing. I truly value the
        fresh ingredients that are flown in to provide a quality product and the
        experienced chefs that have dedicated themselves to the craft, but they
        could have added 2 more bites to the meal. Would have been perfect
        amount. We did the omakase and ended up adding on a couple things to be
        properly full. I would’ve loved to just get full off the omakase alone
        and not have to fuss with additional things.

        This was my first omakase experience, and Mujo seriously set the bar
        high. From start to finish, everything felt so intentional-the space,
        the service, the wine pairing, and of course, the food. Every dish was
        beautifully presented and full of flavor. We also added foie gras monaka
        (was unreal) and wagyu temaki


        The staff were amazing-so attentive and kind.

        They explained each wine pairing and any question we might have about
        the food. It really added to how special the night felt.


        Highly recommend for anyone looking to enjoy something unforgettable!
        It’s not just dinner, it’s a whole experience

        We did the private omakase room for 5 and the vibe was perfect. I know
        some Michelin star places that don't offer the private suite, so that
        was nice. Had a really great time. Really good drinks. Really fresh
        sushi. Great experience. Really attentive and knowledgeable chef.

        Mujō was my second omakase ever, a couple months after returning from
        Japan and my first omakase experience in Miyazaki.


        I was blown away from the moment I approached the door and a couple
        staff members welcomed me in. The ambiance was so enjoyable. Elevated,
        elegant, and sophisticated, without being pretentious. This was greatly
        in part to the entire staff’s overwhelming kindness, and the incredible
        playlist (which I learned later was the work of Chef Harris).


        Of course I cannot speak enough of the menu. Every course from the
        omakase was delicious from start to finish.


        To highlight a few, the Japanese egg custard was perfect and always
        feels like a comforting hug. The richness of the egg paired nicely with
        the earthy morel, bright green onions, and umami rich gin-an. The
        bluenose stood out to me, this was my first time experiencing it;
        delicate, buttery, but still light and sweet. Miso soup was well timed
        at the end of the meal, and was a delicious and welcome palate cleanser
        after so much incredible nigiri.


        I cannot end this review without mentioning the dessert. Roasted sesame
        ice cream, with a miso rum caramel, fried pieces of Japanese sweet
        potato, and pieces of puffed rice. Fantastic.

        One of the best dinning experiences I have had. The food was fresh and
        delicious. I can not wait to come back. Service was impeccable.


        If you get the beverage pairing, get ready for story time, it was super
        informative and I found it entertaining. We added Wagyu Temaki Beef
        Tataki, Caviar Service and I LOVED the Foie Gras Monaka!!!!!!

        But let me tell you the bestest thing and personal favorite was THE
        DESSERT, OBSESSED. It was an overall spectacular evening. Thank you all
        so much! It was amazing :) oh and they have heated toilet seats 😅


        So I accidentally went to the place

        next door, so don’t make my mistake.

        I recommend the restaurant next door

        ask you if you had reservations at Mujō.


        Thank you all again!
