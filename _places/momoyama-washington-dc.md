        Complete authenticity. The people running this place are super sweet and
        always want you to leave happy. The sushi was the best I've had in a
        while. Highly recommend the Avocado Salmon Roll to start. The ramen was
        pretty spicy, but there is a mild option. If you are iffy on spice,
        definitely get the mild ramen. Overall the meal was affordable and
        delicious :)

        The place was small, cute, and charming. True mom and pop shop, the
        owners were so kind and doting. Tried the Bibimbap bowl and the mint
        lemonade and it did NOT disappoint. The owner and the cook herself, even
        mixed the Bibimbap for us. It felt like eating dinner at Grandma's
        house, and I can't wait to go back!

        Truly a nice small mom and pop shop. The bento boxes are filling and the
        flavors are good and not too intense. The pairing of the capers and red
        onion on the lightly cooked salmon makes for a delicious bite. If you’re
        in the area visiting the capitol or the botanical gardens I highly
        recommend stopping by

        Lovely little hole in the wall sushi/bento box place. Really satisfying
        meal. If you're hungry, get two sushi rolls or a box.

        My family of 5 was visiting DC and went to this place for a quick lunch.
        The space is small and we sat directly next (on same table as another
        group, which is no big deal, in a big city we are grateful to find
        seating) Each of us ordered either a roll, two or box. Food was good. My
        son quickly realized that he would like to order another roll and the
        owner said no and claimed they were out of rice which was clearly a lie.
        It was very awkward and, feeling uncomfortable, we figured let’s get out
        of there and asked for the check. In the following couple of minutes, we
        continued to realize that we were lied too because orders continued to
        be served, clearly including rice. After all it’s a sushi place. Check
        was about $60 and left 60 cents tip not appreciating being lied to. How
        much worth can service be? As soon as owner’s wife got a hold of the
        check while we are getting ready to leave, she began to appear upset,
        raised her voice in a foreign language and immediately began clearing
        the table while my wife and kids are still there, almost pushing them
        out of the way. Terrible and disrespectful service. Get your sushi
        elsewhere with good, honest service and decent space / atmosphere.
