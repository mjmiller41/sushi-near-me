        A delightful atmosphere and good selection! Everyone was super friendly
        and you could tell how much care was put into the food and service. We
        ate the squid and pork belly bulgogi and beef kimbap with hot tea - zero
        complaints. Would recommend if you're craving some good quality Korean
        cuisine.

        A delightful atmosphere and good selection! Everyone was super friendly
        and you could tell how much care was put into the food and service. We
        ate the squid and pork belly bulgogi and beef kimbap with hot tea - zero
        complaints. Would recommend if you're craving some good quality Korean
        cuisine.

        I had high hopes for Kim’s Bap Yeoubi, given the growing demand for
        authentic and high-quality Korean cuisine in the area. Unfortunately, my
        experience left me deeply disappointed, primarily due to the subpar
        quality of ingredients and the inconsistency in flavors.


        Let’s start with the Korean fried chicken—arguably the backbone of any
        respectable K-food establishment. The spicy sauce on the chicken was,
        without a doubt, the highlight of my meal. It had depth, heat, and the
        right balance of sweet and savory, coating the chicken beautifully.
        However, the soy garlic variant was a complete letdown. It lacked any
        discernible flavor, tasting like plain fried chicken with a hint of oil
        but none of the rich, umami-packed goodness expected from soy
        sauce-based Korean fried chicken.


        But what truly sealed my disappointment was the Katsu chicken and curry.
        The katsu was, quite frankly, abysmal. It was devoid of any seasoning,
        making each bite feel like a monotonous chore rather than an enjoyable
        experience. Katsu should be crisp on the outside, tender and juicy
        inside, with an addictive savory crunch. This, however, was dull, dry,
        and lifeless. To make matters worse, the curry was somehow even more
        flavorless. Curry should be rich, aromatic, and layered with spices that
        elevate the dish—this one tasted like it had simply been warmed up with
        zero attention to depth or complexity.


        The most frustrating part? The potential is there. The area is primed
        for an exceptional Korean restaurant to dominate the market. Instead,
        Kim’s Bap Yeoubi is squandering this golden opportunity by settling for
        cheap, low-quality chicken and poorly executed dishes. If you want to
        see what real Korean fried chicken should taste like, I strongly
        recommend heading to Bonchon Chicken in Troy, MI. Their chicken is
        leagues ahead—crispy, flavorful, and made with noticeably higher-quality
        ingredients.


        To the owners: this review isn’t meant to nitpick or tear your
        restaurant down. Instead, it’s a challenge. You are sitting on a prime
        opportunity to elevate Korean food in this area, yet you’re offering
        mediocre execution with uninspired ingredients. Please, take a step
        back, reassess your ingredient choices, and give customers a reason to
        return. A revamp of your recipes—starting with better chicken and
        properly seasoned dishes—could make this place the Korean food hotspot
        it deserves to be.


        Until then, I can’t recommend this place, especially when superior
        alternatives exist just a short drive away

        One of my coworkers brought me here for lunch on a Friday, around 1:30
        pm to avoid the lunch rush. It was tasty and the service was friendly.
        The food was fresh and made to order, so expect to wait a bit.


        Inside you'll first notice the neon accent lighting for the sign and
        display of Jinya ramen. It's a small and cute restaurant with soft jazzy
        music that is playing in their speakers and it is very much the perfect
        way to enjoy lunch whilst conversing about non-work life.


        The main entrée that I ordered was the Chef special (I think the first
        one), soondabu combo. I think because it was made fresh (and close to
        their closing time), the stew didn't quite have the time to thicken up,
        it was quite liquidy. I would say that it also didn't have as much tofu
        as other places make it, like Korea Palace, Chung Ki Wa, Daebak, or
        Soora. The combo tray came with a side of marinated pork and the usual
        von chon (sides) that you'd get at a Korean restaurant, such as kimchi
        and bean sprouts.


        I think next time I'll try the bibimbap, my other go to comfort food.
        They offered us a nice pot of jasmine tea with the meal, although cold
        water was also an option.


        I also ordered a vegetable gimbap (Korean version of sushi) to go and it
        was still moist and delicious hours later. I forgot to take a picture,
        but they used purple rice to make it as well. They were also very
        accommodating and wanted to let me know that they had egg in it, so it
        wasn't vegetarian. All good with my wife. Compared to H-Mart and Tiger
        Market, the rolls here appeared to be slightly bigger and the rice was
        softer. It does cost a bit more though.


        What I like most about this location is the proximity — no longer do us
        locals have to travel 25+ minutes for sit-down Korean food. At the same
        time, Kim's Bap is on the smaller end, so you wouldn't bring your whole
        family here. It's also on the higher price of what's offered as I'm not
        sure if any sides would come with the non-chef special entrées.
        Altogether, my lunch was $30 before tip.


        This location used to be a sushi joint that had jazzy live music on the
        weekends, but which closed during the quarantine. You may see that the
        large store sign outside at the top still references sushi. Hopefully
        this spot will be able to last too.

        Every time I visit here, it feels like being invited to a friend's
        place. Homey food & atmosphere. Friendly service. This time we had the
        daily special, which was spicy pork stew. Something you can't find at a
        typical Korean restaurant.
