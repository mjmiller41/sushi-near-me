        The only private omakase dining experience in Seattle! I was a bit
        nervous since I’m socially awkward, so anything 1 on 1 sounds daunting.
        Chef Saito is very warm and kind, and the food never stopped coming
        which made the experience less awkward than I had anticipated (can’t
        think too much when you’re stuffing your face). He’s a one-man show
        which really pulled at my heart strings; he’s clearly a hard worker and
        puts a lot of thought into his craft. What I loved that I haven’t seen
        other sushi places do is he writes out a very thorough menu for you to
        read alongside your meal. Not only does it list each course in order,
        but he also includes some cool facts or background of the course.
        Another thing I loved was that he has a sign in front of you that he
        flips after each course to tell you what’s up next. It just all felt
        very accessible and thoughtful to customers.


        In terms of the meal, you can tell Chef Saito means business! The moment
        we sat down, he had our first dish ready. Throughout the meal, we kept
        noticing fish or small dishes that we had never tried before or hadn’t
        known much about. If you read other reviews, other people noticed the
        same thing; Chef Saito picks unique things that you don’t see in other
        omakase restaurants. It was refreshing to see the different cuts,
        different regions the fish came from, and different preparation
        techniques he used for each dish. They were all delicious! I highly
        recommend pairing your meal with a houjicha tea he picked out from Japan
        and hands down the best houjicha I’ve ever had. Dessert was also very
        delicious - a homemade soft pudding with fruit and mochi ice cream.


        If you’re looking for a unique dining experience with a different range
        of omakase items, this is definitely worth the try! People know about
        the big hitters in Seattle like Taneda, LTD, Sushi Kashiba, etc, and I
        feel Sai is kind of this low-key hidden gem (opened in 2020 aka the
        worst time!) that most of Seattle still doesn’t really know about. I
        really hope Chef Saito gets more recognition, since he deserves it. He
        won’t be your chatty, super engaging chef, but he is so kind and will
        make sure your dining experience is meeting/exceeding your standards.
        I’d love to spread the word on him. We know we’ll definitely be back.

        I’ve tried all of omakase in Seattle, and this is by far the most
        intimate, and unique omakase experience. Chef Sai really differentiate
        his food by creating nigiris that you won’t find else where such as
        Kuruma-ebi, Hokke,  Geoduck and etc. if you’re tired or same ole omakase
        with same sets of fish, and wants to explore refreshing, and unique
        experience. This is the place to go

        Me and my friend spent a wonderful birthday event here. The food quality
        is very good and we were able to enjoy some uncommon nigiri ingredients
        that barely find on market. The akagai nigiri was probably the most
        superizing one! Chief is very professional and friendly, delivering very
        authentic dishes that he learned from the master in Japan. The whole
        place is not large and looked like only serve 4 people each time, but
        it's clean, it's quiet and comfortable to place all belongings and bags
        properly. Would definitely visit again!

        I loved how you can get an entirely private omakase experience at a
        similar price point to other popular high-end sushi places in Seattle.
        Sai’s hospitality is awesome, and I’d definitely recommend this place
        for special occasions.


        On a side note, this is a “one-man” restaurant, so Sai would not be at
        the bar at all times, as he has to handle all sorts of stuff to present
        a wonderful sushi experience.

        From start to finish, this omakase experience was very enjoyable . The
        chef’s attention to detail and mastery of flavors truly shone through in
        every course.


        The purple uni was a standout – its luxurious, buttery texture and briny
        sweetness was impressive. It melted on the palate like a dream. The toro
        was equally sublime, rich and fatty with the perfect balance of
        freshness. I also enjoy the nodoguro. The delicate, smoky flavor of this
        premium fish, paired with its silky texture, was simply unforgettable.


        The ambiance was intimate, and the chef’s passion for each ingredient
        was evident as they explained the origins and preparation behind every
        dish. If you’re a sushi lover, this is an absolute must-visit. I can’t
        wait to return for another round of culinary artistry!
