        What a hidden gem. Cheapest all you can eat sushi I’ve come across
        globally - with an extensive menu to choose from.

        Visiting from Aus and was fortunate enough to stumble across this place
        and it fulfilled my sushi needs. I just went with nigiri and all the
        seafood was fresh and tasted great with good serving of wasabi and
        ginger. Nice family owners - worth the visit esp after a full day of
        skiing.

        The Girl asked for all you can eat sushi for her graduation dinner and
        Sushi Yah made her dreams come true! The sushi rolls were so good! Some
        tempura some not but everything was excellent! And the price was
        awesome!!! My youngest LOVED the Gyoza and egg rolls. The rest of us
        tried just about EVERYTHING! Our favorites were the sunset, spicy
        crunch, Vegas, Eddy (the girl was really the only one who loved this but
        we all had fun trying it), Godzilla, Hurricane, and Utah Mountain. This
        made sitting through graduation worth it. Our waiter kept our glasses
        full and was great to explain or offer suggestions. This was really a
        great place!

        All you can eat sushi for an amazing price and the selection is vast!
        Most places exclude special rolls or you have to pay extra for them. Not
        this place! Every roll is amazing and we keep coming back for more. The
        bad reviews are from stingy Utah County folks who don't know good sushi
        at a great price.

        We went a little after 5 tonight. We were the only table the entire
        time. There was a carry out order. The gentlemen was a regular as he
        knew the staff and stopped by our table to recommend the miso soup to
        us. (And we’re glad he did!)


        We had several rolls and all of them were very good. Our least favorite
        was the Alaska roll, it was kinda bland to us. We love the Vegas roll!
        Other rolls we enjoyed were the Utah Mountain, Sunset, Hurricane and
        Crystal Crunch.


        The restaurant is a little antiquated as far as decor goes and someone
        needs to take a swiffer duster around. The sushi bar and tables were
        clean. The bathrooms need a bit of cleaning, but they weren’t the worst
        I’ve been in.


        The service was impeccable! The staff were very friendly, knowledgeable
        and accommodating. We really enjoyed the server.


        We will definitely be back to this little gem tucked in a strip mall off
        Ft Union.

        Prices are great, staff is very efficient and friendly. All the sushi
        rolls we ordered were awesome. I used to go to simply sushi, and a
        favorite of mine was the spicy upside down shrimp and was very sad to
        see they only had upside down shrimp. So, just a shrimp with rice on
        top. Still ordered the upside down shrimp and was surprised. It's
        amazing and I would recommend anyone coming here to try them, they are
        topped with some ingredients and it does have a bit of spice to it!
        Super delicious! First time I went with my family, the waiter made some
        kid friendly chop sticks for our son. Great atmosphere, very clean and
        maintained with phenomenal staff.
