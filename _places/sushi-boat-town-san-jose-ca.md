        I went here with friends for dinner. They had delicious fare from sushi
        rolls to ramen to bento boxes. We sat at a table so we could partake of
        our conversation and subsequent laughter but single or couples can sit
        at the sushi boat and snag delicious sushi from the ever rotating sushi
        boat trolley. Good food, good service

        Food was good, spacious and clean interior, drinks had free refill

        Cons: very limited options on the train, when I asked to refill one roll
        on the train, it never happened and I never got that roll on the train
        again! Prices are not reasonable

        I never really find many sushi boat restaurants anymore (but a similar
        concept is being spread with kura with their conveyor system), but this
        one in south san jose is still one if the traditional sushi boat
        restaurants you'd find in the mid 2000's to mid 2010's! You can choose
        to sit around the sushi boats or sit at a booth as you wish. Like all
        other sushi boat restaurants, you grab little plates of sushi and
        depending on the plate it was served on, that was the price. Prices of
        sushi on the boats ranged from $4.30 to $10. On a lunch day like this,
        not too many sushi were on the boats unfortunately... maybe it might be
        more popular at dinner or weekends.


        If the sushis on the boat dont appeal too well, there are many more
        options available through their huge menu! There are teriyaki plates to
        bento boxes to even a unique burrito sushi roll style dish! I ordered a
        bento box and the beef tasted pretty good minus the sauce which felt
        flat. It came with soup and salad and rice as well as a orange and
        dumpling! The main highlight of the bento box though was the tempura! It
        was really crispy and well breaded and fried! I loved the sauce it came
        with as well! $20


        Service was very minimal and most interaction i had was just the payment
        as soon as i was done. But the place seemed to be well staffed and got
        around to anyone needing refills, etc.


        Overall it was a pretty good experience! Although the bento box kinda
        felt a little overpriced...

        I always go for lunch. The food is fresh and there are great lunch
        items. The service is great and I see that people from a nearby school
        go there for lunch as well.

        Affordable and I go to the nearby laundromat and throw a load in while I
        have lunch. Works for me!
