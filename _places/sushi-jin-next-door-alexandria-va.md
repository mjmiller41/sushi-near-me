        I was visiting the area and it was convenient place, so we stopped by.
        From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm smiles and
        exceptional hospitality.


        The sushi itself was nothing short of amazing. The fish was incredibly
        fresh, and the combination of textures and flavors in each dish was
        perfectly balanced. The specialty rolls, in particular, were a standout
        – creative, beautiful to look at. I didn’t know it was gonna come with
        great representation.


        What truly made the experience memorable. The staff were friendly,
        attentive, and knowledgeable. They took the time to explain the menu,
        offer recommendations, and check in on us throughout the meal, ensuring
        we had everything we needed. It is definitely worth a visit.


        They have the parking garage inside a building and if not sure, please
        call them.

        The sushi itself was nothing short of amazing. The fish was incredibly
        fresh, and the combination of textures and flavors in each dish was
        perfectly balanced. The specialty rolls, in particular, were a standout
        – creative, beautiful to look at. I didn’t know it was gonna come with
        great representation.


        What truly made the experience memorable. The staff were friendly,
        attentive, and knowledgeable. They took the time to explain the menu,
        offer recommendations, and check in on us throughout the meal, ensuring
        we had everything we needed. It is definitely worth a visit.


        They have the parking garage inside a building and if not sure, please
        call them.

        Small space, no bar, seems more like a fast food atmosphere. I wish the
        hostess told me they’re closing soon so i had more time to make a
        decision; food was good, drinks mediocre for the price, only sake wine
        and beer. Overall good food but wont be back. I need more friendly
        service and a better drink menu for a return visit.

        Sushi Jin is always very delicious and there’s always a welcoming server
        to help. They are very child friendly as well as dietary restrictions
        friendly sushi Jin has been nothing but nice and a beautiful addition to
        the downtown Silver Spring area. my server Jeane was amazing and made
        sure I was taken care of the entire time. Thank you. I will be back.

        It all started when my best friend and I individually drove past Sushi
        Jin and somehow both said “hey we should try that Sushi place on the
        corner!”. Well we tried it out one night, and the rest was history. In
        the time she lived in Arlington, we ate at, or ordered Sushi Jin at
        least once a week. The restaurant is comfortable and modern, and the
        staff are so friendly and welcoming. Every time is just as good as the
        last. The extensive and creative vegetarian options are so delicious and
        delightful. A true testimony to how sushi can still be just as unique
        and satisfying- yet plant based. I find this to be a rare quality in
        sushi offerings elsewhere. They are all amazing choices, but the fried
        avocado roll is my favorite item on the menu. The spicy Mayo is always
        just right. The grilled edamame is incredible. They know what they’re
        doing. Eventually my best friend moved away, so I don’t find myself
        going there as often without her but she will frequently text me about
        how much she misses it too. It will forever be a very special place to
        me. Sushi Jin is hands down the best sushi. Love you guys.

        I have placed online orders here about 3 or 4 times now, and I'm very
        impressed with the quality and taste of their fish. I have gotten a
        sashimi bowl, sushi rolls, and poké bowl and have been impressed with
        the quality and quantity. A few times I have had to bring part of my
        lunch home because it was more than I could eat. My order has always
        been expertly prepared, the restaurant is clean and well organized, the
        staff is friendly and capable. I will continue to order from Sushi Jin.
