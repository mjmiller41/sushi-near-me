        Last evening at Kyōten was enchanted. The bar seats eight people. And
        there is only a single seating per night at 6:30. The base price on a
        Friday/weekend is $490 + tax, and my bill was $557 with one delicious
        sake.


        Chef Otto Phan is Vietnamese-American, and he’s obsessed with Japanese
        ingredients and flavors. He doesn’t do anything that steps afoul of
        Japanese traditions, but he’s also not constrained by them. Phan is a
        wunderkind with close relationships built with mentors and purveyors in
        Tokyo, who he visits twice annually and texts daily. Like an investor on
        the phone with a trader on the exchange floor, the fish traders on the
        floor of Tokyo’s bustling fish markets text Phan daily updates about
        what looks extraordinary, and so Phan’s menu is seasonal, based on the
        market’s best daily offering, and features only wild-caught fish. This,
        and the fact that Phan personally prepares every bite dispelled my
        concern that the cost of dinner was gratuitous. After dining and
        understanding the premium Phan pays for his ingredients, the cost makes
        sense.


        Everything tasted delicious. There was one course I couldn’t eat,
        monkfish liver, but I did have the slightest nibble and it was buttery,
        mild, and delicious, and I loved its ginger teriyaki bath. As a wildlife
        disease epidemiology researcher, I’m essentially a parasitologist. And
        once I interact with a research specimen in the field, my ability to eat
        a clean version of that thing raw in the future is done. It’s why raw
        proteins are nearly impossible for me in general. I put my rules and
        prejudices aside and ate course after course of Phan’s transportingly
        delicious fish painted with sauces, glistening, sliced, pinched,
        sometimes packed over delicious rice, and often concealing a poultice of
        wasabi, citrus zest, horseradish, ginger, or other complementary
        aromatics taking each bite to the next level. Some courses I enjoyed
        with my eyes closed to focus on the flavors, not caring that I may have
        looked weird. The two tempura courses, lobster with its roe, and
        beltfish, were my favorites.


        Another protein that I generally don’t enjoy raw is beef. Phan’s wagyu
        nigiri looks extremely rare, but it spends four hours in the sous vide
        and its fats and juices melt in your mouth. My enjoyment of this wagyu
        was in contrast to wagyu I was served last week at a different
        restaurant’s tasting menu where a nearly fist-sized rose-shaped wad of
        too much wagyu to serve in one bite made me channel my inner Khaleesi as
        I imagined myself as Daenerys Targaryen trying to choke down a whole
        horse heart. Phan’s wagyu course, like all of his courses, I truly
        enjoyed.


        Phan is an artist, and watching his passion and giftedness was
        thrilling. His hands squeezing the rice or shaping the fish and the
        gleam in his eyes made me think of the Japanese aesthetic principle of
        wabi-sabi, which embraces imperfection, transience, and connection to
        nature. Here is this beautiful young chef in his absolute prime, with
        extraordinary fish that he instructs you to eat the moment he places it
        on your plate not waiting for the diner next to you to receive theirs,
        and we’re tasting the fruits of our oceans, which are in a race against
        time both literally with a short window on their peak freshness, and
        also figuratively as our oceans are warming.


        I fell in love last night.

        Last evening at Kyōten was enchanted. The bar seats eight people. And
        there is only a single seating per night at 6:30. The base price on a
        Friday/weekend is $490 + tax, and my bill was $557 with one delicious
        sake.


        Chef Otto Phan is Vietnamese-American, and he’s obsessed with Japanese
        ingredients and flavors. He doesn’t do anything that steps afoul of
        Japanese traditions, but he’s also not constrained by them. Phan is a
        wunderkind with close relationships built with mentors and purveyors in
        Tokyo, who he visits twice annually and texts daily. Like an investor on
        the phone with a trader on the exchange floor, the fish traders on the
        floor of Tokyo’s bustling fish markets text Phan daily updates about
        what looks extraordinary, and so Phan’s menu is seasonal, based on the
        market’s best daily offering, and features only wild-caught fish. This,
        and the fact that Phan personally prepares every bite dispelled my

        I used to live and work in Tokyo. This is the first real Japanese
        restaurant that I’ve been to since I’ve been back. So authentic.
        Everything was amazing. I highly recommend.

        This is my second time dining here.  Chef Phan has taken what was
        already the best omakase in Chicago and elevated it to one of the best
        omakase experiences anywhere.  So many interesting and unique courses
        and unexpected flavors ... this is multiple michelin star worthy
        dining.  The new menu is pricey, but your group will have the entire
        restaurant to itself for the evening, and the value in the ingredients
        and execution is absolutely there.  Can’t recommend highly enough.
