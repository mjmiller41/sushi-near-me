        Amazing fresh sushi and miso soup everything we tried was wonderful. The
        Anger Management roll was large enough that we each had two bites per
        one slice. The Unagi Pizza was interesting and tasty but we were full so
        packed it home. The rib eye steak bento box offered the best variety
        with tempura veggies, California roll and the beef. Everything was fresh
        and fast and the staff was very friendly. I would recommend the Angry
        Fish, "greatest little secret of San Leandro"

        It's our first time here. The food was fantastic, and the service was
        excellent. Fresh oysters were amazing! We'll definitely come back. We
        ordered the Sunshine, Rainbow, and Angry Fish rolls, as well as Japanese
        pasta for my daughter.

        Excellent customer service and very impressive happy hours menu (ending
        late at 7p, Fried Chicken Soft Bone is a must try). I have yet to try
        their variety of toro (bluefin tuna) as they’ve run out of it every
        time. I’d definitely come back for that soon and hopefully to improve my
        food rating.

        A member of our gourmand group had lunch at Angry Fish a couple of days
        ago and was impressed with the food and the prices.  He recommended it
        to our group and we visited for dinner on Friday night.  The selection
        was impressive and every dish was fresh and tasty.  Jackie, our server,
        was among one of the best we have seen.  He was quick, courteous,
        patient, and an absolute delight.  Despite a packed house, he answered
        each and every question this group of seniors presented, he also took
        the initiative to repeat the answers or his recommendations to those
        sitting at the other end of the table since we were a pretty big group. 
        Every request, be it extra napkins, chopsticks, replacement of dishes,
        etc. etc. were promptly fulfilled with smiles and super efficiency.  We
        never have to ask for anything twice, he remembers everything.  Every
        dish he recommended was excellent.  We were all very happy with the food
        and are super impressed with the excellent service.

        Angry Fish is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants and sushi places.
        Everything about them is amazing. The food is great and the service is
        friendly and polite. The only thing is the menu is a bit pricey, but
        other than that, Angry Fish is perfect. 10/10 highly recommended.
