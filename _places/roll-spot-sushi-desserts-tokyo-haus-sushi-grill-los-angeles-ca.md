        I had the unfortunate experience of dining at this sushi restaurant, and
        it was honestly the worst sushi I've ever had. The rolls were drowning
        in mayo to the point where they were inedible. We got three rolls and
        all three were inedible. On top of that, the prices were quite high for
        what we received. I strongly do not recommend this place to anyone
        looking for good sushi. There are far better options in town.

        Gave this place a try since everybody deserves some loving. I asked for
        a Salmon Steak Salad and a Crunch Alaskan Roll. My brother went with the
        Salmon Crispy Garlic Roll.


        The menu is self explanatory. I had been looking for a good sushi place.
        This hidden gem was just what I was looking for. I enjoyed both dishes.
        Fresh taste. Salmon was delicious on both the salad and the sushi.


        My brother said he enjoyed as well. We asked each other if we would
        return and that was a confirmed yes. Good food. The wait was a bit
        because my dishes were baked but well worth it.


        Thank you.

        Roll Spot is a relatively new restaurant (couple years) but it still
        doesn’t look up to date. They always advertise 50% off all sushi
        (nigiri) and cut/hand rolls, but that actually just brings them down to
        average prices. Across the board, their menu is regularly priced like
        their competitors in the same ballpark, so that just leaves quality and
        portion size to differ.

        I got a Washington roll and it came out fast. It looks like their roll
        is a little shorter than others, with fewer pieces but looking at the
        second picture, they provide a significantly larger portion of salmon
        and crab meat per piece. This was really tasty but I left still a little
        hungry because there’s not that much rice. If you’re starving, skip out
        on their rolls, but go for it in any other scenario.

        I stopped by 4 days ago. l ordered sashimi.

        It was the most delicious sashimi I've ever had in the world.

        The price was cheap.

        The 2 staff were friendly and made me happy.

        It was a short lunch break, but it will be memorable for a long time.
        Highly recommended.

        Have you seen better sushi deals than the ones they have at
        @rollspotlittletokyo ? This tucked away gem opened in the thick of covid
        and, amidst the reopening of society, is welcoming patrons with half off
        sushi! This alone was enough to get me through the door, but then i
        noticed all the other FANTASTIC specials they have running. And to make
        matters even better, they have a 4.5 star Yelp rating. I think the only
        thing needed to take them to 5 stars is some more comfortable seating
        (it’s the metal tables and chairs). So it’s not a sake date night type
        of place, but cute for a lunch or a quick bite. It definitely has enough
        potential to be my regular sushi spot.
