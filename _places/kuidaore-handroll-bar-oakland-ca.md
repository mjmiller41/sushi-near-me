        The food was delicious, nothing super innovative, but tasty fish,
        perfectly crisp nori and fun cocktails. I loved the happy spoons and
        premium hand rolls. No complaints about the food, but it was quite
        expensive, two of us spent 200 including tip and I was still hungry.


        The service and ambiance are my reason for less stars. The lights are
        extremely bright so that detracted from the experience. Some softer,
        warmer light for evening would bring the vibe up to match the pricing
        would be an easy fix. The staff was nice enough but it felt more cafe
        casual and unrefined.


        I would maybe try it again for lunch if they had a lunch special.

        Best handrolls I've had in the Bay. We went for Oakland's Restaurant
        Week and the menu was spectacular. Everything was delicious. Highly
        recommended!

        I had high hopes for this hand roll spot in Oakland, but overall, the
        experience was pretty underwhelming. The food is very average, and a lot
        of it seems like it's just pre-made items that you can easily pick up at
        a Japanese market or wholesaler. The seaweed salad, wasabi octopus, and
        ankimo all tasted like they were store-bought, not freshly made
        in-house.


        To make matters worse, the seaweed on the rolls was wet and soft,
        completely lacking the crisp texture you'd expect. For the price, I was
        expecting much higher quality and attention to detail. Unfortunately, it
        just didn’t live up to that. If you're paying a premium, you expect
        fresh, unique dishes, not things you could grab off a shelf at a market.
        Not worth it for what they charge.


        It felt more like a cheap American sushi roll place trying to act like
        trendy and high end dining.


        Not recommended at all, very amateur

        Great location and good quality of food with affordable price! TBH the
        flavor is a little bland, but all the hand rolls match well with the soy
        sauce provided. They have REAL WASABI and this is definitely a plus for
        this restaurant. Uni, toro & caviar hand roll I tried today is 100%
        amazing. Looking forward to its grand opening!

        Delicious food, friendly staff, and great location! We LOVED the maguro
        and hamachi crudos. The seaweed salad was simple and yummy. The hand
        rolls in the 4 combo were each unique with perfectly crispy nori and
        fresh fish or veggies, and the hot sake hit the spot! We were happy to
        have room for the jasmine ice cream and calamansi sorbet as well - both
        really tasty and creative - don't skip dessert!


        We are so excited that they're finally open and are definitely coming
        back soon!
