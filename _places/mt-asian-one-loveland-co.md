        Convenient location and parking lot, upscale and clean atmosphere, and
        delicious food!


        Generous portions of fresh and tasty meals prepared quickly for you.
        Great service! Fried food is not greasy, but crispy, tasty, and fresh!
        Plenty of selections, including homemade sushi. And it is very
        affordable!


        For the special Chinese dishes, ask them for the special Chinese menu!!
        (Written in Chinese only!)

        This is my favorite sushi place in NOCO. Not only is the food always
        fresh and well prepared with excellent presentation, the family-owned
        atmosphere feels like home. The owners are always welcoming and so
        lovely. Recommend 10/10 always!

        This is by far one of the best Asian restaurants I’ve ever been to! It
        definitely deserved a review.

        The food is all delicious! For starters, the inside of the restaurant is
        beautiful. We came in during dinner time. The hot and sour soup was
        perfectly hot in temperature as it should be! My partner and I ordered
        the sesame chicken and chicken and beef lo mein! The portions were so
        big which makes me happy because I love taking leftovers.


        The sesame chicken was still crispy and I love that the chicken wasn’t
        overly battered my partner loved his sesame chicken!

        The Lomein was so delicious it came in a very generous portion. I am so
        happy to of made the trip here even though it’s 50 minutes away from my
        home I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu!

        5 stars for me ! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

        The service is excellent, and even better, the food! Holy Toledo, do
        yourself a favor? Skip Panda Express across the street and give this
        place a try! The portions are plentiful, the boba teas exquisite, the
        staff members are on it, and the bathrooms are clean! Love having this
        place in town.

        We went here for lunch and the food and service were terrific. I
        recommend asking them for their "secret menu," which contains a dish
        with fish in a Szechuan peppercorn sauce that was really outstanding.
        Mapo tofu and beef drunken noodles were also very good. I went with my
        old friend from China, and he and the server (Kimi I believe) were going
        back and forth in Mandarin. Our dishes seemed very authentic. Service
        was great, too.
