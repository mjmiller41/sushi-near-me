        My first visit to Chinatown in DC led me to Wok and Roll Karaoke, and it
        was a delightful experience. The atmosphere was calm and inviting,
        perfect for a quiet evening out. The staff were not only friendly but
        also communicated well, making the visit even more enjoyable. While the
        food was slightly on the pricier side, the Dynamite Roll was absolutely
        worth it—bursting with flavor and expertly prepared. I can’t wait to
        return and explore more of their sushi offerings! If you’re strolling
        through Chinatown in the evening, I highly recommend stopping by for a
        delicious bite and warm hospitality.

        I had a lot of fun doing karaoke here with friends! If you have a group
        of friends definitely consider doing this. I had cocktails but none of
        the food seemed really appetizing for me. I think it will be better as
        some handheld foods or something a little dry because it seemed like
        rice would just be messy with the chaos happening inside of a karaoke
        room.


        The workers worked very hard to have everything work well so the
        bartenders could really mix a cocktail. They were perfectly nice and
        fine. Everybody was great and quick and great service. I really enjoyed
        doing karaoke here. It was a lot of fun.

        The food was so good and large portions to share with table. The
        location was a good walk. The menu has a large variety. There are only a
        few vegetarian options. The waitress was kind and patient with our
        questions. Inside is a little outdated as well as outside, but the food
        trumps it all!

        I ordered the eggplant and shrimp fried rice.  Both were excellent and
        the best I've had in DC!  Staff was mixed...they left me standing at the
        door for a minute or two before finally letting me in.  One woman
        standing my the bar completely ignored me, but the woman who came out to
        serve me was super sweet. I prefer not to be constantly bothered while
        I'm eating and reading, so I was fine with the level of service as she
        came quickly whenever I motioned to her.
