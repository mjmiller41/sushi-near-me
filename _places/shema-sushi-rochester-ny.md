        Wow- a legitimate sushi place.  If you’re looking for a good sushi place
        in Rochester, you don’t have many options— however, Shema Sushi, is one
        of the few exceptions.


        The fish was exceptionally fresh- the rolls were delicious and
        generously proportioned.  The tempura was some of the best I have had-
        you could appreciate the flavor of the vegyet the crust was perfectly
        fried and crisp without being overly oily . The takoyaki is the best
        I’ve had in Rochester, thus far and a must try!


        The service was great and the atmosphere is low key and relaxed. 
        Looking forward to going back soon!


        Update: have now been here multiple times-  service is always excellent,
        food is always incredible! Their ramen was awesome- absolutely the best
        in Rochester!

        This is one of the best sushi I've ever eaten! The quality of the fish
        and rice was far beyond extraordinary. All of my friends were amazed by
        the quality of the fish and the fact that they had been properly
        seasoned. The spicy tuna roll was my ultimate favorite, it reminded me
        of the ones I had when I was a child that I still remember vividly. The
        staff members were so friendly and made us immediately feel as if we
        were a part of their family.

        First time visit, and wow wow wow. I had a great quick chat the night
        before via Facebook messenger to verify they were open tonight for
        dinner. They were quick to respond and gave great information as to when
        the best time to arrive would be. We showed up and our server was
        friendly and very helpful when we had questions about menu items. The
        sake she helped us land on was the best I’ve ever had and was so good
        with our meal. The sushi boat was a huge value for everything you got,
        side note those pickles on there are AMAZING and should be a side dish
        of their own! The rolls are high quality ingredients and flavorful. The
        dishes arrived to our table so quickly, it was incredible. Everything
        looked beautiful and tasted even better. Again, our server was a delight
        and attentive to us, we have many other items we want to try, having the
        menu to review on your phone before ordering is helpful and well labeled
        to help deciding easier. I’m already wanting more sushi! Thank you for
        such a great experience, and will be back again soon. Highly recommend
        anyone to give this restaurant a try.

        Beautiful presentation and very fresh fish! Unique rolls, rare fish,
        very high quality flavors. I've eaten sushi in many places... Shema
        rates high. Unassuming location and cool decor combined with
        authentically friendly service. Everything from the Kani salad to the
        Toro was excellent and super fresh. We found this place by googling
        'Best Sushi in Rochester." Shema didn't disappoint.
