        Every dining experience at Nobu is exceptional. Definitely try the
        Lychee drink! I’m a bit of a wimp when it comes to spicy hot food. since
        the menu is a bit minimalist in description, be sure to ask your waiter
        about the levels of heat in the dishes.

        The salt and pepper squid is spicy. I thought it was black pepper but
        there is an extra kick. He brought me milk and I was back to normal just
        in time for dessert. Next time I will try the $200 tasting menu.

        about the levels of heat in the dishes.

        The salt and pepper squid is spicy. I thought it was black pepper but
        there is an extra kick. He brought me milk and I was back to normal just
        in time for dessert. Next time I will try the $200 tasting menu.

        As someone who enjoys exploring restaurants in the DMV, I can
        confidently say that Nobu is one of my go-to restaurants. The
        comfortable atmosphere along with the phenomenal service, and lastly the
        mouthwatering food have made each of my dining experiences unique.


        The dishes check the marks every time. The protein is also cooked to
        perfection, and the plating of the dishes is divine.

        Nobu always delivers an amazing experience from start to finish! Over
        the last 4 years we have enjoyed numerous meals here.

        Staff is always polite and professional. Service is always above and
        beyond. Zoe always ensures our experience is amazing. Her knowledge of
        the food and ingredients, her recommendations, and her hospitality truly
        exceed anywhere else we have experienced.

        And the food.. you truly can’t go wrong with anything here. Our
        favorites are the new style sashimi and the new style salmon rolls.
        Truly unbelievable and just melts in your mouth. The yellowtail jalapeño
        is a must. The wagyu dumplings are just devine, great sear on the
        outside and a soft and succulent burst of flavor once you bite into it.
        The scallop jalapeño with shaved Brussels sprouts is another fave that
        hits every time.

        Close it all out with the mini donuts that are fried and tossed in
        cinnamon sugar, topped with caramel sauce and a scoop of vanilla gelato.

        Tip: they have a pretty sweet happy hour during the week if you’re
        looking for just a couple of rolls and apps.

        We had Christmas Day brunch here and the buffet was sublime. The service
        was on point and friendly, and the atmosphere was very nice. The food
        was amazing. This was some of the best sushi I've had outside of Asia.
        The yellowtail nigiri was particularly good, and the seared salmon and
        fluke were also great. The hot cooked on-demand items from the menu were
        also quite good but the portions were very large; the salmon was cooked
        perfectly and it was a meal in and of itself.

        We had a 29-person party and it was an AMAZING experience!! The manager,
        TJ, and the supporting staff were great! Everyone provided details of
        the 8-course meal as it was being served. The food was authentic with
        delicious flavors. (Salty, umami, and spicy to name a few) The food was
        also fresh and healthy. The drinks were also good. They had something
        for everyone with at least 3 drinks in each category. Example: The sweet
        drinks went from fruity tart and mild to very sweet.

        I will be back and I strongly recommend Nobu for dinner dates and large
        party dinners.
