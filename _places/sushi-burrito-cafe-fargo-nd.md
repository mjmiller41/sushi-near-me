        I got the vegetarian sushi burrito and it was the perfect post-flight
        victory bite.

        Even more delicious seeing how vegetarian conscious they are! She was
        excited to tell me about the sauce they make for their Thai dishes in
        liu of fishy and I'm excited to come back to try them!


        My Okinawa milk tea had soft boba (LOVE) and a great strong flavor. The
        only downside is I don't think it's gonna survive my 3-hr commute.

        I've been here a few times over the past year. Consistently great stuff.
        I've had both a custom burrito and a custom poke bowl (see photos). I'm
        not a raw fish person myself, so I'm happy that they have the beef
        bulgogi as well as crab/crab salad and options that aren't only raw
        sushi. Very tasty, friendly staff, great beverages (the Taro milk tea is
        great). If one thing could be improved, the tortillas are maybe a bit
        thick.

        The last time I ordered from here, I got sick from the food. I wanted to
        like it, but the rice was way overcooked so it was soggy and the
        overpowering flavor from the eel sauce or spicy mayo was too much. It
        tasted mediocre and wasn’t the greatest imo.

        Friendly folks.  Menu is available in about five versions, but all the
        same.  It's definitely a neat take on sushi and poke by putting it in a
        wrap.

        Sushi Burrito sounds a lot better than it is, and the Sushi Burrito Cafe
        itself LOOKS better than it is.. sorry, but it’s a 2-1 overthrow here,
        and the odds aren’t looking great.


        But, it’s still not bad by any standards. I mean, I still gave them 4
        stars as you can see and I wouldn’t just do that for no reason. Only,
        I’ve had sushi burritos at other places before, and they are way better
        than the one I tried here. Fargo just struggles with its sushi, and what
        else could you expect from a land locked frozen tundra with few people?


        I just love the cafe itself- it’s dreamy, it’s sparkly, it’s relaxing
        and it’s aesthetic. Superb for sitting down to eat and enjoy the space.
        I got one of the spicy burritos, and MAN was it spicy. Hot dang! I can
        take a lot of spice and I love spice, but this was too much to be
        honest. And I felt that the seaweed wrap was too sticky and the texture
        just wasn’t quite right. But you also have the option of getting a
        regular tortilla wrap if you don’t want seaweed. Thought it’s a nice
        option, it just seemed weird to me.


        We also got boba, because of course a sushi burrito joint would serve
        bubble tea too! I really enjoyed that- but the boba was a tad too soft,
        it was almost just melt in your mouth, and anyone who’s had boba a lot
        knows it should be more chewy and a bit solid. It’s a delicate balance.
        But overall I’d definitely come back and 100% enjoy it! Just maybe
        getting something slightly less spicy, lol.
