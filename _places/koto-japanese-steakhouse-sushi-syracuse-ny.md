        Me and my friend came here to get food for our school trip, he got the
        sushi with fried rice and I got the chicken with fried rice. It was 21
        for BOTH!! and we ate to the point of being uncomfortably full and
        barely made a dent in our food. Very good, very cheap for what it was!
        Highly recommend

        Went here for lunch. Even though it’s in the mall It’s still large
        portion sizes for a good price.. Best take out I’ve had in a long time.
        Food is made when you order, area is clean, food was made quick, hot,
        fresh, and staff is super friendly. Absolutely worth it.

        I don’t know how much was spent as I didn’t pay. The drinks were really
        good I loved the sweet potato roll as well. The people with me got a
        poke poll, shrimp tempura roll, spicy tuna roll, noodles and beef bowl.
        The food was pretty good overall I did feel like we were rushed out a
        bit but many people weren’t there at the time.

        My wife and I went here for hibachi for her birthday.  Sat at a table
        with another couple and a mother and her kids.  Cook was good, checked
        the meat to make sure it met the order and read the table well to see
        that none of us were there to party.


        Menu was simple, but solid.  Got the steak and scallop combo and enjoyed
        them.  Service was top-notch.


        Price was as expected; expect to pay a bit more than just getting served
        at a table.


        Double-edged sword that it's in DestinyUSA.  Convenient for dinner and a
        movie, but malls can be off-putting.

        It has been 4 years since we dined at this restaurant, located adjacent
        to the carousel at the Destiny Mall. We shouldn't have waited so long
        because we enjoyed good food on our return. I had a taste of my wife's
        dish, Pad Thai with tofu, and it was quite flavorful. Also, my Filet
        Mignon Teriyaki with tender-crisp vegetables included a very generous
        amount of tender steak cooked as ordered. The service was good except
        that our mains were delivered shortly after our appetizers, a California
        Roll, and a Salad. Some spacing would have been appreciated. Also, the
        check was brought to our table without first asking if we would like to
        look at the dessert menu. Overall, it was an enjoyable meal.
