        Very neat new place, owners did all the construction work themselves.
        Lovely wooden accent wall and epoxy flooring. The service is good, and I
        can tell the staff gets overwhelmed by the door dash calls, the toppings
        looked fresh, I think some proportioning training is still needed. I say
        that because the staff was being very careful with the scooping and
        putting some back and the sauce was way too much and it soaked the rice,
        was too salty to eat the bottom portions. Maybe come up with a better
        way to potion control and scoop with a system in place. It’s okay to
        weight at first

        I've eaten here dozens of times, today I came in and ordered what I
        wanted. I was told my rice needed to cool and the young lady took 20+
        minutes to wait on the people behind me. Unacceptable behavior and
        terrible service. Also it was made up. The rice was fine as it was. I
        walked out after waiting over 20 minutes for people behind me in line to
        be waited on. I doubt yall can afford this level of service for regular
        paying customers. I won't be back to find out though.

        Came here today and the service was good but everything in the bowl
        tasted refrigerated. The crab and shrimp tasted like bleach now my
        husband and I left with headaches and an empty stomach. Extremely
        disappointing waste of $40.

        I'm just leaving the review because this place is always really awesome.
        And most of the time I go in there they're young ladies who work there,
        Who are excellent, But this time there was a taller guy who was acting
        like he was sick , sniffling and he grabbed his gloves and he blew into
        his gloves. halfway on top of his gloves and inside of his gloves while
        standing over the food so basically all of his stuff inside his mouth.  
        Went all over the food and all over his gloves, and I'm not gonna eat at
        a place that does that. That's disgusting.Nobody wants to eat
        food.That's been blown on by someone else.
