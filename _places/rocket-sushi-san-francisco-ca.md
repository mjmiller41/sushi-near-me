        I had dinner here on a Thursday evening. We were seated immediately and
        were immediately taken with the cool tablet that you use to order food
        and the "rocket sleds" that deliver the food. In addition to the
        ingenious and fun aspects of the restaurant, the star of the show was
        the food. I've had sushi all over the world, including many times in
        Japan, and I can honestly say that I've never had nigiri with such
        generous portions of totally fresh fish. Granted, the prices are
        relatively high (like $14 for two pieces) but given that you're getting
        about double the fish you'd normally see on a piece of nigiri, I think
        it's a fair price.


        In addition to nigiri, we had a couple of rolls and miso soup. All was
        top notch. If you're looking for a fun place to have truly amazing
        sushi, this is your place. Highly recommended!

        This place is great. I don't even know why they have servers. We'll I
        understand why they have them. Anyway, service was helpful and on top of
        it. You order off a tablet at the table and your food arrives on a
        rocket train to your table. It was way cool. Recommend going just to
        watch that. They also had vegan rolls and other options for vegan.

        I ordered the Candle Stick roll and an amazing Golden Spicy Tuna roll.

        For ambience, you will be dining in bright,  functional lighting next to
        a long table covered in the supplies needed to prepare delivery orders,
        but the food is truly great

        Lunch on Sunday last week for party of two. Sashimi was tasty and looked
        fresh. Love their raw fatty tuna, 4 large slices with each one scored in
        diamond pattern for better easier enjoyment. Unagi nigiri and toro
        nigiri were huge, not the typical one bite size. Also had two
        appetizers, fried calamari and tempura platter but they were a bit too
        greasy I found. Servers checked in with us several times during our meal
        and refilled our tea and ginger. Will dine again.
