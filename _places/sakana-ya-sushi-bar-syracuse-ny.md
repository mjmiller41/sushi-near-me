        Conveyor belt sushi in Syracuse, ya that is right. In Armory Square
        area, you will find this little restaurant cranking out sushi for locals
        and tourists. We were shocked to find it, and after already eaten lunch,
        we had to try. The sushi rice was very good. Fish is what you expect for
        sushi in North America, acceptable, but it's not Japan. However, the
        winner here is the 50% off during happy hour and the conveyor belt
        experience. Will be back with the kids.

        Conveyor belt sushi in Syracuse, ya that is right. In Armory Square
        area, you will find this little restaurant cranking out sushi for locals
        and tourists. We were shocked to find it, and after already eaten lunch,
        we had to try. The sushi rice was very good. Fish is what you expect for
        sushi in North America, acceptable, but it's not Japan. However, the
        winner here is the 50% off during happy hour and the conveyor belt
        experience. Will be back with the kids.

        (3/13/2025) Update, second trip was way better. I went with a friend to
        the dining room for restaurant week and foe thirty bucks a person we got
        stuffed with amazing Asian cuisine. We loved it. Friendly staff and
        great food. Very clean and quick service.


        (First review 8/7/2024) So my sister and I went on a Monday which is
        apparently half off most items and it was interesting. We had all sorts
        of rolls. The plates are color-coated to indicate the price and it's
        easy to figure out but check to see if it's a half-off time window. I
        didn't realize we were saving until we got the check. I went for my
        birthday, having not had sushi in years and it was a good experience.

        I loved this place! Cheap half price sushi on Monday, conveyor belt
        sushi is always a blast. But the real treat was when i ordered some
        fresh

        The 007 and fruit rolls were 🔥🔥🔥

        Absolutely delicious. I went back 3 times for those alone. They also had
        great crab Rangoons for the price


        And my server was so so so nice! His favorite roll was also the fruit
        roll, younger with glasses. I'm sorry i didn't get your name!!! Super
        super lovely, great service, very nice and welcoming

        I mean you can’t really get better than sushi on a conveyor belt. The
        atmosphere is great. The conveyor sushi belt is such a cool and fun
        concept. They have easily 20+ sushi options going around at all times.
        We sampled about 10 different varieties when we went and were not
        disappointed. The sushi bar is currently running half off sushi form the
        conveyor belt so not only is it delicious sushi but also a stellar
        price. This place was a blast and everything fresh and delicious. Can’t
        wait to go back. Keep in mind, prices are listed by the color of the
        plate and it’s easy to eat a lot of sushi and rack up a large tab so
        keep that in mind.

        The atmosphere was clean and bright with a general feel good vibe. The
        sushi I had was very good. The mango had tuna in it and it was very
        refreshing taste that was both sweet and spicy. The she so hot roll also
        was very good. I like hot but this wasn’t super hot but very flavorful.
        My friend got orange chicken and it was good. My wife got bee bop (
        Korean dish) and she loved it. The waiter was very friendly and helpful
