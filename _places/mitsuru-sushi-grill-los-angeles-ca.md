        We explore this place based on Google review. We ordered their lunch
        special, and the food taste decently good. However, the serving speed is
        a bit slow, considering it’s late afternoon and we are the only customer
        there. All else is good, and staff is friendly too.

        This is a retro restaurant, been here for decades. The food is
        traditional Japanese, sukiyaki was excellent!


        Everybody's orders were also well done: salmon skin salad was delicious,
        the omelette and tuna salad.


        I ordered tonkatsu to go and that was delicious, not dry at all.


        It is a small cafe so be patient. Your order is coming.

        The food that they prepare is surprising considering what the inside of
        the restaurant looks like. The udon soup that my grandma got was rich
        with flavor and the green tea that I got with the miso soup was perfect.
        The server was lovely and the food came out fast. She made sure were
        taken care of but it was slow at the time too so that helped with the
        quick service.


        The negatives include it smelling a little funky walking it, it looking
        like the furniture and utilities haven't been updated in decades, and
        the places out of the way (but still in view) looking not clean. There
        is a restroom with a nice toilet no less, but I don't want to touch
        anything else in there.

        A Symphony of Flavors at Mitsuru Sushi and Grill


        After an extended hiatus from indulging in the art of sushi, my return
        to the experience at Mitsuru Sushi and Grill was nothing short of
        extraordinary. This hidden gem, which I stumbled upon through a friend’s
        recommendation, proved to be a culinary revelation.


        As a party of three, we embarked on a gastronomic journey, each
        selecting different dishes to sample the breadth of the menu. The
        ‘Special B’ sushi platter at Mitsuru was a masterful display of
        freshness and finesse, each slice of sashimi whispering tales of the sea
        with its impeccable texture and taste. The ‘Rainbow Roll,’ true to its
        name, was a vibrant mosaic of flavors that melded in harmony,
        captivating our palates with every bite.


        The Ramen was an authentic rendition of this classic dish, with a broth
        that was rich and robust, cradling tender slices of pork that melted in
        our mouths, while the marinated eggs added a level of umami that was
        simply transcendent. The Gyozas were the perfect accompaniment, their
        crisp exteriors giving way to succulent fillings that were a testament
        to the chef’s prowess at Mitsuru.


        It’s not just the food that makes Mitsuru Sushi and Grill special. It’s
        the feeling of discovery, the joy of sharing exceptional food with good
        company, and the promise of returning to what now feels like a culinary
        haven.


        In conclusion, Mitsuru Sushi and Grill is a celebration of Japanese
        cuisine, a place where each dish is crafted with passion and precision.
        For anyone seeking an authentic sushi experience, Mitsuru deserves not
        just a visit, but an encore.

        Nice little hole in the wall with affordable food! I discovered this
        place back in undergrad when they had (and still do) have very
        affordable lunch specials. Will definitely be back.


        At the time of our visit, I believe there was only 1 server, but later
        on (when we were leaving), we saw another staff member walk in.
