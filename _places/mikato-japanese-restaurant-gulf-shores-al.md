        Food was great, prices were great and service was great. Went with
        friends for Hibachi. Our chef was fun and funny, just the way you like
        your Hibachi. Lol! It was so much food, we had left overs. It was just
        as good the next day, which I love. We will be back.

        We hit up Mikato for Mom’s birthday bash,

        A private room in the back, away from the splash.

        Fifteen deep, ready to laugh and dine,

        Everything was awesome, we had a great time!


        But here’s a tip if you’re not gonna eat:

        They’ll charge you ten bucks just for your seat.

        Now, this makes sense in a big open space,

        But in a private room, it feels out of place.

        So grab your friend’s sushi if you don’t wanna pay,

        That’s the secret trick to save the day!


        Now Jimmy, our chef, what a dazzling pro,

        Put on a show with a fiery glow!

        Made us laugh, kept us grinning all night,

        With jokes and tricks, his timing was tight.


        Chicken’s texture? Not quite my groove,

        But the shrimp? Oh, it sure made a move!

        So here’s the deal, if you want a fun treat,

        Mikato’s got flavor and chefs you should meet!

        .

        If you're looking for authentic and honest reviews, be sure to follow me
        on Google Reviews. I am passionate about discovering delicious food and
        sharing my experiences with others.

        This place was awesome. The prices were good for the quality. The thing
        I find to be the most rare about eating at a sushi joint is that I
        always leave not full. This place I left stuffed. I even took home a
        doggy bag. Our waitress was super polite and attentive, my drink never
        got empty, and we had a blast. I recommend this for families. But also
        for dates it has a kind of upscale type atmosphere to it that could be
        Romantic.

        The food was okay compared to other hibachi restaurants I have been too.
        House salad was sour and the teriyaki was sour as well. The noodles were
        also salty. Our waitress (Asian lady) was very rude when we gave her a
        tip at the end of our meal. This restaurant has some cleaning up to do
        and needs a few upgrades!

        1st time to this restaurant.

        The shows were neat, and chefs are very talented.  The waitress was so
        sweet!! California rolls were awesome! The salad house salad dressing
        fish type of mayo. I'm not sure if I would like the ginger better.  The
        meat was just right.  The veggies were good.  fried rice was okay it had
        a charcoal tasting. The soup tastes

        like a broth of fish or beef with green onion and mushrooms.

        It was way too much food. Maybe I could have shared a plate. Pricey
        meal. Once a year thing. The place is very pretty and people are nice.
        we had a wait to on chef and we were sitted so I had an appetizer of
        California rolls to start.
