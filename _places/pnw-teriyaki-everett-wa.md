        The food I received was overwhelmingly salty. I ordered a chicken and
        beef combo, which had generous portions of meat at a reasonable price.
        However, the taste was dominated by saltiness, likely from an overly
        salty marinade and excessive teriyaki sauce. Reducing the salt or sauce
        significantly would improve it. I couldn’t eat this again as is. Still,
        I gave two stars instead of one because the service was quick and
        friendly. If they adjust the seasoning, it could be a great value. I
        hope they see this feedback, make changes, and invite me to try it again
        someday.

        We ordered the super combo and gyoza. The gyoza was 10 pieces and
        tasty.  The super combo included pork as well as beef and chicken.  The
        Teriyaki sauce on the side was thick and tasty.  We really enjoyed it.  
        A salad was served in its own box and it was as full as it as it could
        be.


        After finishing the meal my husband announced this was far better than
        our old Teriyaki place down the road, across from the lake.  We'll
        definitely be back.

        My friends and I ordered from this restaurant last evening. We all loved
        everything we ordered.  I personally had their spicy chicken teriyaki (5
        stars) plus gyoza. The spice level was PERFECT and exactly what I was
        looking for. The chicken is tender, juicy and flavorful. Their gyoza
        were cooked so nice and crispy and the filling was so tasty.  I really
        appreciated that. My friends ordered sesame chicken (also great) and
        some crab Rangoon. All in all it was a great experience and we will be
        ordering from here again. Thank you!

        I've been making my way down all of their sushi rolls and I have yet to
        be disappointed. They are super nice every time I visit. All in all it's
        my new favorite teriyaki and sushi spot to go to in this area. I highly
        recommend this place, give it a lick.
