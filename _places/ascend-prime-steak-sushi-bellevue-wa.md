        The best experience!! Everything from the view to the food, drinks, and
        service was stunning. We had so many people stopping by our table to see
        if we needed anything, I lost count. And one was just as knowledgeable
        about the menu offerings as the next. Definitely time your visit to see
        the sunset over the mountains! A dining experience to remember!

        Went here for a special night out and it was totally worth it. Perfect
        vibes for a date or anniversary, the view is amazing and the whole place
        has a really cool, fancy feel. The steak was good, drinks were on point
        too. Service was friendly and helpful the whole time. Yeah, it’s pricey,
        but you’re paying for the experience and the view, and I think it’s
        worth it for a special occasion. Also a great spot to take pics!

        From the moment I stepped into Ascend, I knew I was in for an
        extraordinary dining experience. The ambiance strikes a perfect balance
        between elegance and comfort, setting the stage for a memorable evening.
        The high-end service truly stood out; the staff was attentive without
        being intrusive, always ready to offer recommendations and ensure every
        need was met.

        The highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the dessert( Magic mushroom
        )It was nothing short of unforgettable. The flavors and textures
        harmonized perfectly, leaving a lasting impression that I still savor
        days later.

        Overall, Ascend is a gem that combines exquisite food with impeccable
        service. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion this restaurant
        is a must-visit. I can't wait to return!

        Celebrated my birthday here last night and it was really special! I had
        the joyride it came in a very unique cup which made the drink fun.
        Overall all of my friends really enjoyed this dinner we tried a mixture
        of sushi rolls and their signature Seahawk chop for the steak. It wasn’t
        my first time there but it was for some of my guests and they all had
        good things to say. Loan, our waitress also took really good care of us.
        & Aaron the general manager stopped by to drop off a surprise birthday
        dessert which came with dry ice.
