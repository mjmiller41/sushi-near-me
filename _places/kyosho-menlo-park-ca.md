        Very nice and cosy interior for a Japanese restaurant. Had the salmon
        roll with avocado which had yuzu sauce. This was nice and light and is
        recommended. The tempura udon was a sizeable dish. However, the udon
        soup was too salty. Overall a nice place for dinner.

        Chefs inside really understand what is a good Japanese food. The mustard
        is freshly ground, and the soy sauce is also specially added with sake
        and whiskey. But in fact, the sushi and sashimi produced by the chef
        have been seasoned and slightly added with mustard, so they can be eaten
        directly, and they are super delicious.


        Unlike other popular Japanese restaurants, many of its dishes are
        exclusively created. What you think is eel rice is actually eel clay pot
        rice, juicy, and there is also burnt rice! Can you believe that ordinary
        edamame is actually scooped with truffles? Even sea urchins, I ate three
        different ways in one meal. Every taste is top-notch. Simple wagyu udon,
        in fact, every grain of wagyu is the essence, crispy on the outside and
        has the delicate and juicy taste of wagyu itself. According to the chef,
        each piece of wagyu has Japanese birth certificate to ensure the
        authenticity of the source, and I am too lazy to count how many A's
        there are. The soup base is also homemade pork bone soup, and no
        pre-made soup bags are used.

        Loved the whole dining experience. The Omakase Nigiri started with a
        Prawn Miso Soup, followed by fresh and well-prepared sushi. We had two
        rolls together with a bottle of warm Sake as well.

        I recently visited Kyosho for lunch, and while the sushi rolls were
        pretty good, I was disappointed by the sashimi and nigiri, which lacked
        freshness. Surprisingly, the restaurant was completely empty, which made
        the rushed service even more odd. The server seemed eager to bring our
        check, making the experience feel unwelcoming. Unfortunately, to top it
        off, I ended up with a stomach ache after the meal. Overall, I wouldn’t
        recommend Kyosho based on my experience—there are better options out
        there for sushi.

        My husband became seriously ill with food poisoning after dining at this
        restaurant on 4/6/25. We are confident the cause was the sushi rolls
        only he ate.  I attempted to contact them the following morning to
        inform them, but the call went straight to a voicemail box that was
        full. It’s especially disappointing because our family has enjoyed meals
        here in the past—it’s always felt like a welcoming neighborhood spot.
        Unfortunately, after this experience, we won’t be returning.
