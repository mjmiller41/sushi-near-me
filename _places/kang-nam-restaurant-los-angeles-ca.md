        Very traditional style of KBBQ! Very earnest and not as flashy as some
        of the other KBBQ places in LA. Definitely not a crazy wait, which is
        nice if you want simple and quick KBBQ. They are hosting primarily
        outside in their parking lot cus of COVID and have heat lamps near the
        tables.


        They come out and help cook all the meats too so don't need to worry
        about doing it yourself unless you really want to. They also served it
        onto our plates once it was prime for eating.


        Overall, it was a good and classic KBBQ experience! Would definitely
        come back here if as it was very affordable and delicious.

        This is 3 rd time going to Kang Nam Restaurant this month. All 3 times
        proved to be a winner.  First time was with 4 people. 2nd time was 7 (so
        we got a private room), and today was 9 people ( very nice larger
        private room).

        We ordered various Korean food, but I stuck to various fish dishes:
        Grilled fish -pollock twice, today I ordered Eun Dae Gu jorim (my
        favorite -this was awesome!! ).  Others ordered Kalbi BBQ (without
        seasoning (?)$63! One ordered Kalbi Tang (beef soup- she loved it- good
        portion). One ordered Cold noodle and BBQ Kalbi combo (she said that was
        GREAT!), a vegetarian ordered Dwen jang soup (soy bean paste soup with
        veggies & tofu), one ordered Bibimbop (all kinds of veggies & bulgogi
        (BBQ beef) on top of rice (looked yum! I thought about ordering that
        myself, but went for Eun Dae Gu jorim ❤️‼️).  Did not disappoint!
        Everyone was very happy. All the side dishes were clean, appetizing, and
        plenty (no weird stuff 🤣.. I’m Korean but I like to stick to
        traditional ( ? standard) side dishes, no crabs 🦀 squid, 🐙 octopus,
        etc.(no thanks).

        Service was great, nice ladies were quick and attentive, quiet and
        brought more of anything we wanted in plenty quantity.

        Normally I have something to say (minor complaints) but I didn’t have
        any ❤️❤️❤️😃😃😃🎈🎈🎈


        It was so relaxing and enjoyable lunch with everyone enjoying their food
        🍱✅❤️💯


        Thank you for making this stressful time in our life bearable (my mom’s
        funeral arrangements, ashes pick up day, then a small gathering of
        relatives today.)

        I visited this place few times past 6 months. My rating is 3-4 stars
        depending on the dishes. Most of entrees are pretty good, especially i
        liked their seafood japchee (vermicelli), and casseroles.Their sushi or
        sashimi  course is just decent at their price point. I like their
        service and outdoor patio during winter. By the way, their side dishes
        are great!

  barbecue and other classics at this spot, often noting the helpful service and
  generous portions that make meals feel satisfying and authentic. While most
  diners rave about the flavorful dishes like grilled fish and stews, along with
