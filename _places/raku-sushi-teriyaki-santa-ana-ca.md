        This place is an absolute disgrace. They are *not* ADA compliant—my
        wheelchair couldn't even get through the door. When I reported it to the
        ADA, we still tried to give them a chance, asking if they could
        accommodate us at the outdoor table. But instead of being helpful, they
        made us wait while they phoned someone, just to decide whether they
        could even serve us outside.


        We chose to be patient and understanding, but that was clearly a
        mistake. After a ridiculous wait, they finally agreed to seat us, only
        to botch our order completely. We ordered two black ramens and a
        tonkatsu ramen, but they managed to give us something we didn’t order,
        and what we did get was bland, missing all the extras we paid for—bok
        choy, extra mushrooms, extra noodles.


        To top it all off, the bill was over $100, and we were treated like an
        inconvenience the entire time. The server was visibly angry, glaring at
        us throughout the meal.


        The only saving grace was the sushi, which was excellent. But honestly,
        who cares when everything else—ramen, service, and accessibility—was a
        total disaster? This place is not worth your time or money.

        Americanized sushi. They used a lot of minced fish which it is a sign of
        not the best quality in the fish, however the fish tasted fresh. The
        rolls were falling apart, not a good sign either. The waitress forgot a
        plate we ordered, never brought napkins for the table nor chopsticks, I
        had to grab those from other tables. Brought the bill but didn’t come to
        pick up the card, so I had to take it to them.

        Nice little Japanese restaurant with ramen, sushi and teriyaki. Friendly
        service and great prices. I had the spicy tankatsu ramen and a
        California roll. Both were very tasty. Recommended.

        We went there with my wife for lunch and it was amazing. Very delicious
        sushi. It’s a small cute place with great sushi. Highly recommend it. We
        ordered Backed salmon, spicy crunchy roll and crunchy dragon roll. The
        only issue I had was that the way the restaurant is situated you get a
        lot of sun light into the store. It was a bit blinding lol. But that’s
        okay, for this food I will go and have sushi with my sun glasses.

        my server but she was great! The server is kind and knowledgeable.
