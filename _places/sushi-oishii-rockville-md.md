        I was wondering why this roll wasn't spicy, since it said it is Jalapeño
        peppers, but they tasted more like green peppers. Well I opened the
        entire roll and they definitely 100% used green peppers instead
        (cheaper?). It's too bad because the food wasn't bad, but why lie to
        your customers? I paid for Jalapeno, not green peppers. Sad that this
        was my first time trying them.

        entire roll and they definitely 100% used green peppers instead
        (cheaper?). It's too bad because the food wasn't bad, but why lie to
        your customers? I paid for Jalapeno, not green peppers. Sad that this
        was my first time trying them.

        The sushi and other side dishes are extremely delicious and a very good
        quality. Sashimi very fresh, and presentation of all the food is
        exquisite. Service is exemplary; they are always clearing the table and
        taking your orders. Overall the restaurant has a very nice ambience and
        is a place worth coming to!

        All the dishes were well presented and very delicious. The food is a
        10/10 and I would definitely recommend. The service was excellent and
        they took very good care of me.  The price is very cheap and it’s a good
        deal. Overall I really enjoyed the experience and I would totally come
        here again.

        Sushi Oishii in Rockville is a hidden gem that more people need to know
        about! From the moment you step inside, you’re greeted with warmth and
        hospitality that set the tone for an exceptional dining experience. The
        servers Amy, May, and Qian deserve special recognition for their
        exemplary service, dedication, and attention to detail. Each of them is
        attentive, accommodating, and somehow always available at a moment’s
        notice, making you feel well taken care of throughout the meal.


        The food at Sushi Oishii is beyond impressive. The Chicken Katsu and
        Chicken Tempura are cooked to perfection—crispy, flavorful, and
        absolutely delicious. The Sushi menu is a delight and customizable, with
        each piece expertly crafted, fresh, and a pleasure to savor. The chefs
        here clearly know their craft, and the high quality of the food shows in
        every dish. My favorite Sushi is the Shrimp Tempura, Crystal Roll,
        Dragon Roll and the Godzilla Roll (even though I typically don’t like
        raw tuna)


        The atmosphere at Sushi Oishii is calm and inviting, striking the
        perfect balance. It’s never overcrowded, which enhances the relaxed
        ambiance and allows you to enjoy your meal without the hustle and bustle
        found in other places. This attention to creating a comfortable setting
        makes it a standout among sushi restaurants.


        This place truly deserves much more recognition for both its food and
        service. Every person working here is top-notch, and I can’t recommend
        Sushi Oishii highly enough, please come here if you’re looking for great
        sushi, service, hospitality, environment and overall good food and good
        time!

        Was looking for a local sushi joint that had late hours, and this place
        was open till 10. It wasn't busy at all when I arrived, only one other
        table, but the weather was lousy. I was greeted quickly, seated and
        welcomed. The menu is really quite expansive, but my tastes are simple.
        I got a bowl of Miso Soup, a Philly Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll with crunch
        added, and their Godzilla specialty roll. The soup was good, although it
        could've been hotter. The rolls were just as expected, with the Godzilla
        roll being deep fried, unusual, but tasty. My server checked on me
        multiple times, refilling my soda and water each time. My bill came to
        about $40. Would definitely return.
