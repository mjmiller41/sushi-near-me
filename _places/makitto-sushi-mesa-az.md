        Love this place! Servers always so friendly, food is always delicious
        and the lunch specials are priced really fairly in my opinion. We tend
        to eat a lot so our bill is on the higher end. Out of all the sushi
        places we've been to this is our favorite! Plus their holiday acholic
        drinks are delish. Always recommend but be aware it is a small place so
        on a busy night anything more than 4 I'd call Ahead to make sure they
        can accommodate you.

        We placed a Sushi order for pick up as first time customers. They dont
        do delivery and i was super ok with that. The food was ready quickly.
        The service was really good and at that point. It looked like I had
        found my new sushi spot. Then I tried the food. The rolls were dry and
        didn't stay together very well. They gave us plenty of Soy and Ginger
        but the portion of Wasabi hurt my feelings. I got 2 basic rolls and was
        not impressed with either. The wife wasn't happy with her roll either.
        Even tho these were the "peanut butter and Jelly" of Sushi. It looked
        great but lacked any real flavor. We won't be coming back.

        Wow!! The sushi was fantastic and the server was spot on. We went for a
        friends birthday dinner and did the chefâs special as well as lots of
        rolls. Every single item was delicious. They donât serve alcohol right
        now as they are waiting for their liquor license but the food was so
        fantastic I canât wait to come back.

        Definitely one of the best hidden gems for sushi.  Everything about this
        place is wonderful.  I wanted to say it was horrible, and to not come
        here, so I could keep it to myself and the regulars that eat here, but
        that wouldn't be fair to the owners, and I'd love to see them succeed
        and grow.  You really won't be disappointed if you come here.  It's a
        great date night spot especially.
