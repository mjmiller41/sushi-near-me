        Wow!!!  In from Des Moines and ordered here based on other reviews and
        wanted to try the Bei Stuffed Mushrooms. The reviews didn’t disappoint.
        I’m sad to leave since I can’t eat Bei Sushi Express again until my next
        visit.


        The Bei Stuffed Mushroom  Mushrooms are a must that you can thank me
        later for. The Rolls Royce and Las Vegas Rolls were delicious too.
        Overall, excellent choice for sushi based on all the reviews I read.

        I went there just before close on Friday night and ordered take-out at
        the kiosk. The store abiance was very cold, uninviting, and procedural,
        so it seemed better to leave with the food than to hang around (even
        better to eat in the vehicle than inside). There was very minimal
        interaction with the employees in the front. They seemed to be
        underutilized, bored, and anxious, because they had to stand there
        helplessly waiting for the orders to be prepared while trying to avoid
        eye contact with the growing line of customers waiting for their orders.
        It was apparent that I should have ordered in andvance, because the
        other customers that artived after me were served before I was. I saw my
        miso soup and edamame sitting on the counter at least 5-10 minutes
        before the rest of my order was ready, and I worried that they would be
        cold when I got them. When my food was finally ready 20-25 minutes after
        arrival, I took my order to the car and watched the employees clean up
        while I ate. The edimame was nicely warm and plentiful but a little
        undercooked. I ate them after the rest of the meal and was glad that I
        had ordered them, because they helped to fill me up. The soup was
        lukewarm but gladly not cold. It was a small serving for the $4.50 price
        and not a satisfying item, because it was not hot enough and had no
        tofu. The Yellowtail sashimi was delivious and fresh. I enjoyed every
        bight. The california roll was very good especially for the price of
        $6.50: definitely a solid choice both times I have been there. The bored
        wmployees in the front were very reliable at the job of preparing the
        orders with napkins, chopsticks, soy sauce, ginger, wasabi, and packing
        up the orders. I will definitely get the edamame and california roll
        next time and order ahead!

        Went at an off time of day, practically empty but I really enjoyed the
        food and atmosphere was clean yet colorful and fresh looking. Kiosk
        ordering but cashier was helpful. Standard sushi prices.

        Modern, trendy sushi place with some unique combinations.  Place order
        on 1 of 2 monitors.  Select from the sliding menu, which rolls out to
        more choices as you slide left. Pay at screen or cashier.  Wait for your
        name to be called.


        The vegetable section has a colorful array of sushi.  The Vegetable Roll
        was good with the pickled burdock root, giving it a nice crunch.  The
        tofu dried wrap was nice with lettuce and rice, simple.  The mushroom
        roll was a rice Vegetable Roll of sorts covered with sautéed button
        mushroom in a light brown sauce.  I liked this off setting the other
        rolls.


        The Wasabi was extra zingy, the usual pickled ginger is represented as
        awatery sauce, and the soya sauce came in a packet.


        Easy parking and easy to drive into and out of.  Great staff with
        friendly smiles.

        A perfect example of a 4. The sushi is good not GREAT but the price is
        right. Service is hit or miss depending upon your server. Sometimes I'd
        rather their robot server lol. But incredible portions for the cost and
        the location is clean. Rarely too busy.


        My biggest gripe is that it can be slow but I will keep coming back.
