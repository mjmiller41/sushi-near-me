        Kind of a no-frills place. I got the creek poke bowl which was bland and
        meh. Couldve used more sauce, or something. In the pic I provided it has
        a lot of soy sauce on it to do something for it. Maybe even some
        sambal..some type of spice.. It was pretty plain Jane raw fish with a
        little bit of avocado small bits of leaves of something or another, on
        top of a bed of white rice which could have been stickier. Maybe I just
        got the wrong thing, but I asked him if that was his most popular bowl,
        and he said yes. The fish seem to be in decent quality...if only colder,
        and to be honest it tasted better whenever I got home and put my own
        spin on it with chilies and sauce without the lettuce after I rinsed the
        fish off of whatever sauce they had on it and the over used soy sauce,
        and tossed some zucchini around in a pan with sesame oil. To add to it
        after I took out the freezer.


        I'd say it wouldn't be bad to try for takeout and maybe try to find
        something you like... I'll probably try it again and adjust my rating.
        Till then they're most popular bowl was not very popular with me. I gave
        a 4 for food, but the lack of service and the place looking like a
        Chinese takeout dive throws off the whole vibe. Decorate the inside and
        do more then take my order and go back to the back never to return.

        Also, I was thirsty this day and they sell 6oz baby waters for
        $1....what am I a toddler? That is super cheap in my eyes. You can buy a
        huge pack of water from Sam's club for like three bucks. You can still
        charge a dollar for a full size bottle of water... Honestly that's what
        really took me, Not just the bad service, or the horrible looking
        atmosphere of a dive which makes me question the cleanliness of the
        establishment. Yeah. My rating isn't going to change on second thought.
        As for the other reviews and pics...some people must be easier to
        please.

        My fiancée and I went here for our dinner sushi fix in hopes of a quiet
        place, and got exactly what we wanted! Walking in, it’s quiet and the
        gentleman working was also very very kind. We are very used to the Sushi
        Bar, so the prices here are amazing, so we were NOT expecting fresh
        rolls!


        Super good, and we are VERY glad we stopped here!

        I moved to OKC about a year ago and I love sushi and I'm very picky
        since I've tried some of the best sushi living abroad. For some reason,
        this place is empty when they have some of the best sushi around for
        some of the best prices I've ever seen. $12 for a massive poke filled to
        the brim with salmon? Steal. 3 massive nigiris for $6? Steal. I
        absolutely LOVE salmon and this place has some of the highest quality
        salmon I've tried, even better than some extremely expensive sushi
        spots. This place honestly needs more love from customers around town
        and should have nore traffic. At least give it a shot, especially if you
        love salmon dishes, great prices, and generous portions.

        I’ve had a few poke bowls from here, which is all I’ll typically get.
        But I just had the hula bowl with spicy and sushi sauce. It was the very
        best yet and all the fish was melt in your mouth perfect! I love this
        place!
