        Impressed with the carefully and mindfully crafted menu. Great sake
        selection to pair with the food. Service was excellent. Every course was
        explained to us well. Ambience was great with non-intrusive music in the
        background


        We were there to celebrate mom's 81st birthday. They played a nice
        version of "Happy Birthday" on their audio system for her! Totally
        unexpected

        The service was very very good.  Food was good as expected.  We liked
        the uni/salmon roe nigiri, the special chawamushi, and grilled misi sea
        bass.  We celebrated a family member birthday there; enjoyed much.

        A great Japanese restaurant in the Milpitas area where you don't find
        many fine dining restaurants. Food was awesome and service was great.
        The chef is young but talented. Food is fresh and well presented. Worth
        visiting again.

        I had a really great experience! The service was warm and the ambience
        relaxing and intimate. The food was beautiful, delicious, had great
        variety, and was well paced. About $150pp pre tax/tip and you'll leave
        feeling comfortably full and happy!


        The chawanmushi and sushi rice in the nigiri were my favorites 😋

        A beautiful small space, cozy, zen and classy! We dined with our infant
        at the 5pm seating so they were quite accommodating in giving us a big
        table. Service was great. Our server was really attentive and explained
        the courses well.

        We loved their soy sauce made in-house by their chef! It felt special,
        top notch, and paired so well with their sashimi. All the courses were
        presented well and were paced appropriately. No dead-time between
        courses and we appreciated that since we had a small baby with us.

        The first course Sakizuke was a big wow for us! The scallops and
        monkfish liver were my favorite. All the courses following that were
        delightful, we loved the light and refreshing taste in most of them. My
        husband added the Supplement (uni, wagyu, otoro) to his serving, but we
        thought it was quite expensive since it came with one piece each and we
        didn’t know our Nigiri would come with uni and otoro already. The
        yakimono (grilled miso sea bass) were a bit too salty for our taste.
        Dessert was decent but not as impressive as the other courses.

        It was our first kaiseki experience and we were quite pleased overall.
        The price of $148 per person is reasonable at nice restaurants nowadays
        in my opinion. Good food, great space, a memorable meal to celebrate a
        special occasion.
