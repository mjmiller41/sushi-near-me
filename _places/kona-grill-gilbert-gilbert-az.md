        We were pleasantly surprised by the kids’ meals. The portion sizes were
        generous, and the cute bear-shaped orange garnish was such a thoughtful
        touch. For just $8, it’s truly a great value—highly recommended for
        families!


        From the happy hour menu, we tried the Macadamia Popcorn Chicken. While
        it had a nice presentation, we found it a bit over-fried and dry, and
        the dipping sauce was heavier than expected. The Sushi Roll was decent
        but didn’t particularly stand out. On the other hand, the Chicken &
        Shrimp Lettuce Wraps were flavorful and enjoyable. The highlight of the
        evening was definitely the Kona Sliders—the freshly seared meat and
        perfectly warmed buns made them absolutely delicious!


        The overall environment was clean and inviting, though the lighting was
        a bit dim for our preference. The restrooms were spotless and
        comfortable, which we appreciated.

        I recently ordered takeout from Kona Grill, and I have to say, I feel
        completely ripped off. I got the fish and chips for a staggering $41,
        expecting at least a decent portion and quality. What I actually
        received was an insultingly small, unappetizing meal that looked more
        like a snack than a full entrée.

        The fish was overcooked, dry, and greasy, and the fries were lukewarm
        and limp by the time I opened the container. For takeout, where you
        already lose some of the freshness from dining in, you’d expect the
        restaurant to compensate with generous portions and careful
        packaging—but nope, not here.

        The portion size was a joke. I’ve had better, bigger, and far cheaper
        fish and chips from casual spots and pubs. There is absolutely no
        justification for charging $41 for what they sent me.

        To make matters worse, when I called to express my disappointment, I was
        met with indifference. Overpriced, underwhelming, and totally not worth
        it. If you’re thinking of ordering takeout from Kona Grill, do yourself
        a favor and go somewhere else.

        I recently visited Kona Grill in Gilbert and had a great experience! I
        started with the calamari and tried a few happy hour bites like the
        satay chicken and sliders. Everything was delicious, especially the
        sliders—the beef was so flavorful. While the regular menu items are a
        bit on the pricier side, the happy hour deals are very reasonable. The
        cozy ambiance makes it a great spot to hang out with friends or loved
        ones. The drinks were also amazing! Highly recommend checking this place
        out.

        So I would say the place is definitely a higher end version of a typical
        Hawaiian restaurant. It’s that Hawaiian fusion style, which does include
        sushi and now they have a brunch which includes things like breakfast
        burritos, and pancakes to cater for weekends. I would say the quality of
        the meats are very high end.  The staff and service match the quality of
        the food, my favorite thing might actually be that butter cake .. that
        thing is amazing. I loved their loco moco and the drinks are outstanding
        too!
