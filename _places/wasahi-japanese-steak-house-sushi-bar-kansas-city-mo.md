        This is Kansas City's best hibachi grill in the Northland. Wasahi has
        always placed quality of their food as their priority.

        I've tried other hibachi places near the MCI airport off of I-29 and
        Barry Road locations, but flavor wise, this is the top place.

        I strongly recommend for date nights, friends catching up, small
        celebrations and parties.

        Best thing is their staff doesn't change very much, so they'll remember
        you. Great refreshment prices and wonderful sushi options too.

        I must admit, as much as I like to do reviews. I kind of feel guilty for
        telling people about this place. I know it may seem like another Hibachi
        Sushi place, but there is a sushi chef here named Vam that will
        absolutely take care of you. He knows what to recommend and will perform
        magic right in front of you. Besides an impressive Sushi list, they also
        have some amazing appetizers and main dishes. I highly highly recommend
        the tempura vegetables and the quail egg shots with your rolls. Make
        sure you also get some sake to go along with your experience that the
        staff will serve you with

        We celebrated an 18th birthday this week and we’re not disappointed. The

        ingredients. We will be back!

        Small Japanese hibachi restaurant with table side cooking. They offer a
        kids menu, which was a perk for us! Soup and salad didn't taste great. 
        We were expecting miso soup but it tasted like diluted chicken bouillon
        with raw mushrooms and noodles. The salad was drenched in dressing. The
        food prepared table side, however, is VERY good with an amazing price
        point. It's so much food! You will go home with leftovers unless you're
        eating after running a marathon.


        The chef really entertained the kids. We had a great time.

        Service was great, we were seated expeditiously and my Bloody Mary was
        brought within minutes. Their foreign beer selection was also great and
        delicious. Steak was ordered at medium well and well I can say it was
        delivered. Chicken was also tender and my sisters raves about the sauce
        in which is was marinated. All in all we had a great time here
        celebrating my sister’s birthday even though we did not catch the shrimp
        with our mouths we much appreciated the show.
