        Ok so reading some of the reviews, I was a little skeptical. Yes, it's
        dated. Yes, it's slow. But it's run by a couple that are very friendly
        and we're very attentive. The food was hot, fresh, and absolutely
        delicious! I loved the traditional playing. It was hands down the best I
        have had in a long time. My hubby is a sushi snob and even he agreed it
        was amazing. I highly recommend it!

        P.S. The fried bananas with caramel and ice cream for dessert was the
        bomb!

        I normally don't rate 1 star. Sorry that i had to. Roll was just OK.
        Nothing great about. The special croquettes was not so good either. It
        was just fried with stuffing was cold. The $25 uni was the worst. The
        color was brown ( it should be more like orange if fresh) and almost
        don't want to eat.


        I will try avoid if you can. It was just close to the hotel I stayed.

        A terrible experience, I have to say this store is kind of racist. They
        served the local white guys nicely and quickly. We waited for almost an
        hour and the only thing we have is cold water, not even any snacks.
        Hardly understand this kind of thing happening in the middle town of SF,
        just because we are tourists and don't speak English well doesn't mean
        you can do this to us.


        We just finished the GDC lesson and were so hungry, so we decided to
        stop by here. As a result, we were forced to sit there for the whole
        time. There was nothing else! Whenever I asked the store owner, he said
        it would only take 5 minutes! But it never came! I kept seeing other
        guests, especially the tables with white people, being served food. Very
        mad about this, to all who can see this comment, if you are not local
        white guys, don't take a risk to eat here.

        Good lunch spot. Nothing too fancy but focused on food. Lunch specials
        provided a good variety at a reasonable cost.

        As soon as walking through the door you notice the place could use some
        renovations. The decor was simple, even though some of the best
        restaurants are simple. It had a nice ambiance; perhaps like a small
        local sushi spot in Japan. They were relatively busy for 8pm on a
        Wednesday but only had one server working. The server was nice and
        accommodating although clearly overworked as quite a few tables had to
        go up to the bar to order since no one came to their table.


        I ordered a simple Alaskan Roll and Takka Roll. The Alaskan had good
        flavor and the fish was fresh. The tuna in the takka was perhaps a tad
        old. I finished my meal with a crunchy giant which looked amazing and
        had great presentation. I know I asked for a roll that’s tempura but it
        may have been cooked too long. Still tasted good and filled my belly.


        It was a nice meal but Idk if I’d go back again.
