        I ordered a medium pineapple pizza and was on my first slice when I
        realized I was chewing on hair. I thought it was a cheese pull at first
        but quickly realized it was in fact a hair. I’m so disappointed because
        a friend recommended this place and the first bites were delicious. I
        just couldn’t get myself to eat the rest so I had to throw it.

        If you’re looking for a slice of pizza with a side of explicit rap
        lyrics and a heavy dose of passive aggression, look no further than
        Lulu’s. We stopped in for a bite — instead, we got to enjoy vulgar music
        blasting overhead, while families sat nearby with their kids.


        When we (very politely) asked the staff if they could maybe switch to
        something more family-friendly, they acted like we had personally
        insulted their DJ careers. Eye rolls, sarcasm, and zero effort to make
        the place even remotely comfortable for families. Apparently, asking for
        basic decency is too much at Lulu’s.


        It’s a shame, really — pizza might be decent, but the vibe? Yikes.
        There’s edgy, and then there’s just careless. Do better.

        Delicious vegetarian pizza options that are unique and creative. They
        obviously have meat options too but I never eat the vegetarian style
        pizza anywhere else. Their options actually appeal to me.


        Pizza and sushi always seemed like a reason NOT to go here because I
        figured they wouldn’t do either one very well. Totally wrong mindset!


        Hit this place on your way down from Bogus and you’ll be so happy!

        Very chill, very bizarre...serving pizza & sushi under the same roof.
        But both are exceptional. You'd never know that this little Boise area
        would have one of the best of both worlds tucked in a small commercial
        (Highlands Village) area in the middle of a sleepy residential town near
        the University. Pizzas, by the slice or medium/large, rival that of big
        cities, with nice tangy tomato sauce to cheesy ratio on top of chewy
        crust you can eat on its own. (They go well with bountiful salads here
        too.) Sushi is impeccably made, inventive too (spicy rolls with bell
        pepper & jalapeno), all of your favorites. Staff is equally cool,
        laid-back & nice.

        One of the better pizza joints in Boise! Annnnnnd they have sushi! I was
        skeptical but not only is the sushi good but the pizza is fantastic!
        Great flavor combos and you can even get it by the slice. I can’t drive
        by this place without going in to get a slice of their jalapeño popper
        pizza!
