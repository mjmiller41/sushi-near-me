        Always such a fun experience. The sushi is varied and quite tasty. The
        soy sauce has a sweet taste that goes well with the beef rolls. The toro
        tuna is fantastic as well. After every 5 plates a movie plays and after
        15 you get a toy. I recommend getting the app to see how many plates you
        can do over time.

        Kura was a cool conveyor belt sushi spot which ended up being a nice
        Thursday dinner. Service throughout was congenial and helpful - for sure
        the highlight. The atmosphere inside was  energetic and interior design
        perfectly functional - our conveyor belt completely stopped several
        times during our meal however (there may have been technical
        difficulties.) Food variety was solid, and on average food quality/taste
        was decent but not great. Would come back for the experience, but not
        necessarily because of standout sushi.

        Great customer service, very friendly servers, and kitchen staff are
        quick with the tablet orders. Best to eat during lunch if you don’t want
        to wait too long during dinner time. Don’t be shy asking for a tutorial
        on how to grab plates (rather have you learn how than watch someone take
        the whole thing off the belt, lol).


        To prevent long wait times, especially during dinner peak hours,
        download the app add yourself to the waitlist on your way to the
        restaurant because it’ll make a huge difference to knock some time off
        than waiting in the parking lot. They have a great notification system
        via text to let you know when to checkin at the front.


        Can’t wait to visit the Lynnwood location once it opens.


        Photos/videos are our typical orders.

        I wanted sushi and I got so much more! It was fun to eat in an automated
        sushi bar. I really didn’t need to talk with a human! The sushi and
        soups were very good and the people I did talk with were great. Lots of
        selection and fast service since it is always rolling by you

        Absolutely furious with Kura Revolving Sushi today.

        I drove all the way from Kirkland to Mercer Island to get two $8 milk
        teas — went right at 11am when the shop opened because I really wanted
        them. Took barely two sips before heading to Kura for lunch.


        At the door, staff told me no outside drinks — fine, I respected the
        rule. I handed over my nearly full teas and clearly said I would get
        them back after my meal. Not once did anyone warn me they’d be trashed.


        After lunch? Staff casually tells me they threw them away without
        asking, without informing me — just gone. If they had even a shred of
        basic communication, I would’ve put my drinks in my car — the weather
        was perfectly fine for it. Instead, they wasted nearly $20 of drinks I
        went out of my way to get.


        This is straight-up disrespectful and careless. I will not be returning,
        and I’ll make sure everyone I know hears about how Kura treats their
        customers’ property.
