        This hidden gem in Johnstown CO was a treat to find. The food was very
        good and as fresh as it gets. Our server was so kind and sweet. Very
        attentive to all her guests. The owner was also very kind. Bathrooms
        were very clean, along with the restaurant. There are tables, booths,
        and a sushi bar in the front. Now, on to the food.


        1. Appetizers: rangoon and fried spring rolls. Definitely delicious and
        flavorful rangoon. Didnt seem to be factory because the ingredients were
        fresh and the flavor profile was specific, not bland. Spring rolls were
        good as well. Fresh cut cabbage in them.


        2. Entree 1 was their orange beef with fried rice. The fresh orange
        scent was the first thing I noticed when the food was served. The beef
        cuts were very tender and fried in a typical asian coating. But, it was
        hand made, tender, flaky, and easy on the pallette. This dish came with
        a side of broccoli and orange slices.


        3. Entree 2 was their orange chicken. Reason, to compare the beef to the
        chicken. This dish came with lomein. First lets talk about the lomein.
        We could order the lomein as a meal its own. It was that tasty. Now, the
        orange chicken. I am thinking the chicken was cuts of chicken thigh.  A
        great choice for this dish. Again, the dredged chicken cuts were tender
        and flaky just like the beef. Both entrees had a perfectly gelled orange
        sauce with little orange rind shavings in it. A few red pepper flakes to
        off set the citrus notes. This dish was also served with a side of
        broccoli and orange slices.


        4. Unagi or Eel & cucumber roll: This is a perfect way to test a sushi
        bar. And, I was impressed by the Unagi. It was well made and presented
        well on the platter. It tasted as what you would expect for a good Unagi
        roll.


        I do not usually give 5 stars on a first visit to any establishment.
        But, Little House Chinese and Sushi went above and beyond. If you want
        fresh hand made Chinese, I highly suggest Little House as your next stop
        for Chinese food. We drove over 55 miles to try them and we were not
        disappointed. You will notice we tasted the food before taking photos so
        my apologies, but it was really that good.

        Very clean restaurant with elegant details that feel sanitary. The music
        was soft and pleasant. We were immediately greeted and sat based on our
        preference. We each ordered different dishes (5 total) with different
        specifications. Not only did it get delivered without a single mistake,
        but it came fast and fresh. Our waitress was pleasant and attentive. The
        sauces were unique to each dish and all delicious. Our plates were
        continually cleared throughout our meal and our drinks remained full.
        Such an enjoyable meal.
