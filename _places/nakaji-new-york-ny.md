        right at home. Their warm hospitality sets the tone for the evening,
        ensuring everyone feels special.


        The quality of the ingredients is top-notch. Especially the various
        shellfish. Every dish showcases the freshness and vibrant flavors of the
        season.


        The decor is tastefully done, with a special emphasis on the stunning
        flower arrangements. A specialist visits regularly to refresh them in
        creative ways, making each visit slightly different and adding a unique
        touch to the ambiance.

        We didn’t get our first course until 25min after the reservation time,
        and we didn’t get our first sushi course from chef until 1.5 hours after
        the reservation time.


        Food had highs and lows. Pickled ginger was sliced unevenly by chef in
        large chunks. The unagi in the soup had many bones to chew through and
        was overcooked. Tamago was unrefined.


        Uni, salmon roe, and the bluefin tuna jawline were delicious, and the
        rice and yuzu accompanying many of the pieces were great.

        Our experience at Nakaji was worthy of five stars. The food, service,
        and atmosphere all met the threshold of excellence. Tucked away in the
        alley off the corner of Canal and Bowery, you would not be mistaken for
        walking past it. A sleek wood unassuming door with a subtle sign serves
        as the entranceway. The kind hostess greeted us in traditional beautiful
        Japanese garb. There was a handsome bar with a friendly and
        knowledgeable bartender before the room where food is served. Nakaji is
        an experience of refinement where three generations of sushi making
        inform the preparation. To dine at Nakaji is to experience a subtlety of
        flavors, eloquently combined in a traditional atmosphere, with gracious
        hospitality. Expect a 5:30pm seating to finish around 8pm and an 8pm
        around 10:30pm. Reservation is required.

        One of the easiest 5 starts I had given. The experience as a whole is
        one of the best I’ve ever been. Many times you go to high level Omakase
        and the atmosphere could be a bit tense. At Nakaji, it feels a great
        combination of both high quality service and food together with warmth
        and easygoing feeling. A great mixture. The food was unbelievable, I was
        most admired by the special Otsumami. Very special dishes you don’t get
        to try in many places.

        The sushi itself was so well balanced. I loved how the cured fish were
        cured for perfection. Normally those arnt my go to, and in this dinner
        it was so good. The Anago and the Kama toro was one of the best bites
        I’ve ever tried. I’ll definitely recommend and will return. Value for
        money 10/10. Chef Nakajima is the nicest person and such a professional.
        And the team were both professional with a lot of knowledges and nice
        and funny. Thanks Leila! And chef Nakajima!
