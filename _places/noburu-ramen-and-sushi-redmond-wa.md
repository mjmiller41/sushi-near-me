        Noboru Sushi & Ramen: A Solid Choice with Standout Stars

        Noboru Sushi & Ramen delivers a satisfying dining experience, balancing
        quality with fair pricing and generous portions. It's the kind of place
        you can rely on for a consistently good meal, whether you're craving
        sushi or a comforting bowl of ramen.

        From the moment our plates arrived, it was clear that Noboru doesn't
        skimp on portion sizes. This is a welcome change from some sushi
        restaurants where you leave feeling slightly peckish. Here, you'll find
        ample servings of both sushi and ramen, ensuring you leave fully
        satisfied.

        While the menu offers a wide variety of options, two items truly shone:
        the hamachi and the negitoro. The hamachi was incredibly fresh, melting
        in the mouth with a delicate, buttery flavor. The negitoro, a delightful
        combination of minced fatty tuna and green onion, was equally
        impressive. The richness of the tuna was perfectly balanced by the sharp
        freshness of the scallions, creating a truly memorable bite. These two
        items alone are worth a return visit.

        Beyond the standout sushi, the overall quality of the fish was
        commendable, and the rice was cooked to a perfect consistency. While I
        didn't sample the ramen on this occasion, the hearty bowls I saw being
        served looked promising and garnered positive murmurs from neighboring
        tables.

        The pricing at Noboru is fair and reflects the quality and quantity of
        the food. You won't feel like you're overpaying, which adds to the
        overall positive experience.

        In conclusion, Noboru Sushi & Ramen is a solid choice for anyone looking
        for a satisfying and reasonably priced Japanese meal. The generous
        portions, combined with the exceptional hamachi and negitoro, make it a
        standout in its category. If you're in the area and craving fresh sushi
        or comforting ramen, Noboru is definitely worth a try.

        So very happy we found this Japanese Restaurant! Both dishes were
        delicious! And abundant!  Lots of fresh fish! Broth was creamy.  … I
        should have added more hot spice.  Poke bowl and ShrimpKaraage Ramon.

        This restaurant was extremely clean and welcoming. I had the Poke Bowl
        and Goyza, both were delicious. We also tried the fried chicken dish and
        it was really good. We will be eating here again.
