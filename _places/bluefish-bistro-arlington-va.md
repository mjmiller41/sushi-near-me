        Went for dinner at opening time and there was no wait and restaurant was
        basically empty which I like.  Immediately greeted and sat and provided
        menus.  The service was outstanding, maybe due to how busy the
        establishment was at the time, but nonetheless outstanding!!  Our
        waitress was very kind, attentive, and pleasant.  The food was all
        soooooo good.  Started with the soft shell crab which when delivered to
        the table had a small flame in the middle;great presentation!!!  The
        fish was very fresh , and you could see the chefs making all the sushi
        to order which is great.  Toll sizes were normal size about 8 pieces and
        all were delivered at once which I like.  The restaurant is a little
        smaller with about 15 ish tables so I'm sure it can fill up quickly when
        busy.  Desert was also great ❤️.  Loved the presentation again as the
        flatware was very cute as you can see in the photos.  Best sushi I have
        had in Virginia so far ❤️❤️❤️. Prices were reasonable for the amount of
        shushi and sake that we ordered and would def go back. Must try

        basically empty which I like.  Immediately greeted and sat and provided
        menus.  The service was outstanding, maybe due to how busy the
        establishment was at the time, but nonetheless outstanding!!  Our
        waitress was very kind, attentive, and pleasant.  The food was all
        soooooo good.  Started with the soft shell crab which when delivered to
        the table had a small flame in the middle;great presentation!!!  The
        fish was very fresh , and you could see the chefs making all the sushi
        to order which is great.  Toll sizes were normal size about 8 pieces and
        all were delivered at once which I like.  The restaurant is a little
        smaller with about 15 ish tables so I'm sure it can fill up quickly when
        busy.  Desert was also great ❤️.  Loved the presentation again as the
        flatware was very cute as you can see in the photos.  Best sushi I have
        had in Virginia so far ❤️❤️❤️. Prices were reasonable for the amount of
        shushi and sake that we ordered and would def go back. Must try

        Great food and service. We tried the shrimp/veggie tempura and seaweed
        salad appetizers which were both great. All of the sushi rolls we had
        were extremely fresh and tasted fantastic!

        We spent our 19th wedding anniversary dinner here. We've gotten used to
        going to a well known DC steak place and thought we wanted something
        different this year. What's drawn us here were the reviews and they are
        absolutely true. We got the salmon bento box (big variety of items) and
        3 other specialty rolls with generous amount of meat. You definitely get
        what you paid for. We also had the deserts and they were all delicious.
        Even our daughter couldn't wait to come back again and we definitely
        will.
