        Everything not taste as I expected …

        noodle is sweet but looks tasty,

        miso soup doesn’t taste miso flavor at all  very plain but the Tofu in
        the soup was fresh .

        Spring rolls are too oily .

        And the Tom yum soup is the worst ever !  Just soup add some chill …  (I
        come to this restaurant cause I saw the picture someone post the Tom yum
        soup and looks great!but taste not good)

        I will not back here again.

        The waiter was sweet and the downstairs restroom was very clean.

        The table by the window view was nice.

        Price was affordable with lunch special.

        miso soup doesn’t taste miso flavor at all  very plain but the Tofu in
        the soup was fresh .

        Spring rolls are too oily .

        And the Tom yum soup is the worst ever !  Just soup add some chill …  (I
        come to this restaurant cause I saw the picture someone post the Tom yum
        soup and looks great!but taste not good)

        I will not back here again.

        The waiter was sweet and the downstairs restroom was very clean.

        The table by the window view was nice.

        Price was affordable with lunch special.

        Very professional and hardworking. They were willing to keep the kitchen
        open for me and my party. The space itself is such a vibe and the
        food... the most important part... was good. I ordered the panang curry
        with tofu and it was perfectly spicy, sweet, and well cooked. Also the
        staff are very fast and efficient and work well together. The prices are
        great as well. It's a bit obscure, the storefront. It's attached to the
        Travelodge. Great Thai spot!!!

        ​Stopped by Thai Spoon & Sushi over on Wabash the other night. The vibe
        was chill, and the staff was super friendly. Ordered the Pad Thai and a
        Spicy Tuna Roll; both hit the spot. The Pad Thai had that perfect
        balance of sweet and savory, and the portion was generous. The Spicy
        Tuna Roll was fresh and had a nice kick to it. Spent around $25 for the
        meal, which felt fair for the quality and portion sizes. Definitely a
        solid spot for Thai and sushi cravings in the South Loop.​

        I have been a long time customer of Thai Spoon and Sushi, but quality
        has gone down drastically in the last few months. The food has been
        flavorless and greasy my last few trips. I had chalked that up to one or
        two bad trips, and was willing to look past dips in quality out of
        loyalty to a restaurant I really liked.


        My last order gave me food poisoning. I don’t say this lightly and want
        to be clear that the food I had from Thai Spoon and Sushi was the only
        food that I ate outside my home this past week. Further, my husband
        didn’t eat any of the take out I ordered because of a shrimp allergy, so
        it was the only meal we didn’t have in common - and he didn’t get food
        poisoning.


        I ordered a shrimp pad see ew (picture attached), I ordered it not
        spicy. First off, it was incredibly spicy, which is whatever, but this
        was the first red flag. When I received my order I was pretty
        disappointed, all of my noodles were cut up in pretty small chunks,
        which is strange given that pad see ew typically has long wide noodles.
        Also, my vegetables were in various states of preparation, some were
        very mushy and overcooked, while others were barely cooked. The shrimp
        was fine, but like everything else they were swimming in a puddle of
        oil. My only guess as to why my dish was so spicy, the noodles were so
        weird, and the vegetables so poorly cooked was that I was given reheated
        leftover or at least partial leftovers of food that had already been
        cooked. Please feel free to compare the food I received with what other
        reviewers have posted.


        Again, I used to really like Thai Spoon and Sushi. I even took my
        parents here when they were in town. But, I can’t recommend anyone go
        here.

        Upon entering, there was a person talking to the host. I understand
        that, I waited to be seated. It took a while for them talking and I was
        already hungry.

        Waiting for the host, you can see the bar is busy to the left, and to
        the right, very few people there, seated.  It's a small area restaurant.
        Nothing too big and not a wide area.


        Once they were done talking, I got seated at a very corner. This corner
        felt the same way you would be solved back in middle school, and told to
        go to the corner.


        I ordered my food and drink. My lychee drink came out first and I tried
        it. Not sure what it was I ordered because they took my menu away, but
        this drink tasted as if it was starting to spoil. It tasted as if the
        fruit started fermenting already and they served it to me anyways.


        I wanted to ask the waiter to take it back, but the the waiter, who also
        happen to be the host, decided to spend his time with him phone and
        focus on other customers except me.


        My food arrived. It was a huge bowl. This was probably the best thing of
        everything. Someone on the reviews recommended it, and so I got it.

        Szechuan style. I was peacefully eating and drinking my bowl, while some
        time later, a fly decides to come by and get to steal my food.


        I kept moving my hand to move the fly out of my way. The two employees
        also saw me doing this and they did absolutely nothing to help me. They
        left me for my doom, fighting for my life against this fly who wanted to
        take over my food. The fly manages to get on the table, and contaminate
        my food area, but not actually get in my bowl.


        I am staring at this person, looking at him in the eyes, waiting for him
        to come to me.


        It has now been around 30 minutes, still waiting for an employee to
        change my drink. He chooses to not come to me at all, nor ask me how
        everything is.

        Every time he sees me, he acknowledged me looking at him, and then walks
        away somewhere else. He even gets back on his phone or talks to someone
        else.


        I'm done eating, and I am waiting for my check now. But I have to wait
        another 15 minutes for the employee to come by.

        At this point, I was debating whether or not to get up from my chair,
        and walk out of the restaurant because nobody seemed to be paying
        attention to me.


        HE NEVER CAME !!!   Until a female attendant, serving water, comes to
        me, to refill my cup. Until then, is when I tell her to call the other
        person over to come to me.

        THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN.


        I told him about my drink, and he said he'll remove it from my bill.
        Later, he said it's only 50% off.

        He didn't even do anything to help me about the fly from earlier.


        If you come here, it's best to ask for takeout. Don't waste your time
        with these servers and the atmosphere here. If you can, speak to the
        chef directly to give you your food. Don't get a drink from here.
