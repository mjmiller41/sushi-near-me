        Rock&Roll roll. The cheese rangoons were a great start!

        Amazing sushi and good prices too. I went for lunch special and it was
        very high quality. Service was amazing and fast. They even gave a free
        dessert because it was my brother’s birthday. I can't wait to come back!

        3.5 stars

        It was just an average meal. When Chef's choice on sashimi and nigri
        just means mostly salmon, tuna, and shrimp, then to me, it's average. 
        Cuts and sushi were prepared well, I was just expecting more. The spicy
        sushi roll was delicious. Ginger on the salad was great.

        I recently visited Soya, and as always, I had an amazing experience! I
        have been a regular customer of this sushi place for quite some time
        now, and I can confidently say that the quality of their food and
        service has never disappointed me.


        Every time I step into the restaurant, I am greeted with warm smiles
        from the staff, who are always eager to make my dining experience
        comfortable and enjoyable.


        But let's talk about the food - Soya has undoubtedly some of the best
        sushi in town! The ingredients are always fresh, and the rolls are
        perfectly crafted. Every bite feels like a burst of flavors in my mouth,
        and I can never get enough of it. I especially love their Mexican rolls
        - they are simply delicious!


        And if that's not enough, their service is exceptional. The staff is
        always attentive to my needs, and they make sure that everything is
        perfect throughout my meal. They also provide great recommendations,
        which helps me explore new dishes.


        Overall, I would highly recommend Soya to anyone looking for a top-notch
        sushi experience. I eat there at least twice a month, and every time, I
        leave with a smile on my face and a satisfied belly. Thank you, Soya,
        for always delivering such great food and service!
