        visited the establishment on November 18th on my birthday. The cafe is
        small and cozy. The food is delicious: I really liked the Daigo Shot,
        fish fins and cheeks, good spicy beef, fried breaded oysters - I really
        liked them. Everything is inexpensive and the price is reasonable.
        Unfortunately, I can't give it 5 stars because of the huge noise, the
        shouts of the guests who were sitting next to each other and shouting so
        much that it was impossible to hear each other at the table. It turned
        out that I ordered a cozy little quiet restaurant, but got into a beer
        bar for loud visitors. Conclusion: not suitable for a quiet visit of a
        couple or family for a cozy dinner. Be prepared for the noise from the
        guests and waiters who shout at each other with the regular guests of
        the establishment.

        I could die happy after every meal here. The sushi is so good it makes
        me dizzy. Fresh cuts of fish with the perfect garnish and spiced rice.
        Every single fish they offer is top of the line, mouthwateringly good,
        and new options every time. My family has been taking me here for years,
        and they never disappoint. There is a warm and welcoming vibe from the
        staff, they always love to see us, and give us great recommendations and
        treats every time we go. It’s very cozy in there, and feeling like part
        of the Shoshin family makes it even cozier.

        THIS is a traditional-style sushi restaurant with a
        traditionally-trained (and very experienced) chef at the helm and I am
        so happy for that! For those who understand the interactive aspect of
        sushi eating, this is YOUR place to check out. Gary-san is willing to
        share with those who know how to appreciate the culture and artistry
        beyond just coming in to dine (which is fine too if you’re looking for
        good value as well). The fish is all so fresh and delicious - they have
        a daily special menu with items directly shipped from Japan so you’re
        getting the same quality as you would there. I love saba (mackrel) and
        it was amazing so I’ll share my analysis: not fishy at all, a subtle and
        wonderfully complex flavor, with a pleasing texture that I look for in
        high-quality saba. In short, each fish we had was so distinct and had
        wonderful character. We loved everything so much we entrusted him as
        well to recommend three items by the evening’s end. A final remark: the
        tamago (egg) was so unique and one of the few places that I’ve seen done
        in the cake-style. It was a great way to end the meal, which was
        all-around spectacular. Will come again as a returning customer who used
        to go to the previous location, Daigo. For those who knew him, Gary-san
        used to work there too! He’s back and has plenty to share for those
        appreciative for sushi done RIGHT.

        Great quality sushi restaurant. Chef Gary is an artist. Such a pleasure
        enjoying his creation and interpretation of fish varieties with matching
        condiments and presentations. Each piece of nigiri sushi was unique with
        layers of flavors. Ingredients were fresh and carefully portioned to
        bring out the best flavors and textures. I couldn’t pick which piece was
        my favorite. The special vinegar sushi rice compliments the fish very
        well. Nothing taste overwhelming. Each piece stroke a good balance of
        umami. Started with refreshing Daigo shot (quail egg with fish and ponzu
        sauce), hotate, aoebi, Saba, waygu nigiri, Chu toro, then ventured out
        to Chef’s Gary recommendation for ocean trout, torotaku, butter fish,
        hamachi, anago, uni and tamago. Also ordered kaki fry and ika geso. The
        fried items were light and crispy. If I live closer I would probably
        come to this gem restaurant every week. Staff were tentative and
        friendly. Very good vibe here.

        so excited about their food and sharing it with us. Sushi chef always
        has the best recs. Highly recommend all the nigiri (especially the
        toros) and the daigo shot.
