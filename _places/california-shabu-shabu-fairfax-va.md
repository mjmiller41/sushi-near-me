        I had an incredible dining experience at California Shabu Shabu! From
        start to finish, everything was perfect. Gundum, our server, was
        fantastic—attentive, friendly, and made sure we had everything we
        needed. Duke, the owner, went above and beyond to make us feel welcome,
        and his passion for the restaurant truly shines through.


        We enjoyed the Wagyu, chicken, and sushi—all absolutely delicious! The
        Wagyu was tender and melted in my mouth, the chicken was perfectly
        cooked, and the sushi was fresh and flavorful. The quality of the
        ingredients was outstanding, and the flavors were spot on.


        The atmosphere was warm and inviting, making it a perfect spot for a
        memorable meal. I highly recommend California Shabu Shabu and will
        definitely be returning!

        and his passion for the restaurant truly shines through.


        We enjoyed the Wagyu, chicken, and sushi—all absolutely delicious! The
        Wagyu was tender and melted in my mouth, the chicken was perfectly
        cooked, and the sushi was fresh and flavorful. The quality of the
        ingredients was outstanding, and the flavors were spot on.


        The atmosphere was warm and inviting, making it a perfect spot for a
        memorable meal. I highly recommend California Shabu Shabu and will
        definitely be returning!

        Great night out as usual @ California Shabu Shabu. Party of five with
        two little ones and everyone was very pleased. Went with the Prime Rib
        Eye which never disappoints. Highly recommended if you’re looking for
        great tasting Japanese hotpot with a relaxed atmosphere that is never
        stuffy or pretentious. Great spot to watch sports too!

        Shabu Shabu is a type of hot pot dish in which you dip meat slices and
        vegetables into boiling water, season them to your liking, and enjoy
        them. This type of food is perfect for a cold day. We had Shabu Shabu at
        this restaurant and found it to be delicious. We also enjoyed the
        appetizers we ordered. However, it's not an all-you-can-eat hot pot
        place and we felt that the portion sizes were a bit small for the price.

        They have happy hour that last until 7pm so you can drinks and
        appetizers. The shabu shabu experience was average at best. The beef
        quality isn't the highest and you only get five slices, granted is a
        pretty big slice, for regular option. You can also get the large option.
        It also comes with a bowl of rice and veggies and a small portion of
        udon. And they charge for each additional meat portion. Also unless you
        choose the traditional broth, all the other broth is $3 extra. This is
        why I can't justify the price here I could get very similar unlimited
        meats and more food selections in most hot pot places. And they are also
        individual pot with a variety of broth and no extra cost. I can't find
        anything special here that I can't get in one of the many all you can
        eat hot pot in the area.for similar or less price range. We were there
        on a Friday night and it was pretty quiet so there's just not that vibe
        in the restaurant either.
