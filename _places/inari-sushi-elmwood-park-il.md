        nice atmosphere, lots of couples and families. the wait isn’t bad.
        garlic edamame was delicious, very garlicky for garlic lovers. the hot
        and sour soup was a little disappointing, extremely hot (temperature)
        and was a sort of egg drop soup with lots of bell peppers. the miso soup
        was what you would expect and very good. sushi rolls (maki) were
        delicious and we took home leftovers. the sake is 1/2 price on mondays
        for a bottle (which is like 1/3 of the volume of a normal bottle of
        wine). we enjoyed ourselves and would come back if in the area.

        Great lunch special! Got the shrimp tempura with rice, salad, miso soup
        & Cali roll for $16! Food came out fast, service was nice & parking was
        free. Will definitely come back for lunch next time I’m in the area

        I ordered four rolls here which honestly I would great as the one I feel
        honestly disgusting after eating them a lot of sushi places throughout
        the Chicago land and I would honestly probably rate this sushi place I
        have been too. it was white and fat, which I ordered tuna so I don’t
        understand why it was white. They probably will not be going to
        restaurant not to mention we ordered flaming dragon, which comes out on
        fire. My stroller was sitting next to the table, and the flames were
        hurling into, the stroller because we were sitting outside and it was a
        tad bit could’ve been very bad for me and my newborn definitely need to
        be more aware bringing out flaming dishes (The picture after I move my
        stroller from the table) not to mention all the pieces of sushi were
        super thick and not properly cut. Sushi is supposed to be thin and not
        super bulky and chewy.

        Very nice restaurant! Came for lunch on a Monday, so not the most
        popular time, the place was pretty empty. However, the service was great
        and food was delicious! I ordered an udon w tempura and my mom ordered a
        tempura plate. We both enjoyed it very much, it was fried very well and
        not overly oily. Would be happy to come again!
