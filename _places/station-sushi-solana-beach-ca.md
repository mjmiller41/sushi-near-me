        My girlfriend introduced me to this place. She has been coming here for
        probably 15+ years. There’s a reason it’s been a local favorite for so
        long. The service was quick and the food was really good. They also had
        a lot of excellent vegan options. I tried two rolls and it was plenty of
        food. The happy hour is also really great on week days.

        My friend and I stopped by here after wine at Carruth. We we're creating
        some sushi and run luck to find the spot! There's plenty of seating in
        the service was superintendent. We ordered a few rules to share and
        garlic edamame?. My favorite role is definitely Ford Roll, which our
        service also recommended. They do have seating at their sushi bar but
        plenty of seating on there heated covered patio. If you're looking for
        some casual Sushi this is a great place to stop by.

        We’ve been coming to Station sushi for a long time probably 15+ years
        and it never disappoints.


        The protein roll is my personal favorite. SECRET TIP! you can ask them
        to use real crab meat instead of imitation crab meat for an extra
        charge. Well worth it.


        The Hawaii Five-0 in Hawaii 60 rolls are also fantastic as are pretty
        much all their specialty rules.


        We also love their salads. The ginger salad dressing is to die for.


        They don’t take reservations and depending on when you go it can be a
        bit of a wait. It’s also a very humble place from an ambience
        standpoint. Rustic and very simple tables and place settings. You do not
        go there for that part of the experience. It’s the sushi first and last
        that brings us back to Station sushi.

        Visiting from Michigan. Upon arriving during a busier dinner hour, we
        were promptly seated and server approached immediately. I saw some
        reviews on here about the service being poor but we experienced the
        opposite, our service was fantastic and server was beyond friendly. Food
        was great as well. Will be back and do recommend!! Photo of the ceviche
        roll, the first of many we ordered!

        The food is good here, and they have a great Happy Hour during the week.
        I recommend the sushi and experience. They also have the most delicious
        macaroon ice cream sandwiches. If you live in the hood, be a regular,
        and if you're visiting, it's a for sure spot to try out.
