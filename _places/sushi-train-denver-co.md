        Went there for dinner AYCE with hubby. Sushi are delicious and our
        waiter is super nice. The selection list is kinda long that it took us
        for a while to decide what to order. Lol. For dinner, we can order most
        of specialty rolls. If not on that piece of paper, you can just write on
        memo area. I think 2-3 special rolls does cost extra but since we have
        so many options, it doesn't really matter. We did order other dishes and
        dessert (not part of AYCE menu)on the top of AYCE. They all taste really
        good. Definitely will come back! The downside probably is inside a
        little bit outdated but food is good so i can ignore that part😝😝😝

        Such a fun and unique place to enjoy sushi. Brought my daughter for the
        first time and she has been begging to come back ever since. The service
        is always super friendly and attentive.

        We accidentally parked in the "back" so we tried to go around to the
        opposite side which we thought would be the front. But it was a side
        entrance. Lol. Upon entering, the restaurant seem dark and dirty. We sat
        at the bar because that's where the choo choo train was that delivered
        the sushi.  We were given a full menu and a paper menu to mark our items
        on. For the lunch price of $19.99, you're not entitled to any of the
        specialty roles unless you pay $3 extra per roll. I won't be coming back
        for lunch if I ever come back. Dinner is obviously the better value if
        you like specialty rolls, AKA the high priced rolls. I ordered two
        individual pieces and the rice was quite dry and the octopus was chewy. 
        The California rolls that we ordered had rice that was a bit more moist
        but still not what it should be. All of the rolls were pretty boring and
        pretty basic for the lunch menu price except for the Hampton roll which,
        surprise, was warm, but it had two different sauces on it that finally
        had some flavor. The fried tempura was heavily coated and very greasy.
        Traditional Japanese tempura should not be greasy. The first round of
        fried tempura included perfectly cooked shrimp, but the second round had
        overcooked shrimp. The edamame was good. The gyoza was okay and super
        scalding as it just came out of the fryer. The chicken katsu was crunchy
        but not very tasty and the beef teriyaki was tasty but a little dry and
        overcooked. There were no desserts on the all you can eat menu. Again,
        not bad for 20 bucks a person for all you can eat but not delicious.  I
        left full though because I didn't want to pay for my leftovers.  We only
        got to experience the train one time. The the rest of the time the sushi
        chefs just handed us our food over the counter which was disappointing
        because we went for the train experience. Also, it didn't appear that
        the chefs were well trained. It look like amateur hour behind the bar.
        Two of them were brand new and were asking very bizarre questions. None
        of the five people behind the bar were sociable enough to even say a
        single word to us. And the two waiters didn't seem like they were able
        to communicate with the men behind the bar. It was an uncomfortable
        atmosphere for sure.

        This place is actually REALLY good! I'm definitely going back. I'm
        pretty picky, but the chefs prepared my sushi as I requested with no
        issues. I loved it. They did a phenomenal job, and the waitress was
        great. Sushi Train has a large selection of food, and the Train toy was
        a plus to see.

        We came with our children for our son's birthday and had a lovely time.
        We were able to sit at the counter and watch the chefs, and see the
        little train deliver our food. They had a half-price all you can eat
        sushi deal for children, and my husband had the all-you-can-eat option
        for adults. We all loved our food and the staff were very kind and
        welcoming. I had some questions about ingredients and the waiter was
        patient and helpful. We will be back again! Thank you very much!

  What Customers Are Buzzing About$$$Visitors often rave about the fresh and
  flavorful sushi at this spot, highlighting the all-you-can-eat deals as a fun
  and satisfying way to try a variety of rolls without breaking the bank. Many
  appreciate the friendly service and interactive train delivery system, which
  adds a playful touch to meals and makes it a hit for families or groups
  seeking Japanese places near me. While the atmosphere gets mixed feedback,
  with some noting it's a bit dated, the overall value and taste keep people
  coming back for more. Folks frequently mention the reasonable prices and
