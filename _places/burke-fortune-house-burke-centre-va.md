        I just had dinner at Burke Fortune House.. so yummy!! You have to try
        the sushi, and crab wonton… Even the edamame was great! Wish I had taken
        pics of the Sushi… but I guarantee it was delish! We tried the Dynamite
        roll, Alaskan roll and Crunchy roll and they were all great!

        My experience at Fortune House was extremely disappointing. I arrived
        around 3:45 PM, placed my order by 3:55 PM, and didn’t receive my food
        until 4:40 PM. There were no other dine-in customers, only a few pickup
        orders, so the delay was baffling.


        When my sushi finally arrived, I discovered plastic wrap in it. On top
        of that, I saw the sushi chef handling various items, go in and out of
        from the back kitchen, scratching his forehead, and then preparing food
        without changing his gloves.


        The sushi itself was a letdown. While some cuts of fish were okay,
        others were not fresh and unpleasant.


        Between the slow service, lack of cleanliness, and inconsistent food
        quality, this was a horrible experience. I wouldn’t recommend this place
        to anyone.

        I absolutely love this restaurant. The food is fresh and delicious and
        always consistent, but even more so, the staff are the nicest people you
        will ever meet. They are so kind to my 3 girls and always engage with
        them and treat them like family. My whole crew always looks forward to
        eating here because it’s a great experience and as a parent, I always
        love bringing my kids somewhere that makes the evening easy. We will
        come back again and again!

        If you’re wondering where to eat tonight, be sure to check out the local
        neighborhood, quaint Japanese restaurant that has authentic Japanese
        food and sushi. The owner/employees are friendly and efficient, serving
        you quickly and offering suggestions on the menus.

        The food is quickly served and is delicious.  We’ve had Don Buri, Katsu,
        sushi, and tempura. Crisp & tasty each dish was loaded with flavor! I
        would suggest getting a dinner box so that you have a good variety of
        food and plenty of it!

        Plenty of parking as there is a parking lot adjacent to the restaurant
        which is found within the Walmart plaza.

        Both kid and dog friendly.
