        Richmond's sushi food scene is really lacking. the quality is unbearable
        at such a high price tag.

        Pork belly bites is probably the most enjoyable dish amount all we
        ordered. it's deep fried so you can't go wrong with it. Tuna Tataki ,
        i'm not sure if this is tataki or they are trying to have a different
        take, very disappointing with too much sauce on it. the rolls are around
        $20 that's really high. the fish doesnt taste fresh at all. you can
        taste the frozen ice pieces.

        Sercice was odd, we were seated outside in the patio and they barely
        came to check on us and had to get their attention to get bill too.

        Richmond's sushi food scene is really lacking. the quality is unbearable
        at such a high price tag.

        Pork belly bites is probably the most enjoyable dish amount all we
        ordered. it's deep fried so you can't go wrong with it. Tuna Tataki ,
        i'm not sure if this is tataki or they are trying to have a different
        take, very disappointing with too much sauce on it. the rolls are around
        $20 that's really high. the fish doesnt taste fresh at all. you can
        taste the frozen ice pieces.

        Sercice was odd, we were seated outside in the patio and they barely

        We had a great experience at Red Salt. The ribeye was amazing with the
        au poive sauce. The Brussels Sprouts were outstanding, as was the
        creamed spinach. The sushi was on another level. I recommend the Mr.
        Miyagi roll! The bar service was excellent as were the drinks and
        mocktails.

        We visit this establishment while in the Richmond area as it was
        recommended as having the best steaks. We ordered the crab dip, filet
        mignon, seafood scampi, and two wedge salads. The food was lackluster
        and  in dire need of salt and pepper with the service was sadly lacking.
        It was a waste of $170 for two people. Me and my wife will never return.
        Food was disgusting.

        My wife and I went here for a date night in March 25. It was definitely
        a great experience and meal. Our servers name was Hope and he was great,
        not a single negative thing to say about him. I wish I could give 4.5
        stars because I'm a slightly picky eater and the selections were a
        little fancy for me. I think there should be some more basics as far as
        sides go. The NY strip I got was great and I'm usually a ribeye person.
        I got the Mac and cheese and brussel sprouts for my sides, both were
        delicious but probably the only 2 I would eat. We had the apple pie
        dessert thing and it was also amazing. Their sweet tea was also perfect
        and I drink about a gallon every 2 days. It's definitely on the pricier
        side but not insane for a special occasion.

        Holly being an absolute joy, we couldn’t have asked for a better night
        😁 also the salad was the freshest I had in forever, everything was just
        delicious, thank you so much for the cooks and everyone last night that
