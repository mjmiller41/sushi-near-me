        Cozy atmosphere. Great food. Chill vibes. Excellent service.


        The food was beautiful and the portions were generous. Service was
        friendly and quick. The spicy ramen soup was delicious and it was the
        right amount of spice. The rainbow roll was probably the largest I’ve
        ever seen.


        I would definitely recommend this place.

        This is our go to place for a California roll. We normally order the
        Crab Rangoon and Chicken Potstickers for the appetizer. I usually eat
        more than my share. I’ve been ordering the B Bim Bio Beef which is good.

        The service is fast and friendly. I appreciate the patience when we have
        brought the kids with us over the past few years.

        The Japanese soda is a favorite of the kids. I take some drinks as the
        dad tax.

        Don’t be fooled by the reviews!! I am all for supporting business and
        don’t generally post bad reviews unless it’s really bad. I really don’t
        understand how this restaurant can get 4.6 stars. Apparently, it has
        been open for 10+ years and only has 230 reviews here. Does that make
        sense to you? They have 4.1 star on yelp and 400 reviews. Either they
        have very little customers reviewing on google or are paying to get
        reviews removed.


        I came here and tried their ramen and Chirashi bowl. They used INSTANT
        RAMEN for their noodles and shredded chicken pieces that were super
        bland. The bowl was $16. I don’t even know what more to say to that. I
        can make instant ramen better at home. When I order ramen I am expecting
        the Japanese ramen, and they call themselves “authentic” Japanese food?


        The Chirashi bowl was meh. Some fish slices were ok, others didn’t taste
        fresh or were cured weirdly. They used weird toppings like marinated
        mushrooms.


        I am a HUGE sushi lover and know the best places in Chicago, so this is
        extremely disappointing. It’s almost like a joke. Still can’t believe
        they have 4.6 stars. Please, go somewhere better unless you are okay
        with paying premium price for 1 star food.

        Staff was friendly, the restaurant was cute, and the food was delicious!
        I got the pork katsu; can’t judge their sushi just yet. But staff was
        very friendly, and I liked everything that came with my meal (miso soup,
        rice, salad, pork, etc.) My one and only complaint is that I wish there
        was slightly more sauce for the katsu but other than that, yummy. ☺️

        I went to eat here and everything from the welcome, the table prep, and
        the atmosphere was excellent! Highly recommended.


        The food was presented in courses and is truly delicious: filling and
        hearty miso soup, the squid nigiri was very fresh and the texture was
        perfect, then I was presented with the avocado smoothie I ordered which
        had amazing consistency and will come back to enjoy again. At this point
        during my meal I felt as if I was being pampered and it reminded me of
        truly sweet moments I had with others, it literally brought tears of
        relief to my eyes. I quickly wiped them off and I was presented with the
        Caterpillar sushi roll I ordered which turned out to be amazing as well.


        Thank you for acknowledging me and for the wonderful time.
