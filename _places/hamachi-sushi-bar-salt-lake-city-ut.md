        So I struggled rating this place a 3.  I really wanted to give this
        place a higher rating but here is why I couldn’t.  The food was good
        except for a few things.  We had the stuffed Shishito peppers, nigiri
        combo and the Shoyu Ramen.  The Ramen had great flavor and for me was
        just the right size, and the pork belly was perfect so good…but the soup
        was lukewarm.  No one wants cold ramen especially on 30 degree days. 
        Please serve that ramen super hot… The Nigiri I was told was really
        good.  Most people who follow my reviews know I’m not a raw fish fan so
        I leave how good that is to my wife.  She said it was good.  Now for the
        peppers which was what ruined the whole experience for me.  The peppers
        are stuffed with cream cheese and spicy tuna and then fried in tempura
        batter.  The tuna was just not it, the tuna should not be in that
        combo.  Seemed to me the tuna was added to the recipe just to add a
        protein, the texture was wrong and it didn’t fit the dish.  I feel there
        could be a better choice of protein if the owner feels a protein needs
        to be in there.  Like a spicy pork or something that will stand with the
        cheese and pepper not work against it.  Just bad choices as it is.


        Beyond the issues stated above I liked this place and would consider
        going back just need to reconsider my menu choices.

        Found this place for lunch on a Sunday! A small and quaint restaurant in
        a rather neighborhood area of Salt Lake City but the quality of the
        sushi took us by surprise.


        The staff was very sweet and kind, she was also very attentive to our
        table.


        🍽️What we ordered

        * shrimp and veggie tempura -- we ended up getting two servings of these
        because how much we liked them! They were fresh, hot, crispy, and served
        with the tempura sauce

        * chicken karage -- honestly by the time tempura and the chicken karage
        came out, we knew this was a good place. Chicken was juicy inside and
        crispy out. LOVED the sauce is was served with

        * crispy tuna tartare -- very fun appetizer with fried sushi rice and
        spicy tuna on top.

        * specialty rolls -- we ordered so many that I weren't able to keep
        track of it. Both Billy Billy and kill bill were great!

        * nigiri -- often times we judge a sushi place by their red snapper
        nigiri and this placed passed the test! The red snapper was fresh and so
        well made.


        ✨Vibe 8 /10


        💵price $40 ish per person


        👤party of 5 people


        I give 9/10, definitely would recommend people checking this place out.
        Whether you're from the SLC area or just stopping by for a skii trip,
        you'll definitely be in for a nice treat!

        Cute little place that has really good sushi. We ate at the bar and they
        made the sushi in front of us. The service was excellent and our drink
        never went less than half way before refill. Would definitely recommend.

        The Miso Ramen hits here! So good and balanced between the broth,
        toppings, and moods. Definitely won’t disappoint! The sushi is also
        pretty exceptional too. The Billy Billy and Volcano were some of my
        favorites. Service was friendly and helpful as well. The ambiance was
        also nice and updated as well and not over the top. My fave place in
        Salt Lake City so far!
