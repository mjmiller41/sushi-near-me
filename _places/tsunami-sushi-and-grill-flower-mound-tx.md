        Today we are here for the first time. It's been in the area for years
        but on a corner in a direction we seldom travel.


        The ambience of the environment was nicer than I expected with its
        Japanese theme and zen-like atmosphere.


        The waiter was attentive and memorized our order which made us
        uncomfortable given how much we ordered. The food came out exactly as
        ordered with large fresh pieces of fish. Seriously the portions are much
        larger than normal and tasted great.


        I am only sad that it took me so long to give it a try. We will be back.

        Good food, mediocre service at best. Sushi was really good, nice
        presentation. There were only two other tables and it was the slowest
        service I’ve had. Server finally got around to us and we waited on our
        drinks for quite awhile. Our food came out all at random. As in the
        appetizers came out with the main food. They got a couple orders
        incorrect as well.

        Probably won’t go back, plenty of other places to try.

        We stumbled across this small little sushi restaurant and decided to
        give it a try. We were seated very quickly and the man took our drink
        order immediately. Service started out super quick. He was not super
        friendly but made up for that with his quickness, that was until he took
        a phone call that lasted forever and all service stopped. The food was
        good. Fresh but fast. However no one working besides the one waiter
        apparently could do anything in the dining area. All other groups has
        left and it was only us left. We were ready to leave for 20 minutes or
        so while he sat on the phone and everyone else stared at us. It was very
        frustrating, they were set to close in 30 minutes for their break time
        and we just wanted to go. I think we will try one of the other sushi
        places around the area so we don’t get in that awkward situation again.

        I got the sushi bento box as takeout from Tsunami and it was delicious!!
        Definitely great value for money, I could barely finish half the box.
        The cucumber salad was really crisp and refreshing, gyoza were yummy,
        and the rolls were all super fresh and delicious. My order was completed
        super fast and it was an easy pickup. I would definitely order from here
        again.
