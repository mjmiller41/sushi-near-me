        Absolutely the best sushi restaurant on the main line. Trust me, I've
        tried them all.  The fish is always fresh and delicious, perfectly
        selected and cut.  The presentation and service is top notch.  When we
        can't dine in, their takeout is just as good.

        If you are claustrophobic or don’t like crowded places, this might not
        be the place for you. The restaurant is pretty small so it gets loud and
        crowded fast.

        The food and services were amazing although hubby is slightly upset
        about getting his shoes stepped on by a waiter lol and took an elbow to
        the back from a customer from the place being so cramped. Food and
        services came fast, and server was nice and went over items on the menu.

        Food was delicious and fresh. We enjoyed every bite. Would definitely
        come back on a quiet night. It is BYOB.

        Maybe it was a bad day? I saw great reviews but… sushi is extremely
        below average. I would say it tasted like buffet sushi. There are so
        many better places with better sushi and better atmosphere in this area.
        SO much rice on the rolls & tasted pretty old. Unfortunately, I will not
        be back.

        Went here for a quick lunch after church with some new church friends
        for the first time! What I thought would be a cheap sushi spot turned
        out to be pretty high-end that makes me want to visit here more for the
        selection of sushi they have here!


        The sushi was scrumptious and definitely made with love and care that
        you can't get anywhere else unless you come here! I ordered the Maki
        Combo for three rolls that were a selection of Salmon Avocado Roll,
        Spicy Tuna Roll, and Spicy Salmon Roll. Because sushi is my favorite
        food, I ended up ordering one more Salmon Roll!


        But the best part about the spicy salmon and tuna rolls were the huge
        chunks of fish inside the mix! Most places would chop it up too fine and
        feels like they could add filler, but here, the fish could be seen and
        tasted. Tiny detail I loved!


        Also the presentation of the food on the plates were beautiful and
        exquisite!


        The service was phenomenal! The waitress made sure everything was
        perfect down to the tiniest detail! She made sure to fill up our glasses
        of water and checked on us often!


        As for the atmosphere, it was filled to the brim with laughs and
        excitement! The restaurant having a casual setting made it comfortable
        for everyone to partake in the conversation without it being too fancy
        or awkward!


        Would recommend this place with a 6/5! Loved it!


        P.S. Visit with friends and family! Makes it so much better!

        We usually love this place. The food is always great and has one of the
        best sushi in the area but we usually order for pick up. Yesterday we
        decided to go so we made a reservation for 6:00pm and we were on time.
        The service was ok although rushed and not very friendly. Suddenly at
        7:05 we were asked to leave, and not even politely, because the next
        reservation had arrived. We had just finished eating, and had not
        finished our drinks. That was just rude, you cannot be reserving tables
        every 60 minutes. Unfortunately we are never going back :(
