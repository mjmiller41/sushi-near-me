        Nice show, but food was no different than any other hibachi. Rice was
        bland tho the noodles were delicious. A tad expensive, but aren't they
        all? Will be back, all things considered.

        Had the absolute worst service. Waited 30 mins. Table behind us got all
        of their food within 15 mins before we could even get a clear soup or
        sushi(boyfriend got all you can eat). Started complaining, they said few
        more mins.  Brought out my food and it was completely wrong. Said we
        wanted a discount atleast for waiting over 30 mins for food for it then
        to be wrong and have to wait even longer. Stood overtop of my food that
        she was just going to hand back to me at the counter to call their boss
        which said 10% discount accept or leave 40 mins later without getting
        ANY food.  Just left. Called to try and speak with a manager or
        something and they hung up on me :)

        Food has gone down in quality and portions, service was non existent,
        forgot part of my order and the next time they came over was to ask if I
        needed a box. Was 30 for this plate, just not worth it. Still good as a
        lunch option, just not worth it for dinner. But I could also just be a
        fluke, people sitting around me who ordered similar but cheaper meals
        got significantly nicer looking and larger plates.

        Every time I get take out, the cashier is always very disrespectful. Its
        been that way for a long time so I don't know if it's the same hostess
        or if they're all like that so I don't want to speak for all of them but
        in my experience they talk very fast and when you ask again they give an
        attitude. As they are talking, they don't even look at you. Then when
        they take your payment they just reach their hand out and rudely give it
        back and don't even look at you or say thank you! How rude! Makes you
        feel like a #! And the food is expensive as it is..we don't need the
        treatment. Every customer deserves respect and they don't realize that
        giving negativity at the point of entry is a bad move! I finally stopped
        going!

        Visited Aya with a group of 14.  We were seated together in a small
        room.  Thw atmosphere was nice, but it was a bit loud for all of us to
        talk to each other.  The food was prepared as requested.  The cook was
        good and interacted with the group.   Would like to return soon.
