        Restaurant Review: A Hidden Gem for Japanese Cuisine


        This Japanese restaurant has been our family’s favorite dining spot for
        over three years, and it continues to impress us every time. The value
        for money is unbeatable, with a wide variety of dishes that are fresh,
        flavorful, and satisfying. Whether it’s sushi, ramen, or bento boxes,
        the quality is consistently excellent.


        The warm and welcoming atmosphere adds to the charm. The chef’s passion
        for crafting delicious meals is evident, and the staff are always super
        friendly and attentive. My kids love eating here—it’s one of the few
        places where they’re always excited to try something new.


        We’ve celebrated several family birthdays here, and the experience has
        always been delightful. It’s also become a favorite for many of our
        friends after we recommended it to them!


        The only thing we wish they had is 火炙壽司 (torched sushi). It would be
        such a fantastic addition to their already diverse menu. If they added
        it, it would truly take this place to the next level!


        For anyone seeking a cozy, family-friendly Japanese restaurant with
        excellent food at a great price, this spot is highly recommended.

        This is the best sushi in the Peninsula!!! Latinx owned and operated;
        the owners give excellent service and their team is phenomenal. Great
        value for a decent price, it doesn’t get any better than this. Highly
        recommend the handrolls, sushi selection, and daily specials (always
        unique and tasty). They let you customize your order, anytime. I support
        their business 100%. Check this place out on your next trip to Redwood
        City, you won’t regret it. They even gave us complimentary ice cream!!
        This place loves their customers

        Ahi Sushi offers a delightful dining experience with a unique twist on
        traditional Japanese cuisine. While some dishes are slightly altered
        from the original, the flavors remain delicious and satisfying. The food
        is fresh, and the presentation is beautiful. The service is attentive
        and friendly, making for an overall enjoyable meal. A great spot for
        sushi lovers looking for something a little different yet still
        authentic in taste.

        Disappointed with the tipping practices (it feels like a scam)!


        I left a generous 24% tip based on the subtotal (which is how it should
        be), but to my surprise, the waiter added an extra $2 without my
        consent. On top of that, the suggested tip amounts at the bottom of the
        receipt were incorrectly calculated based on the total amount, not the
        subtotal, which is misleading.


        I contacted the restaurant, and the owner (he said he was the owner,
        although I think he was the same waiter who attended us) did call to
        apologize, which I appreciate. However, they didn't resolve the issue,
        and this kind of practice makes me feel deceived as a customer.


        Giving 2 stars instead of 1 just because of the "owner's" apology, but I
        won't be returning.


        For other consumers, be careful and review your transactions after
        leaving this place!
