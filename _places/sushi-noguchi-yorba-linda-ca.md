        very fresh sushi, scottish salmon, omakase options.  as others have
        mentioned the stand out feature is the quality of the ingredients - if
        you want a fried rocket drenched in spicy mayo you won’t enjoy this
        place although they do have fried options - this is more authentic and
        for those with some sushi experience.   food is clean and fresh and
        tasty.


        i never had crispy tuna rice where i could see the fresh tuna chunks
        very cool!

        It's been a minute since my last visit, but I dined here recently and
        had a wonderful experience. We made reservations for dinner, and
        everything was set up when we arrived.


        We looked through the menu and decided on some nigiri, hand rolls,
        tempura, starters, and a couple of beers. The sushi tasted fresh and
        well prepared, and the nigiri were decently sized. I enjoyed the Baked
        Blue Crab Handroll and the Agedashi Tofu. Overall, everything was
        delicious.


        We had one child with us; his order was the karaage (fried chicken)
        plate for kids.


        The staff was excellent, and the owner greeted us and ensured everything
        was going well. This is a solid sushi restaurant. with a relaxed
        atmosphere, and I hope to return to try the omakase and other offerings.

        My wife and I discovered Sushi Noguchi a few months  ago, and we quickly
        became regulars, bringing guests here for memorable sushi meals. We’ve
        visited four times with nothing but stellar experiences—until our most
        recent visit.


        On this occasion, we ordered two servings of the sweet shrimp, a dish we
        always enjoy. However, when the shrimp arrived, they immediately looked
        different—an obvious red flag that I unfortunately ignored. I decided to
        give them a try, but the shrimp tasted overwhelmingly fishy, which
        raised a second concern.


        I brought this up to our server, who explained that due to seasonal
        availability, they could only get frozen shrimp, rather than the usual
        live ones. She mentioned that the chef should have informed us of this
        substitution when we ordered, but we were never told. The server was
        apologetic, and the main chef came out to apologize as well, offering a
        50% discount on the sweet shrimp. While we appreciated the gesture, the
        issue was far from resolved.


        Five hours later, I woke up around 2 AM feeling extremely nauseous,
        chilled, and with an urgent need to vomit. I spent the next several
        hours suffering from severe diarrhea, body aches, and general
        discomfort. My wife experienced the same symptoms.


        This was incredibly disappointing, especially considering how much we’ve
        enjoyed this restaurant in the past. It’s concerning that the chef
        either didn't catch the issue with the shrimp before serving them or
        failed to disclose the substitution to us. Given the noticeable
        difference in appearance and smell, it seems clear that the shrimp
        should have been discarded rather than served.


        As much as we’ve liked Sushi Noguchi in the past, this experience has
        left us hesitant to return. It's unfortunate, but I can’t see myself
        revisiting after this.

        Noguchi is simply the best sushi spot in Yorba Linda and we are so lucky
        to have it. There are quite a few options around here and some are quite
        a bit cheaper but none have the quality that Noguchi has.


        Their fish is not only impeccably sourced but masterfully cut and
        presented. You can tell that the all the chefs are quite passionate
        about their trade and it really elevates the experience.


        Their dining room is quite casual and I feel comfortable coming dressed
        up for dinner or right off the tennis courts for lunch.

        It was amazing,  tried both Jun's and Hiro's omakases and they were both
        amazing, definitely the best fish I've ever eaten, and I've eaten plenty
        of sushi in Japan. Also tried their Miyazaki beef and it was also
        delicious, as good as the A5 steaks I've had in Japan, definitely would
        recommend.


        Came during covid and they were very professional and clean. The number
        of people inside was very limited, all the staff was wearing masks, and
        we sat at the bar, where each space was separated by a divider,
        definitely felt safe.
