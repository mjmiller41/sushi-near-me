        Hiro Sushi is top notch, but not in the way that you'd expect. Hiro's
        does not come in as a "high end" sushi restaurant, touting omakases and
        bespoke combo flavors. Rather, Hiro Sushi is more of an everyday place
        where you can visit casually with friends and family to enjoy just great
        sushi. Again, nothing about this joint is snooty or haughty. It really
        is a home-style sushi place where the chefs put their heart into serving
        you a great piece of nigiri and tasty rolls.


        The fish is fresh and thickly cut. The rolls are innovative, but more
        importantly, balanced. The side dishes like the miso-marinated seabass
        are not done in a stuck up way but as if your grandma would've cooked it
        for a hearty meal. Definitely tasty. And you can feel the care that has
        gone into the preparation.


        When you remove the formalities imposed by the structure of making,
        serving and consuming sushi, it really comes down to the love that has
        gone into the entire flow. And Hiro's absolutely gets this right.


        Now is this the best sushi I have ever tasted? Absolutely not. Yes, they
        are great. But not phenomenal. But then again, you do not judge your
        mom's food against a Michelin star meal, yet you love it more and lean
        on it every day. That is what Hiro Sushi nails. It is a very weird way
        of saying that you find comfort in their food but that is what it is.
        There is love and comfort in their sushi's and cooking.


        Service was a bit spotty as they were super busy and some of the servers
        seemed overwhelmed. But again, that's okay. Life's not perfect. And most
        of the times, that's the way it should be.


        If you are in Scottsdale, Hiro Sushi should be an absolute destination,
        more frequently than not. Will return.

        We had an awesome experience at Hiro Sushi!


        We ordered the Hiro Roll, Vegas Roll, and some Sake and yellowtail
        nigiri, and everything was fresh, delicious, and full of flavor. You can
        really taste the quality in every bite. My kiddo had the chicken
        teriyaki and loved it too—it was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.


        The service was excellent. The servers were super friendly, attentive,
        and made us feel right at home.


        If you’re looking for a great sushi spot with fresh food and amazing
        service, Hiro Sushi is definitely worth checking out. We’ll absolutely
        be back!

        They have amazing, fresh fish. The sashimi is refreshing, thick slices.
        I do wish as a first time guest they explained how to order at the sushi
        bar vs server. But that’s minor. The calamari and gyoza were bland. I
        love the presentation of the sushi’s too. The crispy spicy tuna was
        absolutely amazing. Even my spouse who doesn’t like sushi loved that
        one.

        Consistently above all other Japanese restaurants in the area.

        Quality + service + atmosphere is flawless.

        If you are a first timer, sitting at the bar is an excellent experience.

        Go early as its always full and waiting is required, but definitely
        worth it
