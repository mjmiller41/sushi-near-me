        A friend and I went for lunch based off of someone's recommendations.
        The food was good and the music was entertaining. My only complaint was
        that we ordered the chef special combo for 2 and I didn't like how so
        much of it was imitation crab meat and the sashimi were small. If the
        sashimi was larger I wouldn't care too much about there being so much
        imitation but we had 2 imitation sashimi, a crab stick nigiri, and one
        of the chef special rolls was just more crab stick with cucumber... I
        would definitely go again but stick to the chef choice rolls on the menu
        or their lunch special combo.

        Ordered some of their vegan sushi for delivery, and it was just okay. We
        tried a handful of rolls from the vegan menu & a lot of them honestly
        tasted the same. I feel like there is a lot of room to be creative with
        flavors and ingredients here, and they kinda missed the mark. That being
        said - the sushi overall was good quality and enjoyable. Just wish the
        rolls were a bit more distinct & flavorful.


        The real winner of the meal was the vegetable gyoza. Now these were very
        good! Filling was delicious and well seasoned, and they were covered in
        chili crisp oil which was an amazing choice. I would absolutely get
        these again if I came back here.


        Overall it was an okay experience - but for the price and quality, I
        might have to keep shopping around for better sushi options.

        Totally delicious. Great service and atmosphere. We had onagiri, a
        special roll, and two regular rolls. All the fish was excellent quality
        and the flavors were amazing (the sauces! so good!). We will happily be
        back again and again.

        Compared to other excellent sushi restaurants like Shema, all of the
        food here just feels… uninspired. It’s clear the bar is the priority and
        money-maker. Flavors were supremely basic, ingredients weren’t very
        fresh (especially salad lettuce, ew), and the ratio of fish to other
        ingredients in the rolls was kind of hilariously bad. Miso soup was mid
        at least.
