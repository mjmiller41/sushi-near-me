        Wow. The food is delicious, and the service is so thoughtful and kind.
        This was my first time to visit this restaurant, and I will definitely
        be back. Their egg rolls were so light, crispy, and filled with flavor.
        I highly recommend the hibachi shrimp. Next time, I will try their deep
        fried sushi.


        The interior design is minimal, so if you are looking for an upscale
        ambiance, this will miss that mark. But the food! Is a hit!

        Fried rice was delicious, would highly recommend. I added steak and
        shrimp, plenty of steak and 4 jumbo shrimp. Crab ragoon was also good
        and better than other places. Service was fast and decent. Food came out
        fast and recently cooked. Definitely a must try.

        Disappointing.. hardly any flavor to the rice, it was hard or not cooked
        all the way. Had to use sauce and heat it up more til it was soft. My
        son’s rice tasted fine as if his was fresh and mine was old. The salmon
        was so dry it was hard to eat. The veggies were good tho. Our boxes were
        stacked so high in the bag that it crushed the bottom box, I mentioned
        it to the cashier and she just blank stared at us and offered no help.
        The a/c didn’t work so I’m thankful we got it to go, it was way too hot
        inside. Prices were good but I’d rather pay more for something tastier.
        Prolly won’t come back unless this can be made right. We came here
        7/15/24 around 1pm.

        This is the second location that I have tried. I got their chicken and
        steak hibachi which was awesome. The steak was a little overdone for
        what I requested but not inedible. The rice was also amazing.

        The interior is not the most welcoming as it gives kind of a takeout
        only vibe. I also wish there was a description of their sushi rolls as I
        am not the most well versed in sushi, but like to try it from time to
        time.
