        I hate leaving reviews like this (and rarely do), but Blue Hashi was a
        huge miss this time and I know they can do better. The overall quality
        has declined significantly in the last while. Sushi tasted days-old and
        the service was especially terrible. It took almost an hour to get our
        food, our waitress rarely checked in and never got around to clearing
        our appetizer dishes. She and others didn’t pick up on basic needs that
        weren’t being met, and were visibly standing around doing nothing.


        Sticky floors, restrooms without toilet paper, wobbly chairs. Whole
        place needs a deep clean.


        Only redeemable thing was their Hashi-style edamame. (So good!)


        I hope this review helps management get things back to how they were—in
        dire need of waiter training and a cleanliness refresh!!

        Our first time coming here just to try it, but because the first choice
        was short staffed and we really wanted sushi. Everything was good and
        filling. They ran out of the sake when we went but not sure if she
        understood  us since I’ve seen others having them, but it’s ok. The
        service was fast and quick which I loved. It was a bit crowded and the
        cooks were busy nonstop. Nice friendly staff by the way and seems like
        they all love working there.

        Haven’t eaten sushi in probably 2 years. I ordered a to go order and it
        was an hour wait just for that. Didn’t mind it because I was in no rush.
        I ordered tuna roll, another roll for family member as well as edamame
        and some tempura.

        I’d say for a sushi restaurant it wasn’t that great. Maybe because I
        ordered to go. In the 10 piece tuna roll there was a piece of tuna
        missing as shown by the picture. I won’t be going back to this sushi
        restaurant.

        Amazing Sushi! Portions are great (my husband and I both ordered two
        rolls and we each had one left over). Ordered the Veggie Vision (level 5
        spice) and probably in the Top 5 of best food I have ever had. It was
        beautiful and tasted amazing! It was so hot I was shaky by the time I
        made it through all the rolls and would 100% order it again.

        We love Blue Hashi and come often. Not only for its amazing sushi, but
        the amazing staff. A few months ago we came and the owner saw my son
        looking at his car in the parking lot. He came over and offered him a
        ride around the building. It was so thoughtful for him to go out of his
        way to make my son feel special. Can’t recommend enough :)
