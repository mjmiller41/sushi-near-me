        ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐


        I recently dined at ATO Sushi and Japanese Cuisine, and I can’t say
        enough good things about my experience! From the moment I walked in, I
        was greeted with warm and friendly service that made me feel right at
        home. The staff was attentive without being intrusive, ensuring that all
        my needs were met throughout the meal.


        The food was absolutely outstanding! Each dish was beautifully presented
        and bursting with flavor. The sushi was incredibly fresh, and the
        variety of options on the menu made it hard to choose! I also tried some
        of their traditional Japanese dishes, and they did not disappoint.


        The atmosphere was the perfect blend of cozy and elegant, making it an
        ideal spot for both casual dining and special occasions. The ambiance
        really enhances the overall dining experience.


        I highly recommend ATO Sushi and Japanese Cuisine to anyone looking for
        a fantastic meal in a welcoming environment. I can’t wait to return for
        another delicious feast!

        Okay, I haven’t had their Sushi yet, so perhaps I should wait on this
        review, but i’ll edit it when I go back. I told our server I wanted a
        lunch special of several rolls unless she could convince me to get the
        October special, which was a Bibimbap dish in a hot bowl. She succeeded
        😁. Didn’t regret it one bit, though I can never quite shake my menu
        FOMO, hence the picture of my friend’s plate 😂. Anyway, along with the
        delicious bowl, soup, and fried dumplings was a great atmosphere with a
        fun and pleasant server experience. Thanks guys!

        ATO was absolutely fantastic! I love sushi and this was some of the best
        I’ve had. Whenever I go to a new sushi restaurant my test is to get a
        basic tuna and salmon roll to see how their sushi is. Additionally, I
        got the ATO Gift because it’s always fun to try the restaurant’s special
        roll. The tuna and salmon rolls, which super basic, were really good!
        The ATO Gift was incredible. All the rolls just tasted really high
        quality and were delicious. The service was great and the overall vibe
        was solid. We sat outdoors so I didn’t actually see the inside of the
        restaurant but I liked the little outdoor patio. Super cool place and
        great vibe overall! Definitely a must if you’re feeling sushi while in
        Grand Rapids!

        Best chicken fried rice I’ve ever had and the sushi is delicious.
