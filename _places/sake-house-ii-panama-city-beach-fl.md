        Wonderful dinner experience! Delicious sushi the kids gobbled up, crispy
        tempura, perfectly steamed dumplings, yummy pepper steak bento box, and
        friendly service! The owners are very kind and attentive. This is
        authentic Japanese cuisine. We loved it! Excellent value and quality!

        tempura, perfectly steamed dumplings, yummy pepper steak bento box, and
        friendly service! The owners are very kind and attentive. This is
        authentic Japanese cuisine. We loved it! Excellent value and quality!

        I purchased the Shrimp Tepura Sushi roll and the Dynamite Sushi Rolls 2
        times once I picked up and the 2nd time door dash. We'll the  Shrimp
        from the Shrimp Tepura Sushi roll was eaten from the rice roll and
        wrapped back up into the rice with the tails sticking out to make me
        think the shrimp was there and the dipping sauce was just about gone and
        had shrimp residue inside it which is clear it was dipped. Which was a
        dead give away. I think they taking food from the customers that dining
        in and finished and instead of throwing in the trash they putting it on
        the 2 go orders or puttingon new dinningin customes plates. Now for the
        Dynamite Sushi Rolls 2 of my rolls was bitten into and placed back into
        my to go order. I will never in life order from this place again. Of
        course the door dash order they blamed on door dash but when it happened
        again and I picked it up myself I knew what they were doing. Instead of
        throwing the food away of the people dinning inside they take what they
        can savage off those plates and placing in to go orders and possibly
        giving to other people who dine in. It's very impossible to happen 2
        times if they wasn't. And I picked up the 2nd time. So who are they
        fooling. My very 1st time going, i ordered a Shrimp fried rice and i
        literally had 6 shrimp on a big tray of just rice with only onions no
        veggies at all for $17. I didn't take pictures of the 2 orders above.
        Took back both times and they refuse to refund me both times saying door
        dash did it and when i told them about the one i picked up the accused
        me of eating i drove 15 miles to take back both times,  had to pay door
        dash to deliver the 1st time so i lost all the way across the board.Be
        very mindful of what they doing.They're very nasty.

        Absolutely amazing. Wife and I wanted to come here, and found the gem.
        Wonderful atmosphere, and waitress very knowledgeable. The cheif is top
        par, and a 10/10. The salad with ginger dressing was authentic, and
        fresh! All sushi was fresh and great. We arrived about 630 pm and the
        crowed followed. It was not overly crowded at all, but you could tell
        everyone loved this place.  We both actually give this place a 5star.
        It's top notch! Deffinantly Recommend, and will be returning very soon.
        You will enjoy this place.

        As mentioned by other reviewers, the food is great and priced fairly.
        The sushi were simple but tasty. The environment was great, which is
        very important to me and the place is very clean overall. I am taking
        one ⭐ off because the waiter only provided basic information about some
        menu items. I also had a question about some Japanese masks that served
        as a decoration near the ceiling but unfortunately he didn't know much
        about them either, so I ended up googling. It would be nice if the
        employees knew at least something about their place. Maybe I'm being too
        picky but the food is really good if that's all you care about.

        Food was amazing! Prices are fair and service was good. We got cowboy
        rolls, love rolls(my favorite), and California. We also ordered chicken
        fried rice that was absolutely the best I’ve had yet.
