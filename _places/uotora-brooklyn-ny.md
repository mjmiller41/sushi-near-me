        One of the best omakase experiences I’ve ever had. The restaurant had a
        quiet but authentic feeling atmosphere. Highly recommend and will
        definitely be coming back again

        Great casual omakase experience


        Bae surprised me with dinner- I thought we were just gonna pop into a
        place that had oysters bc I was craving them.


        Got the sushi omakase, 2 different sake carafes, and an extra oyster


        The oysters were 15/10. So creamy and flavorful. Not super cold as most
        Western style oysters, which allowed the flavor really shine. The soft
        shell crab was also perfect.


        As others have shared, the omakase arrives in flights, which isn't
        horrible but I see what people mean about not getting the freshest piece
        of each round. I think a bit of wasabi was added between the fish and
        rice of some pieces, which took away from the experience of the fish in
        my opinion. Still, it was very delicious.


        The miso soup service at the end of the meal arrived in a perfect cup
        for sipping. The tiny clams were a pleasant surprise that elevated the
        mild soup. Now I want all my miso soup with clams!


        The staff was all very friendly, professional, and knowledgeable about
        the menu.


        Would return to try their other non-omakase menu items.

        Very nice omakase experience. The place is compact but neat. Sushi was
        delicious. I recommend adding ootoro for an additional piece.

        I lived right next door to Uotora for three years and finally decided to
        try it. This was my first omakase and they were super accommodating to
        my many allergies (shellfish and carrots), which made me feel completely
        at ease and able to fully enjoy the meal.


        Beyond the amazing food, I loved the atmosphere of the space—intimate
        and welcoming. Each time the chef presented a new piece, they shared
        where the fish was from, which added such a special touch to the
        experience.


        If you’re looking for a top-tier omakase with warm hospitality and
        incredible food, Uotora is a must.

        Walked in for our omakase reservation and it smelled like a sorority
        house with the AC out for 3 days in the summer. Straight up fish market.
        very off putting and big red flag for the freshness of the fish. Astoria
        Seafood has all of their fish on ice right by where everyone eats and
        there is no smell at all. Never been to an omakase restaurant that
        reeked like a lake with hypoxia
