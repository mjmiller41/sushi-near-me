        The worst restaurant I have ever been to.

        My son and I went to this restaurant today. The server here had an
        extremely bad attitude. I think she might be the owner. We waited for
        half an hour but our food still hadnât arrived. My son was very hungry.
        I told her nicely that my son was very hungry and asked if they could
        prepare the food quickly. Then, she came over aggressively and blamed
        me, saying that if I was in a hurry, I should have told her in advance.


        At that time, only my son and I were in the restaurantâthere were no
        other customers. She said they werenât just serving me but also handling
        takeout orders. But shouldnât she have informed me in advance, saying
        something like, âSorry, we have a big takeout order to handle, so your
        food might be delayedâ?


        Iâm not the owner of this restaurantâhow would I know they were working
        on a large order? It was their failure to communicate, yet she blamed me
        to my face. On top of that, she kept cursing me in Fuzhounese from the
        back, not realizing that I am also Fuzhounese and understood everything
        she said.

        to treat people properly.

        The worst restaurant I have ever been to.

        My son and I went to this restaurant today. The server here had an
        extremely bad attitude. I think she might be the owner. We waited for
        half an hour but our food still hadnât arrived. My son was very hungry.
        I told her nicely that my son was very hungry and asked if they could
        prepare the food quickly. Then, she came over aggressively and blamed
        me, saying that if I was in a hurry, I should have told her in advance.


        At that time, only my son and I were in the restaurantâthere were no
        other customers. She said they werenât just serving me but also handling
        takeout orders. But shouldnât she have informed me in advance, saying
        something like, âSorry, we have a big takeout order to handle, so your

        Server was rude and not attentive. Food was bland and portions are
        incredibly small. Avoid this place! Never offered to remake anything and
        the server threw the check at us at the end because we said we wanted
        her to take back a dish we didn't enjoy. We also would've gladly paid
        any difference for the price of the item we got instead.

        The food is great but the customer service is so bad it brings the
        rating down to a 1 star. The lady at the front is rude, delusional and
        downright stupid.

        We walked into an empty restaurant on a Friday night and that shouldâve
        been our first clue as to what to expect. The sushi was bearable at
        best. The shrimp in the sushi was not deveined and the food was hard to
        finish. We bought some rolls that were served hot that should not have
        been hot.. the fish looks grey and weeks old. The server was cordial but
        service was very slow, and she was on the phone for the most part. The
        server added 15% tip to our bill without our knowledge (party of
        four..)â¦when she did the absolute bare minimumâ¦Do not recommend this
        place whatsoever.
