        OMG can’t believe they are closed forever (and that I never reviewed
        them)!


        We started eating here during the pandemic (they opened right
        beforehand). The best sushi takeout we had ever had.


        Finally going in person was sensational. What a wonderful sushi omakase
        experience . The chefs were all very talented, personable and always
        worked hard to make sure every meal was special.


        Two pieces we will always remember (and miss).


        1) Their amazingly tender smoked king salmon was one of the best pieces
        of sushi I’ve ever had. Was lucky enough to have it 6-7x!


        2) The tuna tartare with mountain yam. Wow!


        My whole family will miss Nonaka. Wishing the chefs/hostess/owner all
        the best!! And deepest gratitude for many memorable experiences…

        OMG can’t believe they are closed forever (and that I never reviewed
        them)!


        We started eating here during the pandemic (they opened right
        beforehand). The best sushi takeout we had ever had.


        Finally going in person was sensational. What a wonderful sushi omakase
        experience . The chefs were all very talented, personable and always
        worked hard to make sure every meal was special.


        Two pieces we will always remember (and miss).


        1) Their amazingly tender smoked king salmon was one of the best pieces
        of sushi I’ve ever had. Was lucky enough to have it 6-7x!


        2) The tuna tartare with mountain yam. Wow!


        My whole family will miss Nonaka. Wishing the chefs/hostess/owner all
        the best!! And deepest gratitude for many memorable experiences…

        Food was so absolutely delicious and beautifully presented that we never
        thought about taking pics! You’ve got to see and taste for yourself!
        Amazing sushi. Braised burdock root is worth a try, earthy flavor and so
        good for us. I ordered the 8 piece set, I’d do it again. Others in our
        party ordered Tempura and then individual pieces. Moo-chi was a perfect
        ending.

        Atmosphere was cozy and crisp. I felt like I was in Japan.

        This is one of the best sushi spots in NYC. They have both omakase and a
        la carte menus, but the sushi counter is for omakase only.


        Previously, there was no sign outside and it was a bit hard to find.
        Now, the restaurant name is displayed outside so you can easily find it
        on Amsterdam Ave.

        When you enter, inside is a Korean restaurant called Boka, which I’ve
        never seen very busy. Sushi Nonaka is on the lower level, with a clean,
        warm atmosphere and also has lovely outdoor dining in the warmer months.


        I came with my boyfriend last night for dinner and tried the omakase for
        the first time. We hadn’t come specifically for omakase, but wanted to
        dine at the counter.


        The Omakase Sushi ($110+) comes with starters, 9 pieces of sushi, a hand
        roll and miso soup. The portions are on the smaller side, but it was
        absolutely delicious. The sushi here, you eat with your hands, but
        because they are on the smaller side, they are easy to eat.


        My favorite was the uni (from Hokkaido) by far. The chef put a generous
        portion of uni on the rice and it was just mouthwatering. Other
        highlights for me were the fatty tuna (chu toro) and tuna taku (toro
        taku) handroll. Everything tasted very fresh.


        The only thing I didn’t love was that some of seasoning or toppings they
        added to the fish were “Americanized” and a bit overpowering—I
        personally prefer very simple, so I can enjoy the flavors of the fish.


        Nevertheless, Sushi Nonaka is a fabulous place for a nice sushi dinner
        and I look forward to dining again soon.

        When you walk into Sushi Nonaka you can’t believe you are on Amsterdam
        Ave on the UWS. It is a beautiful boutique restaurant with a private
        garden serving the freshest fish prepared just like the most exclusive
        restaurants in Japan. You can’t believe the quality and every detail
        they have thought of (including blankets for the outside seating area).
        We never miss going to Nonaka when we go to NYC. Thank you for the warm
        hospitality and treating your guests like VIPs  without breaking the
        bank, too.

        As an upfront disclaimer, this review is not about the sushi/omakase
        experience here.


        My friend and I came by to try their weekday lunch special recently - we
        both ordered the pork katsu lunch box. Despite there not being anyone
        else in the restaurant at the time, it took quite a while for us to get
        our food :(


        Overall, the meal was passable -- there weren't any glaring problems,
        but I felt that the quality was a bit lacking and that holistically, the
        composition of the bento was sloppily haphazard.


        The katsu tasted fine -- a little bit less tender/hard to chew than I
        expected -- and I did quite like the potato salad. The other components
        were all.. fine? ish? but rather disjointed. Everything felt pretty
        random and in particular the sprinkling of scrambled egg on the rice was
        definitely the strangest part to me -- it had very little flavour by
        itself and didn't really contribute to the rice, either.


        The price point was pretty good, but only after leaving did we notice
        that we were each charged $1 more than the listed price on the menu :(
        Obviously not a big amount but the lack of attention to detail seems to
        have been a recurring theme here, so it still feels a bit bad.


        I probably wouldn't come back for their lunch menu in the future, but it
        does seem from other reviews that the sushi seems to be a better choice
