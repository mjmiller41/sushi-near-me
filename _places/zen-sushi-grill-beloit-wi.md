        We went dine in on Friday, we both know that they are closing at 9.30PM.
        We are from other city( 2 hours away )and sorry that we couldn’t arrived
        earlier because we have to wait for our daughter done school. we arrived
        there 8.50pm and order everything by 9pm. Our server gave us a notice
        that last call is 9.15pm. Which is mean we still a little time to dine
        in (am I right)

        First of all food. I gave 3 stars because food was ok over load sauces.
        Waygu was chewy.

        Second, service… server is nice enough but could tell it did not seem
        genuine but I asked for soy sauce.. and they probably clean already so
        our server gave us a gluten free soy sauce instead maybe too much work
        for them to give me a regular soy sauce.

        Last, when we arrived there.. All the staffs gave me a look like ugh
        “late customers” I get it that why we were rush eating and try to get
        out asap. And we are not plan to go back again.

        We went dine in on Friday, we both know that they are closing at 9.30PM.
        We are from other city( 2 hours away )and sorry that we couldn’t arrived
        earlier because we have to wait for our daughter done school. we arrived
        there 8.50pm and order everything by 9pm. Our server gave us a notice
        that last call is 9.15pm. Which is mean we still a little time to dine
        in (am I right)

        First of all food. I gave 3 stars because food was ok over load sauces.
        Waygu was chewy.

        Second, service… server is nice enough but could tell it did not seem
        genuine but I asked for soy sauce.. and they probably clean already so
        our server gave us a gluten free soy sauce instead maybe too much work
        for them to give me a regular soy sauce.

        Last, when we arrived there.. All the staffs gave me a look like ugh
        “late customers” I get it that why we were rush eating and try to get
        out asap. And we are not plan to go back again.

        My husband and I recently dined at Zen Sushi & Grill in Beloit, WI, and
        had a fantastic experience. He ordered the sweet-and-sour chicken, which
        was flavorful and satisfying. I tried both the Hawaiian Roll and the
        Surf and Turf Roll; each bite was a delightful fusion of fresh
        ingredients and expertly balanced flavors. The portions were generous,
        leaving us both fully satisfied. The restaurant’s ambiance was upscale
        yet inviting, and the service was attentive and friendly. We highly
        recommend Zen Sushi & Grill for anyone seeking delicious sushi and
        exceptional service in Beloit.

        Great sushi in downtown Beloit, Wisconsin ?

        You bet. Just a wonderful experience tonight. Started with an
        interesting take on a Tuna Tataki app and a nice G Joy sake from a very
        decent sake and wine offering … he offered up a custom preparation that
        was artistic and meaty as well. This was followed by the best inland
        Chef’s choice sashimi platter I’ve ever had. Great mix of fish,
        exceptionally well presented. Sat at the sushi bar and had the pleasure
        of conversing with is Japan trained chef who really seemed to enjoy his
        gig in Beloit. Check this place out, you will not be disappointed !

        This was a really good sushi place! Make sure you get a reservation, it
        was packed. The atmosphere was loud! The friendly hostess got us a bar
        seat. The restaurant is cold at night, especially if seated by the
        doors. The sushi is flavorful and good. I got the udon soup and it was
        perfect. Thank you so much!
