        It was my first time at a revolving sushi bar and I had a blast! The
        staff were kind, helpful and fun. We had a team member make sure I knew
        what I was doing since it was my first time there so we got a little
        tutorial which was fun and helpful. The music was great, the vibe was
        fun and happy, and the revolving sushi was dope! How is it that I’ve
        gone my whole life without this in my life! The food was delicious and I
        love that there were so many options Al’s my favorite part would be the
        portions. In many restaurants, you have to purchase an entire roll which
        usually had 8 pieces of sushi. I liked that the portions were in 2 or 4
        so I could enjoy and explore a better variety of food during the
        experience. I would absolutely recommend this and hope to visit again
        soon!

        It was my first time at a revolving sushi bar and I had a blast! The
        staff were kind, helpful and fun. We had a team member make sure I knew
        what I was doing since it was my first time there so we got a little
        tutorial which was fun and helpful. The music was great, the vibe was
        fun and happy, and the revolving sushi was dope! How is it that I’ve
        gone my whole life without this in my life! The food was delicious and I
        love that there were so many options Al’s my favorite part would be the
        portions. In many restaurants, you have to purchase an entire roll which
        usually had 8 pieces of sushi. I liked that the portions were in 2 or 4
        so I could enjoy and explore a better variety of food during the
        experience. I would absolutely recommend this and hope to visit again
        soon!

        Here’s a review you can use or adapt:


        After a long flight, I decided to take my mom out for a special treat,
        and this revolving sushi restaurant exceeded all our expectations! The
        atmosphere was inviting and perfect for spending quality time with
        family. The sushi was incredibly fresh, and the variety of options was
        impressive—something for everyone. My mom absolutely loved it, and it
        was heartwarming to see her enjoy each dish as it passed by.


        The quality of the ingredients truly stood out, and the staff was
        attentive, ensuring everything was seamless. The experience felt unique,
        fun, and authentic, making it more than just a meal—it was a memorable
        outing. I couldn’t have chosen a better place for this mother-daughter
        date. Highly recommend for anyone looking for excellent sushi and a
        delightful experience!

        This rating is for Kura/conveyor belt type sushi places only,  for what
        it is, it's good food and good service. Place is pretty clean and always
        a good meal.  We were sat right away on a Sunday evening and the robot
        brought our drinks and we were off to the races.  We had 1 custom order,
        a pair of crunchy hand rolls that came out hot and delicious, like the
        tempura was just fried.

        I absolutely adore this Kaiten chain from Japan, the food quality was
        surprisingly consistent with what I had overseas.


        Service was fast and the belt was still full of variety even though we
        were there an hour before closing.


        The location itself can be a little tidier and servers could be more
        attentive but we went at a rather busy time during the weekend.

        FYI - you can make reservations online. Do it! We didn't know that was
        an option and waited for 2 hours. It was still worth it. We had so much
        fun choosing dishes and trying new things. It was one of our favorite
        experiences in D.C.  My husband doesn't eat sushi, but there were dishes
        he could order like ramen and chicken that he enjoyed! The robot waiter
        is a nice touch.
