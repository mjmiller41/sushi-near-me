        Excellent restaurant if you judge by the price/quality ratio. Very fresh
        sashimi, great fish variety. Rolls have a bit too much rice to my taste.
        The only drawback is a lack of parking, but if you drive around, you can
        find a spot.

        Excellent! The staff was very kind, restaurant was clean and had
        beautiful art up.


        I had the lunch menu (served until 3), chicken Katsu with salad for $13
        was great!


        Large portion and chicken was cooked perfectly, had a wonderful crisp
        and tasty, tangy bbq sauce. Salad was modest with mixed greens and
        delicious ginger dressing.


        Also ordered salmon nigiri which was fresh with had nice texture.
        Altogether a killer spot, can’t wait to come back!

        This place is amazing! The food is excellent, the fish is so fresh, and
        their mochi ice cream is the best I've had in a long time. The staff was
        also incredibly friendly and accommodating of my disabled dad. Everyone
        was so kind and it made it even more of a delight to eat here. The
        prices are great, especially for the quality and the amount of food.
        Hands down the best chirashi I've had in Denver. My dad ordered the
        tempura dinner with shrimp and said it blows our usual place out of the
        water. I cannot recommend this place enough, you can't go wrong!! After
        being there for not even twenty minutes I knew I'd be leaving this
        review afterwards. Shout out to Liam, thanks for holding the doors open
        for us :)

        AMAZING GLUTEN FREE SUSHI! The only thing better than the food was our
        server Rex. Rex was working hard, constantly moving and checking in on
        tables to see if anyone needed anything. He was a genuine kind and
        smiling face throughout the entire meal.


        Every roll was spectacular in appearance and taste. I haven’t had such
        great service and food in a long time.


        I was pleasantly surprised to find so many gluten free options! They
        have gluten free soy sauce (tamari) and many rolls can be made gluten
        free. Beautiful establishment and staff! I will be coming here again!

        Among the top 5 spots we’ve been to in the Denver area for Japanese
        food. Everything we ordered was delicious and of good quality, the
        service was extremely friendly and efficient, and the prices are very
        reasonable all things considered. We found this spot by accident but
        will very intentionally return soon.

  Customers frequently mention the friendly service and reasonable prices, which
  make it a solid pick for casual meals or groups, even with some feedback on
  parking challenges that don't overshadow the positives. While it's easy to

  a satisfying, no-fuss outing. Overall, it's a spot that continues to impress
  with its reliable quality and vibe, encouraging repeat visits for anyone in
