        We had another wonderful dinner at Little Ginger! Sorry for the late
        review. We are actually going to dine with Michael at Little Ginger
        today! Very excited to enjoy some Uni! Michael texted my husband to let
        him know he was able to purchase some Uni as he knew we were wanting
        some! Thank you, Michael, you are a great guy and Little Ginger is
        delicious every single time! At our last visit, we enjoyed some edamame,
        fresh seaweed salad with squid, salmon, jalapeno crab and cream cheese
        appetizer (so yummy) and Austn Roll. Everything was fresh and delicious!
        We look forward to dining there today and highly recommend lunch or
        dinner when you crave sushi. They also serve many other things, not just
        sushi. Great restaurant, friendly and personable service and delicious
        food!

        Tried this place for the first time today. Ordered a large won ton soup
        and an order of egg rolls for about $11. Picked it up and the hostess
        was kind and gave me my order. I was a bit disappointed in the portion
        sizes, the egg rolls are mini and the wonton soup doesn't seem like a
        large order. The broth has no flavor and tastes very watered down. The
        wonton themselves are a bit overcooked and small. Total of 4 wontons in
        my order. Egg rolls were not my favorite. Would not try this place
        again.

        I really enjoy this restaurant and have visited it three or four times.
        My boyfriend and I especially love the New Orleans roll—it's so
        delicious that we keep coming back for it. I wish I had taken a picture,
        but we always end up devouring the food as soon as it arrives!


        Additionally, the atmosphere and music are quite pleasant, and the staff
        is always friendly. I would definitely recommend this place to family
        and friends. 😊

        The waitstaff are attentive and quick. It is also a nice relaxed
        atmosphere.


        Update:

        We've gone dozens times so far since the first review. Same level of
        service. It's our favorite sushi place.

        They let me name a couple of custom rolls since we get them all the time
        now.

        One's called the Natsu Kashi Roll.

        It is the rice based roll.

        The other is the Kobayashi Maru.

        It's one of the cucumber rolls in the pictures.

        Please try one. I hope you enjoy it.
