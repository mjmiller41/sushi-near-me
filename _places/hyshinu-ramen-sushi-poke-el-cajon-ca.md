        Food was okay but not great. Got a 1/2 ahi and salmon poke bowl. The
        rice was over cooked and chewy but, not inedible. The tempera was not
        fried long enough because you could taste the batter and slightly gooey.
        Fiance had pork belly ramen, which again was okay. The broth was good,
        but the noodles were chewy. The pork was grilled and thrown in, no
        flavor or seasonings to it. Just tough and bland. Sushi avocado was the
        only thing that was as expected. But the experience of it all was not
        geat by the fruit flies constantly flying around our food. Service was
        fine because you pay first and refilled our waters. But all in all would
        only go if in the area.

        Food was okay but not great. Got a 1/2 ahi and salmon poke bowl. The
        rice was over cooked and chewy but, not inedible. The tempera was not
        fried long enough because you could taste the batter and slightly gooey.
        Fiance had pork belly ramen, which again was okay. The broth was good,
        but the noodles were chewy. The pork was grilled and thrown in, no
        flavor or seasonings to it. Just tough and bland. Sushi avocado was the
        only thing that was as expected. But the experience of it all was not
        geat by the fruit flies constantly flying around our food. Service was

        I’m literally still at the restaurant, with my food in front of me, and
        I felt it was important enough to write this review in real-time. The
        food here was actually TERRIBLE. I got the “spicy” ramen and I was told
        it was a 10 on the heat level and it was nowhere near that. The ramen
        tasted like buttered noodles in the sense that it had no flavor
        whatsoever. We ordered an appetizer and didn’t even get share plates at
        the table. My boyfriend got two different rolls and both were super
        bland. I couldn’t stomach the ramen so I will not be eating it at all.
        Would never return here again. Two rolls, one order of gyoza, and one
        ramen came out to $75 and I felt that I was cheated.

        My daughter and I went out to eat her and it was epic!! The Ramen was so
        flavorful and amazing.  The staff was helpful and accommodating when an
        item got mixed up.

        Can't wait to eat here again!!!

        The only thing negative, is I wish they had a soda fountain instead of
        canned soda, but all around amazing.

        Food was just ok. If you know ramen at all, you will not enjoy this
        place. They could have had a bad day but had 2 different ramens, and the
        flavor profile was not there at all.  Shrimp was greasy and soft, not
        crunchy for being tempura. Didn't even finish either bowl.

        Servers were very nice. Food was served fast.

        I had a combo Dalmon & Tuna Poke bowl. It was OK. The fish tasted just
        OK, not the freshest but OK.  You pay first then find a seat and they'll
        bring your food to you.   Service was basically only the food delivery, 
        was never checked on so it's basically a fast food place where you can
        dine in.  I don't understand fast food places set up for tips at initial
        purchase time,  like this one was.  Tipping for service should be after
        the service was performed, like at most restaurants.
