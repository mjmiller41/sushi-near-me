        Authentic Japanese sushi and comfort food. All of their fish is fresh,
        their sushi rice is perfect, and their miso soup is authentic miso.


        We stopped by for lunch and were blown away. Great, welcoming service.
        The interior is cozy. They serve fresh green tea, which is always a
        plus!


        This is the best quality sushi and Japanese cuisine you’ll find in all
        of Princeton.

        Authentic Japanese sushi and comfort food. All of their fish is fresh,
        their sushi rice is perfect, and their miso soup is authentic miso.

        The food was really good, especially for the price! The music was also
        quite nice (acoustic versions of pop songs). Overall great atmosphere
        and food.

        We have dined here twice so far, and both times were very underwhelmed
        with the service and food quality given the price. The first time we
        went, we ordered an avocado roll; but the second time, we were rudely
        informed that they don’t have avocado rolls (and that they’ve never
        served them). You can clearly see the avocado rolls in the photo
        included.

        The server also took forever to take our order both times, and the food
        took ridiculously long to prepare. Both times we ordered ramen, and the
        toppings for the ramen was cold! It wasn’t just cold, it was ice cold!
        Considering we waited almost 45 minutes for our food, this was rather
        surprising. The food was very expensive, and we didn’t even get water.
        Definitely not going back.

        The sushi platter is fresh but a bit over priced at $30. The ankimo is a
        bit fishy and I don’t think it’s as fresh from the color. Sushi rice is
        a bit chewy  and miso soup is a bit salty. Overall fish quality is good
        but over priced. Service was a bit lower than average.

        Please stop and read this before you eat at Ajiten Sushi in Princeton.
        My family has been a regular customer (both take out and in restaurant)
        of this restaurant for over a decade. As part of a recent take out, we
        were given some bad sushi.  I called immediately and informed them of
        this problem. The next time we ordered, we asked for a credit for the
        spoiled item from our last takeout.  They flat out and rudely refused.
        We were told they never issue credits for “alleged” quality issues. The
        chef flat out refuses to do so believing he never has issues. If you
        read many of the other reviews you will see a pattern of shabby rude
        service and questionable food quality. This is a place that is likely to
        go out of business.  Businesses generally don’t survive if they don’t
        stand behind their products.  As a result of this treatment, we decided
        to try another Princeton sushi restaurant and found it to be bright,
        fresh and yummy with much better service.  We will not frequent Ajiten
        Sushi again.
