        Some top notch food at a price you absolutely can't beat. Everyone is
        very friendly and it's one of my favorite places to go in town.


        Also, the sushi chef was playing some good tunes and it's refreshing to
        see somebody genuinely enjoying what they do like that.

        Some top notch food at a price you absolutely can't beat. Everyone is
        very friendly and it's one of my favorite places to go in town.


        Also, the sushi chef was playing some good tunes and it's refreshing to
        see somebody genuinely enjoying what they do like that.

        Glad new owners/management have taken over since before the new year.
        Great quality sushi, friendly and responsive staff. Been there more than
        a dozen times, same freshness in every order. I helped them make a tip
        jar for the sushi chefs, so make sure you tip them on the way out. They
        deserve it.

        Incredibly nice owner whose kindness alone will make you return. $33 for
        3 specialty rolls—I’m not sure anywhere else in Syracuse can beat that.
        If you’re a student on main campus, don’t settle for unclean and
        mediocre quality like Oishi, where the entire place smells like a sewer,
        or overpriced, medium-quality sushi from Bleu Monkey. I’ll encourage all
        my friends to dine here from now on whenever we’re craving sushi.

        Okay, First Things You Need Know Before Going: 1.) You don't need wait
        for them to seat you its a seat yourself place which I Loved. 2.) Empty
        Which is also nice but not because of any reason usually with places
        that be the case but not with them. People just Grub-hub and Door Dash
        Uber eats Here as well thats why. 3.) Thats also Nice they offer all
        three order apps. 4.) People are quiet and Very nice Who work their. 5.)
        They give you the Menu right away ask what you want to drink. 6.) They
        are slow but not in a bad way they have a lot of orders so defiantly
        make sure you have time when going unless you order to go is fast. 7.)
        Was talking owner they are Farley new thats why do not know about them
        he said 4 months and he was really nice guy. 8.) They are trying get the
        hang of it because it is family owned 3 people but Idc because their
        amazing and put their heart into the food. 9.) Patients is a Virtue but
        so worth it the Food My mom Got a Poke Bowl amazing she said and Also me
        Sushi. 10.) TOP RATED SUSHI PLACE IN CNY/ SYRACUSE FOR ME I HAVE GONE
        EVERY PLACE WHO WAS SO CALLED GOOD AND THEY WEREN'T EVEN THE EXPENSIVE
        ONES. So THIS PLACE IS #1 RATED SUSHI AND THEY OFFER SUSHI NO ONE ELSE
        OFFERS ANYMORE EEL , WHITE TUNA AND SO MANY AND THEY ALSO HAVE THE RAW
        MEAT OPTIONS AND COOKED THEIR IS SO MANY KINDS YOU CANT TRY THEM ALL. As
        you can see I bought variety just try and have sushi for two days but
        was so worth it. I AM also a WEGMAN SHOPPER NOT FOR EVERYTHING BUT IM
        EVEN TELLING MY FAMILY YOU WANT SUSHI THATS ACTUALLY FRESH AND NOT SURE
        WHAT TO GET GO HERE. Cause I received all this plus a pot of hot green
        tea. Also a SOFT SHELL CRAB FRIED APP TO GO First time trying soft-shell
        crab amazing and the sauce Fire🔥🔥🔥🌹” Very Affordable and their
        Fairly prices cheapest sushi in town. Hope they stay in business Ill be
        coming back !! Also have ramen bowls exc. Many to offer for other people
        as well. BE KIND THEIR NEW AND IM TELLING YOU SO WORTH IT. My mom was
        even shocked how cheap’ I tipped but they don’t pressure you which is
        nice and on receipt they do not care how much’ So very nice I tip well
        when people are nice. Service was Top Notch they don’t  talk much but
        who cares was awesome place. Can say is very clean also may not be the
        nicest for decorations or smooth looks but still clean and sorry tell
        you people but sometimes those are the best places! I grew up in the
        city so understand the best food comes from the ghetto’ But they are in
        a decent area very nice on the blvd. So not in the ghetto It was just a
        saying Im using cause sometimes people are ignorant. You don't like this
        place something wrong with you cause they are the best!!!
