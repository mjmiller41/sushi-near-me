        My best friend and I stopped by Osphere for Happy Hour and had a pretty
        good experience overall. Parking can sometimes be a concern in downtown
        Orlando, but we lucked out with street parking right in front of the
        restaurant. If that hadn’t worked out, there’s a parking garage just
        around the corner, which is convenient.


        Since the weather was perfect, we opted for outdoor seating, which made
        for a lovely atmosphere. I started with a lemon drop martini, which was
        refreshing. We shared buffalo wings, which were just okay, along with
        loaded nachos. My friend ordered the shrimp tempura. The food overall
        was decent—nothing extraordinary, but good for the price, especially
        during Happy Hour.


        If you’re looking for a casual spot with reasonable Happy Hour deals
        near Lake Eola, Osphere is worth checking out. The service was solid,
        and the setting, especially outdoors, is a nice touch. Would I rush back
        for the food? Probably not. But for drinks and a relaxed vibe, it’s a
        good option.

        Let’s just start with the fact that they have unlimited mimosa for $19!!
        If you’re a lightweight,  the mimosas are $5, so keep that in mind
        before you make a hasty purchase. The food was AHHHMAZING! The reviews
        on the chicken and waffles detoured me from indulging because let’s be
        clear, chicken tenders are not true chicken and waffles! We got a few
        dishes even though I only posted two and all were great! The pancakes
        were delicious, with great flavor! The potatoes were also great! My
        husband had the French toast and it was also good. Loved the DJ! Great
        mix of music for all genres. Service was excellent and the restaurant
        was clean. I will definitely check them out again! Make this your next
        brunch destination:)

        My family and I enjoyed a wonderful brunch this weekend at Osphere. We
        had our dog with us, so we sat outside on the patio. The surroundings
        were beautiful! I ordered the Scrambled Egg Open Face and it was
        absolutely delicious! My husband had the Hangover Burger and my son had
        the Chicken and Waffle. Both enjoyed their meals very much. Everything
        was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. Service was quite slow (maybe
        because we were sitting outside), but our server was extremely friendly.
        If I lived in the area, I'd be a regular there!

        Great Time at The Osphere


        We had an amazing time at The Osphere! Nikky, our server, was
        fantastic—super attentive and made sure everything was just right. We
        tried the Eola Old Fashioned, Swan Paloma, Tuna Tartare, Volcano Roll,
        Scallop Risotto, and Hawaiian Ribeye. Every dish was delicious,
        especially the ribeye and risotto. The Key Lime Pie was the perfect
        sweet ending.


        One little hiccup: the starters came before the drinks, but it didn’t
        bother us. Overall, it was a lovely experience, and we can’t wait to go
        back!
