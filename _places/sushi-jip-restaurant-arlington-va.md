        THE BEST sushi in the DMV. So incredibly fresh and well prepared. I’ve
        had a ton of sushi in my life, (just  got back from Japan) and this
        place is outstanding. The service is amiable. The portions are generous.
        A gem of a spot run by a sushi chef who has worked at high class fine
        dining restaurants. The price is unbeatable for the quality. 11/10
        recommend.

        What an absolute gem! The sushi here is fantastic, the staff are
        friendly, and the owner is wonderful.


        We moved to the Midwest and don't get to eat sushi often, so this was a
        real treat. All of the fish was fresh and tasty. Everything was
        beautifully arranged and assembled. The portion sizes are fantastic,
        particularly the thickness of the bluefin tuna.


        The miso soup is made from scratch and it's the best I've ever had! I
        would go here just for soup if I wasn't in the mood for sushi.


        Our waiter was entertaining and attentive, and the owner checked on us
        frequently. We had such wonderful conversations with both of them. It
        was a true pleasure to meet them.


        I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who loves sushi and a
        wonderful experience.


        We ordered some of just about everything, and all of it was delicious.
        Check out the pictures.

        I ordered takeout from Sushi Jip and was so impressed that I can’t wait
        to visit in person! The sushi was incredibly fresh, beautifully
        presented, and full of flavor—even after a short car ride. They even
        gave us some extra pieces to the sushi deluxe entree, so that is very
        much appreciated.


        The menu offers a great variety, with something for every sushi lover,
        from classic rolls to creative specialty options. If the takeout is this
        good, I can only imagine how amazing the dining experience will be.


        From my understanding, it looks like this is a new owner. Whatever
        they’re doing, they’re doing it well. Will update soon when I go in
        person.


        Update: I’ve been to the location twice now, and it’s even better in
        person. Everything is fresh and made to order, and every specialty roll
        I’ve tried has been excellent. The staff treats us with kindness, and
        the food is crafted with a level of care that Arlington could use more
        of.

        This is one of the best sushi spots in the DMV, hands down. Our table
        accidentally ordered unagi (eel) when we meant to order uni (sea urchin)
        and the owner was generous enough to give us the uni on the house.


        Beyond that kind gesture, their staff are very friendly and also
        hilarious. Great vibes all around the moment we stepped into this
        amazing sushi restaurant. Highly recommend!!

        I’ve visited Sushi Jip a few times since it transitioned from Endo, and
        I’ve noticed a big improvement. My first visit was just okay, but I
        decided to give it another try—and I’m glad I did! The rolls are
        delicious with generous portions, and the sushi, especially the Hokkaido
        uni and toro, is incredibly fresh. The atmosphere is cozy, not too
        crowded, and in a nice area. This has become my go-to sushi spot, and I
        highly recommend it to fellow sushi lovers!
