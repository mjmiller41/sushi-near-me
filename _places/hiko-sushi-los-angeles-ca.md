        Shockingly fresh sushi (everything we ordered!) in this hole in the wall
        - highly recommend! Even did the high end sushi place thing where
        sometimes sushi is seasoned / specific approach to the sushi is
        recommended based on seasonality / preparation. This is going to be our
        neighborhood spot for sure. Don’t sleep on this place!

        The food and service here were both really good. Unfortunately, I
        thought the prices were too high for what I got. A few of the dishes on
        the menu seem overpriced compared to similar restaurants in the area.

        Visited from the midwest and was told to stop here. What a beautiful
        experience. The fish was so delicate and delightfully prepared. The rice
        was out of this world. A quaint and memorable experience in the big
        city!

        To give fair warning to anyone going in the first time: It's required to
        order a minimum of 4 items per person at a table and 5 per person if
        sitting at the bar. Sitting at the bar also means that the chef decides
        what you eat.


        With that caveat out of the way the sushi was absolutely the best I've
        ever had. Many of the dishes had sauces put into them while being made
        and were recommended to be eaten without anything added to them. I
        followed that advice and didn't regret it for a moment.


        The fish melted in the mouth and, even as a person who enjoys spicy
        foods but doesn't handle them well, the spicy sauce put into each item
        was superbly done and never caused me any problems. Each individual part
        was designed to perfectly compliment the main ingredient.


        I do have to specifically mention that the eel was stunningly delectable
        and now heads my "best sushi item ever" list.


        The staff was incredibly nice and unfailingly polite even though I came
        in a bare 30 minutes before they closed. The restaurant was small but
        delightfully proportioned to allow close seating without feeling
        crowded. The place seemed quite clean and well kept, the music selection
        was nice and provided excellent background to the idle talk, and the
        location makes it into a hidden gem nestled between other businesses.


        I highly recommend this place for anyone looking to delight their palate
        and appreciate a small and quiet meal. I personally intend to make a
        more regular habit of visiting.

  What Customers Are Saying About the Spot$$$Folks generally rave about the
  incredibly fresh and well-prepared sushi here, often highlighting how the
  flavors and presentation make for a memorable meal that's worth seeking out.

  elevate the experience, a few mention that the prices can feel a bit steep
  compared to other local options, though many agree it's justified for the
  taste. There have been occasional gripes about challenges like outdated hours
  or difficulty getting in touch, but these don't overshadow the overall
  positive vibes from satisfied diners. All in all, it's a solid choice for
  anyone hunting for top-rated sushi near me, with the authentic Japanese
  specialties winning over repeat visitors. If you're in the mood for reliable
  sushi restaurants close to you, this place offers a welcoming vibe that's
  generally hit the mark for flavor and service.
