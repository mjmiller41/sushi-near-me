        Food is ok but not up to the standard of any authentic Japanese
        restaurant.  I had the Chef’s choice of sashimi, the tempura don and the
        eel don for my husband.  Tempura was very dry and hard.  Sashimi was
        fine.


        Service was terrible.  The server wanted to charge my credit card before
        I got my bill.  When I requested for the bill, she said I have to pay
        first and she would print the bill to me.  After I paid, she came back &
        threw the bill at me on the table.  I’ll never come here again.  NEVER
        AGAIN!

        Had takeout at Kissaki Omakase. They delivered from Hudson Yards all the
        way to the Upper West Side, which was nice. The sushi was solid, and the
        packaging from the takeout was the best we have ever seen. I'd
        definitely order from here again!

        I kind of think this place must be a joke, and there must be hidden
        candid cameras someplace…

        I’d sum this place up as an over-sauced, under-designed, vastly
        over-priced, nearly serviceless sushi/nigiri house.


        Three of us order the 6 and 7 course “dinner”(literally the word they
        use on the menu) for $60 and $70 a piece. Each “course” is just a bite,
        so think more omakase style. Except without almost any service from an
        omakase experience. Almost no service whatsoever. And they don’t serve
        the bites one at a time either. And the bites themselves are prepared
        way over sauced, which is too bad because you can tell the quality of
        fish is actually pretty good (so two stars versus one). See the pic.
        Thats four courses. Lol


        The atmosphere of the place is uninspired and totally bland. We made
        reservations for 7pm on a Friday night and were one of two seated
        tables. That included the bar, which was completely empty. (Worth
        mentioning the restaurants across the hall were packed.)


        Long story short, after spending $200 before tax on “dinner” we went
        downstairs to little Spain and ordered $15 burgers and fries to finally
        get enough to eat.


        I’m not trying to be a hater. I have eaten at incredible sushi houses in
        the city. But this is not one of them. It is certainly not selling 5, 6,
        and 7 coursed “dinners,” and they really should change the wording on
        their menu. Perhaps if they list as something else, it wouldn’t be so
        offensive.


        I’ve never eaten a burger after a $200 dinner before. But glad little
        Spain is just downstairs.


        Avoid, unless you want a pricey snack. I will avoid moving forward,
        because they are just way too many other spots that are better than
        this, across the board! Service was one star. They didn’t keep our water
        glasses filled or offer us any.

        We were pleasantly surprised by how delicious the small sushi spot in
        Hudson yards was. It was extremely fresh and everything tasted really
        good. We weren’t sure what to expect when we walked in as it was a
        smaller spot and wasn’t too busy as it was after the lunch rush but as
        mentioned everything was really good. My only complaint is it seemed
        like there was only one person really working the floor and the sushi
        bar and I think the hostess was doubling trying to help as well. They
        still did really well for being understaffed, but things were definitely
        slower when it came to getting my sake or some of our other orders. I
        don’t fault them for that at all and I think they did a good job as a
        place got busier.
