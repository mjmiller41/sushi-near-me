        Was recommended to try this place with a group of friends who raved
        about this restaurant.

        Compared to the other high end sushi restaurants I’ve tried, the
        experience at Amami was okay. The deluxe is priced decently for a chefs
        choice. The presentation is beautiful with slender cuts of fish, but the
        quality of the fish is not as fresh as I would’ve liked.

        As a Japanese person from Japan, I'd say most Americans may think this
        is good "sushi" if they've not tried any authentic ones. Just order the
        rolls and skip the Nigiris. Nigiris are cut pretty but I would almost
        consider it worthless. The name suggests a Japanese place but the place
        is entirely ran by Chinese owners, chefs and servers.


        Ordered:

        - 2 Sushi Deluxe (9 piece + rock'n roll + miso soup per order)

        - Ankimo (4 pieces)

        - Oyster shots (2 spoons)

        - Mix-it-up roll

        - Tiger roll


        Intro:

        First of all, the male receptionist with spiky hair was flat out rude
        and a liar. We waited an hour outside and he came out and called peoples
        names on the wait-list. I noticed he skipped my name which was the next
        in line so I went in and checked with him, he said rudely that he called
        my name but I wasn't there so he skipped me. I responded by saying that
        I was there, he didn't call my name. He started mumbling something in
        Chinese with frustration and kept saying he called my name but I wasn't
        there. I started laughing because I thought he was joking as I was
        literally standing by the door, and turns out he was seriously lying to
        my face. (Maybe he couldn't pronounce my name? Who knows...) So I told
        him my car parked directly outside the door has a video recording if he
        wanted to see. Then he goes and speaks to one of the servers and gets me
        a table. He had a very entitled attitude and told me it happened because
        I didn't check in. (I walked in, put my name on the tablet wait-list,
        and spoke with the guy to make sure I'm good, and replied to yelp's text
        with confirmation, stood outside patiently and went in periodically to
        check the tablet for status for an hour so I don't know what I did wrong
        to make him angry?). At this point I was already feeling this was a
        terrible experience, in terms of service quality, for the money I'll be
        paying.


        Food:

        - Sushi Deluxe consisted of:

        3 Salmon, 2 Bincho Tuna, 2 Hamachi, 1 Aji and 1 Escolar.

        To me, anything that says "Deluxe", I expect at least one piece of Ebi,
        Ikura, Chutoro, Otoro, or Uni. They provided the lowest and cheapest
        kind of Tuna ( Bincho Maguro), cheap Salmon (lean cut, no fat),
        borderline sickening Escolar (full of laxatives, Japanese don't use this
        for food). Hamachi and Aji were moderately good (when I say good, it's
        Japanese supermarket sashimi grade). The best part was rock'n roll as
        well as the wasabi that wasn't the typical paste-style you'd find.


        We never got ginger, while other tables were served with it.

        Also, we didn't get our Miso soup until we had to ask 30mins into our
        dining experience.


        Marukai market has better salmon, tuna, and hamachi for much cheaper and
        fresher.


        - Ankimo:

        Tasted a bit old and stale but ok for the price. You can buy better ones
        at Korean supermarkets for cheaper and fresher.


        -Oyster Shots:

        I assume middle to low tier grade oyster, barely fresh. Covered by an
        overwhelming amount of flavorful toppings to cover/ fancy it up.  I'd
        say ok appetizer for the price but wouldn't have more than 1 for the
        fear of getting sick from old oyster. Also, one spoon had a tiny piece
        of Hamachi mixed in it accidentally. Could be extra bang for the buck
        but also shows the chefs don't care about contamination.


        - Mix-it-up roll:

        I like it. They have low tier fish so get them fried like Mix-it-up. It
        has 3 kinds of fish mixed up and lightly fried to cover the cheap taste.


        - Tiger roll was shrimp tempura, salmon and avocado, can't go wrong with
        that. Liked this too.


        Overall, you're paying for the premium looking pretty presentation, not
        sushi quality. I spent $140 for the two of us and the dining service and
        experience kinda sucked, tables are packed tight and the restaurant is
        not too clean. I almost regretted taking my date there but I promised
        her a genuine sushi experience next time.

        Quality fish with generous portions. Every sushi place I go to gets
        compared to Amami and no other restaurant compares. Omakase is my
        favorite for variety and the fish to rice ratio is my preference (way
        more fish than rice). My kids love their teriyaki and teriyaki udon.
        They always hook us up with extra goodies as regulars, showing that they
        take good care of their regular customers. Highly recommend! (Even
        though parking can be tight sometimes.)

        A decent sushi option in the South Bay.


        I like getting either the chirashi or sashimi here, since their omakase
        is just okay to me.


        The rice is served warm, which is a great contrast to the raw fish. I
        find it a bit strange the sashimi is cut thick and short... Almost like
        blocks. It doesn't necessarily affect the taste of the fish, but the
        texture and the temperature is definitely impacted. When slices are cut
        longer and a bit thinner, I feel like the fish has a more consistent
        temperature. Here, the center of the fish feels slightly colder than
        it's exterior.


        Check in to the wait-list via Yelp! The parking here is pretty narrow,
        so watch out for pedestrians and cars backing out of tight spaces. You
        may need to circle the lot like a shark on busy weekends.
