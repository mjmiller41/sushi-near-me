        Sushidokku – A Hidden Gem in the West Loop! 🍣✨


        Sushidokku is one of those places where the price tag feels totally
        justified because the food is next-level. A solid 10/10 for sure! 😍


        Let’s talk about the drinks first – the pear up is a game-changer.
        Crisp, refreshing, and just what you need to start the meal off right.
        🍐 As for the food, the takoyaki (octopus) was packed with flavor, and
        the hamachi with ponzu sauce is so fresh, we had to order it twice. The
        Ecuador Roll is massive and definitely worth every bite – you’re going
        to want that on your table. The tataki tuna was good but the japanese
        mustard has a kick I was not expecting. And do yourself a favor and save
        room for the matcha cheesecake… it’s a showstopper. 🍰


        Service? Hands down the best waitress we’ve had in a while. Super
        attentive and genuinely made the experience feel special. 🏅 The
        location is perfect for a date or a small gathering with friends in the
        West Loop. The ambiance is relaxed but chic – soft lighting, great
        music, and a vibe that’s not too loud, so you can actually enjoy your
        meal. 🎶


        One thing to note – the place is small and gets crowded fast, so
        reservation is definitely recommended. In fact, getting a table can be
        insanely difficult (we booked a month ahead), so if you’re planning to
        visit, definitely book beforehand. It’s worth the effort, but you’ll
        want to plan if you're coming for a few days.


        It’s also on the pricier side – expect to spend around $100 per person,
        which includes a bottle of sake. But trust me, it’s worth every penny
        for the quality of food and the overall experience. 💸


        A heads-up: there’s just one girl’s bathroom, so there might be a wait.
        🚻 The food came out super fast, which was a nice surprise, but it did
        get a bit chilly – we had to stay inside instead of enjoying the outdoor
        seating that day.


        Overall, Sushidokku is definitely worth the splurge. Amazing food,
        incredible drinks, and an atmosphere that’ll make you want to stay a
        little longer. 🌟

        Sushidokku – A Hidden Gem in the West Loop! 🍣✨


        Sushidokku is one of those places where the price tag feels totally
        justified because the food is next-level. A solid 10/10 for sure! 😍


        Let’s talk about the drinks first – the pear up is a game-changer.
        Crisp, refreshing, and just what you need to start the meal off right.
        🍐 As for the food, the takoyaki (octopus) was packed with flavor, and
        the hamachi with ponzu sauce is so fresh, we had to order it twice. The
        Ecuador Roll is massive and definitely worth every bite – you’re going
        to want that on your table. The tataki tuna was good but the japanese
        mustard has a kick I was not expecting. And do yourself a favor and save
        room for the matcha cheesecake… it’s a showstopper. 🍰


        Service? Hands down the best waitress we’ve had in a while. Super
        attentive and genuinely made the experience feel special. 🏅 The
        location is perfect for a date or a small gathering with friends in the
        West Loop. The ambiance is relaxed but chic – soft lighting, great
        music, and a vibe that’s not too loud, so you can actually enjoy your
        meal. 🎶


        One thing to note – the place is small and gets crowded fast, so
        reservation is definitely recommended. In fact, getting a table can be
        insanely difficult (we booked a month ahead), so if you’re planning to
        visit, definitely book beforehand. It’s worth the effort, but you’ll
        want to plan if you're coming for a few days.


        It’s also on the pricier side – expect to spend around $100 per person,

        The Ecuador roll and the chef prepared nigiri rolls were excellent - the
        marinated salmon and especially the scallop was perfectly tender and
        excellent flavors.


        The Ecuador roll was good but perhaps that’s the best roll among the
        rest on the menu.


        I also enjoyed the Miso soup a lot, it was deeply flavored.


        I liked the ambiance as well, but not sure the value of this restaurant
        holds up over time, I found this to be very expensive for the amount of
        food you get.

        I came for restaurant week lunch, not impressive at all. food is very
        plain, not much flavor…..look at the pic, for two of us, only 5 items 😰
        and no soup no dessert. I could have spent my $60 somewhere else with
        better choices. Will not come again. The service is so so, I asked the
        tall guy, maybe restaurant manager for a wasabi, but I forgot to ask for
        ginger. When he brought Wasabi, I realized and mentioned ginger, he goes
        “wasabi and ginger” sounds like he wanted to remind me that I could have
        told him both…….😂 street parking very hard to find a spot.  sorry to
        say but seriously don’t have any highlight…..

        First of all, I would like to recommend the restaurant to adjust their
        reservation system. We were told to go to this place by recommendation
        and it was very difficult to book a table on a Saturday afternoon. After
        getting the reservation and arriving at the place, it was not busy at
        all. On the other hand, I have to say that the food is amazing. From the
        starters and the nigiris, to the rolls, we enjoyed everything we
        ordered.
