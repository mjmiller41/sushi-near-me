        When We come to Oxford to visit my father, this is his favorite place to
        go to get sushi. The atmosphere is very nice and the background music is
        not so loud that you can not have a conversation with those at your
        table. The Bento box lunch is a huge portion, and I appreciate that they
        offer soy wrap for sushi, which my father prefers. When we have large
        family gatherings, we enjoy sitting at the hibachi tables and have never
        had disappointing meals and the grandkids always have great fun with the
        chefs.

        I ordered the vegetable soup and the veggie spring rolls. The vegetables
        in the soup were rather large. The soup had a good taste, but I added
        quite a bit of the seasoning they bring you. This helped it tremendously
        by giving it a little spice. The spring rolls were okay. Im going to say
        they are not made fresh, but that’s just my opinion. They could easily
        do a handmade one with fresh veggies, but not many places do this that
        I’m aware of. They tasted like any other frozen spring roll you buy
        anywhere. We went for our office Christmas party. The service was great,
        and everyone seemed pleased with their food. The table was very clean,
        as well as the silver ware and plates and bowls. I am a diabetic so I
        opted out of the traditional meal with the rice. The three stars on the
        food is specifically for what I ordered, not my coworkers. They all
        seemed very pleased with theirs.

        Very nice sushi restaurant. Not the most attentive service but it wasn't
        bad by any means. Sushi and hibachi were both excellent. Sashimi were
        very large pieces. The roll I had was a little bland. But it did come
        with spicy ponzu which made up for it. Excellent presentation on the
        appetizer and the meal. Will definitely be back.

        I recently ate at Toyo and let me just say that their sushi is not good.
        The tuna was bad and the avocado was browning. The noodles were fine,
        kind of soggy, but our waitress was nice. After leaving that night, I
        told myself that I would never eat here again. Three days later, my
        cousin had a craving for those specific noodles. She called to make the
        order and this is how the conversation went.

        My cousin: Hey, can I do a pick up order for Yaki Udon. Can you make
        sure it has no mushrooms, onions, and carrots?

        Worker: Umm…I don’t think it has vegetables in it.

        My cousin: Yes it does, I’ve eaten it before.

        Worker: Do you want me to just put no veggies?

        My cousin: No because I want the cabbage and other veggies. I just don’t
        want onions, mushrooms, and carrots.

        Worker: Well what veggies do you want?

        My cousin: I want everything but mushrooms, carrots and onions.

        Fast forward, I went to pick up the food, expecting they listened to my
        cousin’s wishes, and when we got home we had everything in it that we
        did not want. This dish was not only for her but for her children.

        We called complaining, and they said that they could make it again, but
        we would have to switch it out. By this time, it was already 10:00 p.m,
        and we did not want to have to leave and waste gas after their mistake.
        So, we called and asked for a refund instead, and they continued to say
        we had to drive to their restaurant and return the dish if we wanted a
        refund. All in all, I think Toyo not only has bad food, but terrible
        customer service. It was obvious that they did not care about making
        their customer’s happy, but rather making money. I would highly
        recommend Kabuki instead
