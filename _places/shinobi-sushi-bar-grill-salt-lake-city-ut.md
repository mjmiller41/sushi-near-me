        Stopped in for dinner with family. We tried the Nabeyaki udon noodles
        and several hand rolls including: Shinobi special, Mexi, Spicy hamachi,
        Phoenix, and Rainbow. I thought the mexi was the most unique hand roll
        with hints of cilantro. One thing I normally enjoy about sushi are the
        contrasting flavors and textures. I have to say that in general I found
        this sushi to be disappointing. The fish was fresh but when I ate each
        bite it seemed muted in flavor… weak in those contrasting flavors I
        love. The texture was not varied either but I do realize that is a
        strong function of the hand rolls I ordered. Atmosphere was great and
        service was good and friendly. Prices are on the higher side but not
        ridiculous.

        I wanted to love it so bad cause it’s so close to home. The environment
        is sterile. The staff was soooo friendly. My owner got the Alaskan and
        playboy and the Shinobi which were good. The calamari was bland and the
        jalapeño poppers were almost raw. The snow crab doesn’t taste like
        anything and the crunchy roll doesn’t either. Luckily it wasn’t bad, it
        just definitely wasn’t good.

        We discovered Shinobi through a sponsored add on Instagram. After
        looking at Yelp and Google reviews we had high expectations and were
        excited to try it. We came in a few minutes after opening and were
        seated right away. The decor was fun and the restaurant was spacious.


        We were deciding on hand rolls and asked the waitress what types of 
        hand rolls they have and it didn't seem like she knew the menu. She had
        to ask her co-worker about the menu. We ended up getting the calamari
        for an appetizer. It tasted mostly of breading and could barely taste
        the calamari. The large sashimi platter was $45 and the fish tasted
        off.. it didn't taste fresh at all and was slimy and warm. The tuna had
        a film on it and the salmon left some slimy spots on the plate. We were
        struggling to finish it.


        We picked 2 rolls, the Phoenix roll and the firecracker roll. The
        firecracker was doused in sauce and you can't taste any of the fish. The
        Phoenix roll  was okay.


        The service could use some improvement. Our waitress came over a little
        after we started eating to give us our checks.. we weren't halfway
        through eating our food. When we were ready to pay, she cleared our
        table and passed by several more times but didn't grab the check. It
        took over 15 minutes for her to grab it. When she did ring us up, she
        was standing at the counter talking to her co worker for another 5
        minutes before bringing us our check to sign.


        Overall, the ambiance of the restaurant

        was good, but the food wasn't. Our total ended up being $100 and it
        wasn't worth it. This was probably the most disappointing dining
        experience we've had.

        We wanted sushi as a family while we were downtown SLC. All of our
        favorites had 1-2 hour waits so we were on our way home when we saw
        Shinobi. Glad we stopped by. Delicious sushi, all very fresh and fish
        forward. Prompt service, nicely decorated interior, and friendly staff.
        We got the Samari, Shinobi Special, Winter, Spicy Hamachi,

        Red Line, Playboy, and California rolls. All were pretty well executed
        with nice flavors, textures, and finishing sauces.

        This is the cutest little place! I’m always hesitant to go somewhere new
        in Salt Lake because of the parking situation. Went here on a Friday
        night & there was plenty of free parking, which I appreciated. The front
        door is located in the back, which was very confusing. I ended up
        walking around the whole building before figuring this out. I ordered a
        cosmopolitan drink. It was delicious & beautiful in design as well. We
        ordered the seaweed salad & edamame to share. Seaweed salad was pretty
        good, the sesseme oil was strong in this dish, but not overbearing. The
        edamame was really dry when we received it. It was also the last thing
        brought to our table, after our main course food. Which also seemed a
        little odd. My friend is gluten free so she ordered the avocado roll,
        Tekka roll, & Sake Maki roll. All three rolls seemed very simple & she
        really enjoyed them. I ordered the simple veggie roll, which was exactly
        as it sounds, very simple. Not my favorite, but it was okay. I also
        ordered the Shinobi veggie roll & I was in love with this roll!! It has
        tempura pumpkin wrapped in soy paper topped with fresh avocado. Highly
        recommend this vegetarian roll! My friend was not able to try it because
        of the tempura. I love that they have a few veggie rolls separate on
        their menu from all the other rolls. It made it easy to figure out which
        rolls I could eat. Staff was great & very attentive. I would definitely
        go back & do recommend for your next sushi outing!
