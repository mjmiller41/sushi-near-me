        Came here for dinner with friends and family.  Everyone ordered their
        own dishes. Over all review is decent I would say 3.5 for the current
        price point and the quality.  The sashimi is fresh, and the udons and
        steak teriyaki are great!  But let me warn you first, the seafood
        teriyaki stated it has salmon, shrimps and scallops.  Salmon was decent
        portion and 4 shrimps and half slice of the scallops, which was 1 thin
        piece of scallop. That was the reason for 3.5 stars. Or else it would
        have been a decent 4, for the quality, services and food portion.

        Came here for dinner with friends and family.  Everyone ordered their
        own dishes. Over all review is decent I would say 3.5 for the current
        price point and the quality.  The sashimi is fresh, and the udons and
        steak teriyaki are great!  But let me warn you first, the seafood
        teriyaki stated it has salmon, shrimps and scallops.  Salmon was decent
        portion and 4 shrimps and half slice of the scallops, which was 1 thin
        piece of scallop. That was the reason for 3.5 stars. Or else it would
        have been a decent 4, for the quality, services and food portion.

        I stopped here for lunch and enjoyed the shrimp tempura, pork katzu, and
        sushi. The service was pretty good and the prices were reasonable. The
        inside is a nice atmosphere as well. I would definitely return.

        The best sushi i’ve ever had! I got the “Tropical” roll with kani salad
        and sat at the bar where the sushi chef gave me a sashimi/seaweed salad
        on the house! The waitress was also very kind and attentive! Definitely
        worth a try, I’m from Florida but my boyfriend said this is a MUST TRY
        spot while i’m here and i'm glad i did! Definitely will again!

        Terrible Experience — Disrespectful Service


        I’m writing this review to warn both current and future customers about
        the unacceptable treatment my friends and I (a group of five)
        experienced at Okinii. What was supposed to be an enjoyable dining
        experience quickly turned sour due to the rude and disrespectful
        behavior of the staff.

        When it came time to pay the bill, we were still deciding whose card to
        use when the waitress stood over us as if monitoring our payment. One of
        my friends politely asked for a couple of minutes, and she walked away.
        However, when she returned, she snatched the bill right out of my hand.
        I calmly told her, "I'd appreciate it if you don’t snatch things out of
        the hands of paying customers." Shockingly, she laughed as if it was
        funny and then returned with a new bill showing a higher total ($177
        increased to $188) without a clear explanation.

        When we asked why the amount had changed, they gave us vague responses,
        claiming it was an error but refusing to provide specifics. By this
        point, we were fed up with the blatant disrespect.

        Sadly, I couldn't help but notice how other patrons were treated with
        far more courtesy. No bills were snatched from their hands, and their
        questions were answered politely. It was hard not to feel that our
        treatment was racially motivated.

        If you're Black, I urge you to avoid Okinii. They do not treat Black
        customers with respect. We need to stop giving money to establishments
        that blatantly disrespect us. This experience was not just
        disappointing—it was dehumanizing.

        Probably the best sushi in town. Loved King of the Sea. It's something
        about the rice that made sushi almost melt on first bite.

        Great vibe and nice environment to hang out with friends after work.
        They also have a good selection of drinks.

        Miso soup was great too, perfect for a winter evening.
