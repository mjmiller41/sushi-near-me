        Awesome spot here! Been a couple times, and the staff has always been
        amazing! Sushi is tasty, and the portions are great! The prices seem a
        bit high at first glance, but in relation to the portions, it is a
        bargain! The teriyaki plates are bento box style, and the box sections
        are large!! Itâs great. The special rolls are very tasty. The food
        presentation is lovely. The atmosphere/decor is very modern, minimalist,
        and cool. The parking lot is small, but is free and always seems to work
        out.


        Highly recommend! We got sushi nigiri, chicken teriyaki, salmon
        teriyaki, garlic pepper shrimp,  sashimi, and the forbidden roll. The
        teriyaki plates come with CA roll/spicy tuna, mixed tempura salad,
        orange, rice, miso soup, and another sushi dish.


        We have gone off hours (2-4ish); never a wait, and pretty quiet.

        This exquisite Japanese sushi restaurant is nestled between Montrose and
        LaCanada on Foothill drive. The staff is just awesome and so welcoming.
        One of the freshest selection of sashimi and sushi I've seen... Probably
        more so for this area. They also have many Japanese inspired dishes and
        many rolls to explore.


        If their food doesn't blow you away I'm sure the fried tempura ice cream
        will. Oooh... Don't forget the ice cold beer served on frozen mugs.  One
        of the most refreshing beer experience, period!


        Parking is plenty and kids have lots of choices other than sushi.
        Definitely a family friendly restaurant.

        By luck of google i believe Iâve found my new favorite sushi place hands
        down. We came in here midday for a late lunch and were greeted with
        friendly chefs and welcoming wait staff. Every order of sushi was
        perfectly balanced and fresh and even their rolls were tasty and not
        overflowing with rice. We will definitely be coming back to try more
        items on their menu and see what else they will surprise us with. Highly
        recommend !

        I LOVE Sakana. I first tried it right after re-opening from the lockdown
        and they were doing bogo rolls and I absolutely loved their spicy tuna
        rolls.


        Today, honestly, it was my first time dining in  and I cannot believe I
        went this long without trying anything else.


        Here's a list of everything my friends and I ate today:


        Sashimi 40. $140. Giant sashimi platter. Super fresh and delicious fish.
        Varies per order.

        Red Blossom Roll 10/10

        Radish Roll 8/10

        These two are non-rice rolls.


        Spicy Tuna Roll 10/10

        Crispy Tuna 10/10

        Baked Salmon Roll 10/10

        Shrimp Tempura Roll 9/10

        On the House Roll 10/10. Made special for us by the chefs because we
        ordered a lot of food and drinks hehe


        Special rolls are around $20, and regular rolls are about $10 each.


        Service and food 10/10!!!

        Update: My lovely bride and I went here for anniversary last night. It
        was calm we're able to be seated right away. The servings were abundant.
        For the price we got a great deal of food. We had a wonderful time, the
        service was excellent. Once again highly recommended.


        Very busy on Valentine's Day. The reservation system on the app must
        have gotten overloaded because everyone who had a reservation was told
        to put their name on the list and would be served in order. Even with
        that we were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation. The staff was
        very helpful and covered for each other in a difficult situation. We
        look forward to going back there and trying not on a holiday. The prices
        are a little bit High but the servings are huge. We all came home with
        at least one meal more to enjoy at home. I would recommend this
        restaurant
