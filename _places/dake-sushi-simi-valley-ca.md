        Got the AYCE option and it was great! For this option they serve half
        portions which is genius! It allows you to try different rolls and my
        daughter and I probably tried a dozen different rolls.  They have
        riceless rolls as well which is unique and very good.  We loved all our
        choices.  They allow sashimi and sushi in the AYCE as well.  Service was
        great and the environment is very casual.  I would highly recommend this
        place!!

        This place is awful. The food is only subpar, if it's brought to you at
        all. The service is by far the worst service I've ever received. Our
        drink remained empty for 85% of our meal even after repeatedly asking
        for refills. We asked for more water 6 times and they took one of the 7
        glasses and never came back with the water. They have a help wanted sign
        in the window so hopefully they hire some servers who know how to serve.
        I try to give as much grace as I can but this was my second time here
        with the same type of service and we were 1 of only 4 tables in the
        restaurant. The only reason I can back is because they are one of the
        few places that offer All You Can Eat and my dad eats a lot... I can
        definitely say, I will never come back. I'd rather pay out the rear for
        him to eat than come deal with the crap service again.

        They have a few items with BOGO promo on Uber Eats, we ordered the CA
        and spicy tuna roll, I thought they were good. Wished they gave more
        pickled ginger though!

        Nice little place! There's a lot of sushi places in Simi Valley, but
        there's something to be said about the authenticity of this place.
        Tokoyaki was top-notch, and the baked crawfish roll was amazing as well!
        I would definitely give this place a chance if you haven't already!

        This place is AMAZING! Not too many quality all you can eat restaurants
        around the area, but I’m so glad I found this one. I’m a tough critic
        when it comes to sushi restaurants but at $40 for AYCE sushi dinner for
        this quality is unheard of nowadays. The food was delicious with
        generous amount of fish and the service was super quick and great. I
        highly recommend this place.
