        if i could give 6 stars i would! i have been getting sushi from here
        since 2020 and it has been my favorite place ever since. any time me and
        my girlfriend get sushi we always come here! it always tastes super
        fresh, even when we get it delivered. the owners are super nice and the
        prices are always affordable. the maki platter is amazing especially
        since you can customize it and substitute rolls (perfect since we don’t
        like crab 🦀 sushi). Everytime I meet another sushi-lover I have to
        mention avana, and make sure they try this sushi if they haven’t
        already! If you love sushi you have to come here, i promise it will be
        your new favorite place ❤️

        The absolute BEST place for steamed dumplings!  We pick up a couple of
        packs maybe 2 times per week.  They are perfectly steamed, tender pork,
        ground well with seasoning and the wrapping is not super thick. You will
        never be disappointed. And the dumpling sauce is not too salty and has a
        bit of sweetness to it. We love them!! Also, not too pricey and the
        owners are sooo friendly. Love this place ❤️

        Ordered 3 basic sushi rolls on Uber Eats and the latest delivery time
        was 7:50. Lost my first delivery driver because they were still
        “preparing” the order 30 minutes AFTER the latest delivery time. Didn’t
        have the decency to call to let me know they were running behind but had
        the time to disable delivery and pickup orders. Will never try to get
        this place again. If you actually cared about your customers you would
        have the decency to communicate with them.

        Found the food to be ordinary at best.  Scallop nigiri was covered in
        sauces (which is unnecessary and a sign of not-freshness). The rolls
        were skimpy on fish.  It wasn't bad but certainly not worthy of a return
        visit.

        Before last year this place seemed to have a different staff and the
        quality was much better. Rolls have gotten smaller, certain ingredients
        like tofu skin are often missing from rolls, and orders always take
        FOREVER. The past few times I've ordered, it took probably an hour when
        I was told 15-20min for pickup. Always people packed in the restaurant
        waiting for their orders. Unfortunately found another place and don't
        come here anymore.
