        I visited Uzu Revolving Sushi solo right as it opened at noon on a
        Saturday and was seated immediately. Service was friendly and attentive
        throughout. I sat by the first row, which got a bit chilly with the door
        frequently opening, but the space was clean, modern, and welcoming. The
        revolving sushi concept is always fun and super efficient.


        Ordering is done through a QR code, and in addition to sushi on the
        belt, they offer hot items like karaage chicken and miso soup, delivered
        by a robot train. The freshly grated wasabi and quality pickled ginger
        were great touches.


        Standouts included the scallop with truffle oil, yellowtail with
        jalapeño, Godzilla Roll, and 24K Majic Roll—flavorful, fresh, and
        well-executed. The Green Dragon Roll was also good, though the eel
        portion was a little small. The biggest letdown was the bluefin toro
        sashimi, which was served very frozen and didn’t live up to the premium
        price. Plates go from $3.99 to $9.99 so a good variety and range.


        That said, overall fish quality was solid. At other revolving spots like
        Kura, quality can drop off over time, but since Uzu is part of the Ivea
        Restaurant Group—the same group behind Gyu Shige (a personal favorite)
        and South East Impressions—I’m hopeful they’ll maintain consistency over
        time.


        Do note that parking can be tricky, especially with so many popular
        restaurants and the Teso Life Japanese market next door.


        All in all, a fun, fast dining experience with some great bites—just
        needs better handling of high-end items to really impress.

        I visited Uzu Revolving Sushi solo right as it opened at noon on a
        Saturday and was seated immediately. Service was friendly and attentive
        throughout. I sat by the first row, which got a bit chilly with the door
        frequently opening, but the space was clean, modern, and welcoming. The
        revolving sushi concept is always fun and super efficient.


        Ordering is done through a QR code, and in addition to sushi on the
        belt, they offer hot items like karaage chicken and miso soup, delivered
        by a robot train. The freshly grated wasabi and quality pickled ginger
        were great touches.


        Standouts included the scallop with truffle oil, yellowtail with
        jalapeño, Godzilla Roll, and 24K Majic Roll—flavorful, fresh, and
        well-executed. The Green Dragon Roll was also good, though the eel
        portion was a little small. The biggest letdown was the bluefin toro
        sashimi, which was served very frozen and didn’t live up to the premium
        price. Plates go from $3.99 to $9.99 so a good variety and range.


        That said, overall fish quality was solid. At other revolving spots like
        Kura, quality can drop off over time, but since Uzu is part of the Ivea
        Restaurant Group—the same group behind Gyu Shige (a personal favorite)
        and South East Impressions—I’m hopeful they’ll maintain consistency over
        time.


        Do note that parking can be tricky, especially with so many popular
        restaurants and the Teso Life Japanese market next door.


        All in all, a fun, fast dining experience with some great bites—just
        needs better handling of high-end items to really impress.

        My husband and I are both sushi lovers and it was our first time dining
        in a sushi restaurant with a conveyor belt. The atmosphere was warm and
        bright and we were greeted by friendly staff. The food was so good and
        we enjoyed the many options they have. Our favorite was the blue fin
        tuna w/ sea urchin, it was so delicious it just melts in our mouths. The
        coolest part is that they have 2 types of delivery robot, one above the
        belt and one on the floor for special orders. We got our food fast
        because of those robot things and we just think it was so awesome. Our
        servers Ewan and Khoa were also attentive and they keep checking on us,
        giving us information about the food and how the conveyor works. I will
        definitely recommend this sushi place and can't wait to share it with
        our family and friends.

        Absolutely phenomenal experience at UZU Revolving Sushi! The sushi was
        fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The revolving setup made it
        so fun and convenient to try a wide variety of rolls and small plates.
        But what truly made the night unforgettable was the amazing service from
        Isa and Sebastian. They were incredibly attentive, warm, and
        knowledgeable—always checking in with a smile and making sure we had
        everything we needed. Their energy and professionalism took an already
        great dinner to the next level. Can’t wait to come back again—five stars
        all the way!

        The Shops at Congressional Village has some great Asian restaurants,
        from Kanpai, Kajiken and now Uzu.  Loved the interior and service was
        pretty good.  You can grab the sushi from the conveyor or you can order
        from the QR code.  Your food will be delivered by their bullet train. 
        They had club music on which enhanced the vibe.  If you sit in the
        counters by the front door, you will get first dibs on the sushi.


        Favorites were fatty tuna, seared salmon and this scallops.  I forgot
        the exact names but you can see my pictures.

        Great experience all around. Ewan was very tentative as our server,
        always made sure our waters were filled.


        Revolver had many options, all labeled with a sign. If the revolver
        didn’t have what you’re looking for, the tablet and QR code made it easy
        to order. Orders came quick and sushi was decent for the price. Only one
        I did not like, which may be personal preference, was the squid. The eel
        was delicious.
