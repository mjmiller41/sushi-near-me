        Found Masa on Yelp while I was on this side of town. I was craving sushi
        and this was the closest location. When I walked in I was the only
        patron during the lunch hour, which was a little concerning at first.
        However, as I sat down and scanned the menu, I realized how many pickup
        orders they were pumping out! So many!

        I was greeted and brought water and soy sauce. They have QR on the table
        so I was able to order on my phone. The app came out first pretty
        quickly and followed by the roll soon after, but enough time to finish
        one before the other showed up.

        I started with the Yellowtail Jalapeno and it was delicious. Fish was
        fresh, the cucumber and jalapenos were fresh and the jalapeno had a nice
        heat to them. Definitely enough to split for an app! I also got the
        Tiger Roll and it was so good!  I don't think I have had one like this
        before! Loved the crunch and the fish on top. Sauce was good, too. I
        like mine spicier but it was fine for a one pepper designation. My bill
        came quickly and I was in and out in under 30 minutes.

        The restaurant was clean, lots of tables, and spacious.

        I would definitely come back! Esp if you can be in and out for lunch in
        under 30 - no need to get take out then.

        Came here the last time I was visiting family in GR. Don't remember the
        name of the ramen that I got, but I remember it being really good. My
        siblings and I also shared some sushi as an appetizer. All in all, a
        pleasant experience. Unfortunately, I can't recommend any specific
        dishes as I forgot to review this place right after coming here a couple
        months ago.

        The service was amazing but sadly the

        Food is another story. Calamari was too greasy and there was barely any
        squid inside the fried breading. Miso soup was really cloudy and our
        Ramen noodles were just not tasty. My daughter did not like the over
        cooked shrimp in her ramen. They were chewy and hard to bite. This was
        the same with my champion Ramen as well. We appreciate their kind
        service but food was not impressive. My husband did not enjoying his
        pink lady sushi because it was too mushy. Will not be returning.

        Have been here a handful of times now and every single time I've been
        very satisfied. Just ordered the “Black Dragon Roll” and I'm pretty sure
        it’s some of the best sushi I've had in a long time! The owners are
        super friendly and know what they're doing.

        Delicious sushi, salad was amazing. My son devoured 2 soups (they
        accidentally gave us a soup instead of salad and immediately replaced it
        without even asking) lunch prices are hard to beat we shared 2 lunch
        orders and we're in need of a nap. Highly recommend!
