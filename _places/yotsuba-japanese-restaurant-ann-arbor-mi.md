        Even though I live in Toronto, Ontario, Yotsuba Japanese Restaurant &
        Bar is a must-visit every time I travel to Michigan to see my nephew. It
        has become a tradition for our whole family to dine here, and it never
        disappoints! The sushi is always fresh and beautifully presented, the
        flavors are authentic, and the service is exceptional. The staff is
        welcoming and attentive, making us feel right at home. The cozy ambiance
        adds to the overall experience, making it perfect for family gatherings.
        Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for top-quality Japanese
        cuisine in the area. Can’t wait to come back on our next visit!

        Bar is a must-visit every time I travel to Michigan to see my nephew. It
        has become a tradition for our whole family to dine here, and it never
        disappoints! The sushi is always fresh and beautifully presented, the
        flavors are authentic, and the service is exceptional. The staff is
        welcoming and attentive, making us feel right at home. The cozy ambiance
        adds to the overall experience, making it perfect for family gatherings.
        Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for top-quality Japanese
        cuisine in the area. Can’t wait to come back on our next visit!

        I had an amazing experience! The sushi was incredibly fresh, and the
        flavors were spot-on. They offer a great mix of classic rolls and unique
        specialties—I highly recommend trying the firecracker roll, as well as
        the vegetable tempura!

        The service was fantastic; the staff were friendly and attentive, making
        sure we had everything we needed without being overbearing. The
        atmosphere was warm and inviting, perfect for a date night or a casual
        lunch/dinner. This is definitely one of the best sushi spots I’ve been
        to, and I can’t wait to come back!

        Went to Yotsuba Japanese Restaurant with my girlfriend after a Michigan
        football game and it was excellent!  We had several dishes and each was
        fresh and delicious.  I've been to this restaurant many times over the
        years and it always is consistently good.  Many thanks to the great
        people working at Yotsuba and we'll be back soon!

        We came for lunch here with friends from Texas. We had CC as our
        waitress. She was so nice and very efficient. She kept coming back to
        check on us and got my brother’s order in right away since he was on
        call for his job and needed to leave soon.

        The food was absolutely delicious! Everyone (5 people) ordered something
        different and each rated their food 5 stars! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

        We will be returning again for the tasty dishes and will definitely ask
        for CC- an amazing waitress!

        I had one of the worst dining experiences at this restaurant. The
        service was beyond disappointing.


        First, our appetizers arrived after we had already finished our main
        dishes—what’s the point of ordering appetizers if they come at the end
        of the meal? It completely ruined the flow of our lunch.


        Second, our orders were brought out at completely different times. Two
        people in our group finished their meals before the rest of us even got
        our food. By the time the rest of us were served, they were just sitting
        there waiting for us to catch up. It was awkward, frustrating, and
        unacceptable for a restaurant that should know how to time their service
        properly.


        Overall, the lack of coordination and attention to service made this an
        awful experience. I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for
        a decent dining experience. Definitely not worth the time or money.
