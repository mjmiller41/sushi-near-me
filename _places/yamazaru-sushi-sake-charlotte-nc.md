        This place is a must-visit for sushi lovers! Everything was fantastic.
        The miso soup was divine, and we tried the Kiss a Fire Roll, Black
        Diamond, and The Snazzy — all three were absolutely amazing. Highly
        recommend and would definitely order them again.


        The atmosphere was inviting and the space was clean and well-maintained.
        We stopped in on a Tuesday night for dinner without a reservation and
        were seated promptly. Despite it being a busy night, the staff was
        friendly, accommodating, and got our order in quickly. The food came out
        in exceptional timing, which was impressive.


        This was my first time here, and I will definitely be returning on my
        next trip to Charlotte. If you’re looking for great sushi with excellent
        service, this is the place to go!

        My favorite goto place. They are usually always busy but have always got
        us in rather quickly. The customer service is phenomenal ! Very
        attentive. We get the same thing everytime… Westwood roll, California
        roll and gladiator roll and a side of steam dumplings. Never fails.

        It was my first visit with my friends. We had the lychee martini to
        start with, the cocktail was very spot on! Host was very attentive
        regardless how busy it was. Our server Eric was funny, he provided the
        most enjoyable experience! The owner Hata stopped by to talk to us, very
        personal and hospitality! I ordered the hamachi Jalapeño and Chirashi
        special. I’m a sushi lover, the sashimi was very fresh! I loved it!
        Definitely worth the visit!

        Kiss of Fire: 4/5 - Kiss of fire was good. Packed with flavors of tuna,
        salmon, spicy mayo, crunch, etc. Some pieces had perfect amount of tuna
        filling while others had very little filling.


        Crazy Horse: 2/5 - It was messy to eat the Crazy Horse sushi as the
        fillings weren’t rolled tightly. The avocado and cucumber pieces were
        falling out. Taste was bland.


        We ordered from UberEats. No soy sauce was provided.
