        So I’m coming back from Downey (don’t ask), handling some property
        stuff, and I call up a friend. He just happens to be nearby, and like
        true sushi soldiers, we decide to meet at Sushi Gen — because of course,
        that’s what everyone does when they’re within a 10-mile radius of Little
        Tokyo and feel like standing around hungry for 45 minutes questioning
        their life decisions.


        The wait? Classic. 30–45 minutes, which gives you just enough time to
        spiral into existential dread while the host gives zero indication you
        even exist. But finally — we get seated. It was my friend’s first time.
        He’s a hardcore sushi guy, like the kind who judges you if you say
        “sushi roll” with too much excitement. We both ordered the hamachi kama
        (yellowtail collar), sashimi set, and sprinkled in some extra bits of
        raw sea treasure.


        Here’s the thing: Sushi Gen is good. The kind of good that makes you nod
        in polite satisfaction while thinking, “Yeah, okay, I get it.” But in
        today’s world of sushi arms races and omakase wars, being consistently
        good is starting to feel like showing up to a Formula 1 race in a Toyota
        Camry. Reliable, yes. Exciting? Meh.


        Fish quality? Still solid. Experience? Nostalgic and humble. But if
        you’ve had a tour through LA’s newer spots, it’s hard not to notice
        Sushi Gen’s staying kind of… still. I give it a respectful 3.8 stars. My
        friend? Brutal. A hard 2 and said he’s never going back. Might’ve been
        the wasabi betrayal. Who knows.


        But since you made it this far, let me reward you.

        If you want a spot that blows Sushi Gen out of the miso soup — go to
        Fisherman’s Table in Huntington Beach. That place is criminally
        underrated. Like, “why is this not packed every night” levels of good.
        You’re welcome. Now forget I told you.

        Truly perfect. Felt like I was back in Japan again. Sushi was a true
        10/10, no question. The quality, the selection, the freshness, etc were
        all perfect. The service was just as good. I was served and attended to
        like I was the only person in the restaurant despite there not being a
        single empty seat. If you’re looking for your go-to sushi spot that’s
        authentic and not some tuned up LA nonsense, this is it.

        first time coming here and it was amazing

        my boyfriend and i tried this place and we got there during happy hour
        so we did the omakase option that comes with a variety of nigiri, a miso
        soup and a hand roll. ALL AMAZINGGG

        we did also shishito peppers, and crispy tuna rice. they were perfectly
        made. then we had green tea mochi and the lady was kind enough to add
        the lychee icecream because she really wanted us to try it. everything
        was so delicious and they were all so sweet.

        i was so happy i found this place and would definitely come again ❤️

        It had been some time since I ate lunch at Sushi Gen primarily because
        of the challenge of getting downtown from the westside, and also due to
        the massive amount of people who go there for their incredible sashimi
        lunch special. But with the Dodgers championship parade today and the
        need to wait out the throngs of people before I could leave the area, I
        waited a very short time before getting the first available space, which
        was a seat at the sushi bar (no lunch special at the bar).


        Sushi Gen is a timeless classic. It is so reliable for a great variety
        of fresh, authentic sushi at what I consider throwback prices. You won't
        find any crazy rolls or sauces here, all the better to allow the chefs
        to focus on the essence of the fish which is best experienced unadorned
        in my opinion.


        I had eight orders, including varieties rarely found at other Japanese
        restaurants in LA (including engawa, kohada, sardine and shima aji).
        Feeling very satisfied and impressed by the consistency of the
        experience so many years apart, I was pleasantly surprised (there are no
        prices on the sushi menu at the bar) to see a pretax and tip bill of $66
        which averages out to just over $8 per order - a steal for this quality,
        freshness and variety.


        The only drawback is that it is very crowded, which is not surprising
        given that the sushi is as good as it gets in LA. In order to
        accommodate as many people as possible, they really squeeze people in at
        the sushi bar and the tables in the relatively small dining room are
        also tightly packed. Service is almost too efficient as they are eager
        to accommodate the many people waiting outside.


        For me, the most accurate rating for Sushi Gen would be 4.5 if 1/2 stars
        were possible as these crowded conditions are less than ideal for what
        should be a more serene experience. But that won't deter me from finding
        a reason to be downtown so I can go back soon.

        It's in the Little Tokyo District. I went there at the recommendation of
        a local friend, but there is a minimum charge at the dinner bar. Four
        orders are essential, but it is difficult for tourists to use them. It's
        inconvenient that there's no price on the order form and there's no
        explanation or picture on the menu.
