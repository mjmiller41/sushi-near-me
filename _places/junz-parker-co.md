        Junz is tucked away in a mini mall off Dransfeldt Rd. The exterior is
        unassuming, and their interior is modern yet simple. Their sushi,
        however, is the best in Parker.  They have a sizable sushi bar and
        plenty of seating. We were ushered to our table immediately upon arrival
        at 1230pm on a Sunday. We ordered the sashimi roll, crunchy roll, spider
        roll, and rock n' roll. We chose the shrimp cocktail appetizer as well.
        Each selection was beautifully prepared, and the ingredients were fresh.
        The pricing was reasonable for the quality, producing value. Their
        standard rolls had the look and taste of a deluxe roll anywhere else in
        Douglas County.  We finished every piece and left stuffed as their
        portion sizes are ample.  We will be back and highly recommend giving it
        a go if you're in the area.

        Waited a bit before a server came to our table.  It was a Friday night
        and surprisingly not busy at all.  Sushi was really good as always! 
        Miso soup, very salty, never used to be like that.  The beef teriyaki
        was not as flavorful, lacking teriyaki, and had a lot more fat on it. 
        We didn't receive our apps until the main meal was served, and the green
        tea ice cream did not taste like green tea ice cream at all.  Not sure
        what it was, but somewhat disappointing.  I gave the food 4 stars
        because the sushi was really good, but if I had to rate it based on the
        other items we ordered, probably a 3.

        This is my favorite sushi place! They have real pickled wasabi, which is
        incredibly hard to find in Colorado! The staff are great and make me
        feel welcome.  Josh is a fantastic sushi chef and the sushi rolls are
        some of the best around!  They also have reasonable prices.
