        Seriously, if you’re looking for a sushi/ hibachi place to try, this is
        IT!! I can’t recommend this place enough. 10/10 on everything.

        The service was impeccable. The food was mouth watering. They even gave
        us complimentary sides while we waited for our sushi and entrees. And
        the food came out FAST!

        The holiday atmosphere and decor was so calming and pleasant. My husband
        and I have tried our fair share of sushi and hibachi places around
        orange park and Jacksonville. This is, hands down, the absolute best
        place to eat!

        My wife’s son, Alonso, and I came here today and their reputation didn’t
        disappoint us. It’s Alonso’s favorite place. I’m not much into sushi but
        the menu offered many options for people like me. I chose the chicken
        katsu and he got pork katsu. My wife will eat the chicken teriyaki we
        got her. The appetizer that we enjoyed was called the Holiday rolls, but
        it wasn’t anything like a roll to me. It was very tasty. They started us
        off with a bowl of clear soup and garden salad. I chose the ranch
        dressing but Alonso had the ginger dressing. I used my fork while Alonso
        used complimentary chop sticks. The food was delicious and very
        flavorful. Now I know what I will be ordering in future visits.

        This was our second time there. Power went out this time and it was
        daughter’s birthday. We ate in the dark no big deal but it meant no
        birthday celebration. Their birthday celebration is the best. It
        happens. We went to pay and they comped our meal because of it. Was so
        nice of them. Food was amazing and great service. We drive 45 min to go
        there from Yulee. Thanks for a great dinner. Will be back soon

        From the outside you wouldn't expect such a great restruant. In a world
        of dying food service our experience here was great. Food was great,
        staff was great, atmosphere was great. I got the salmon and shrimp, most
        places skimp on the protein but I definitely got a good portion.
        Definitely will be our go to from now on.

        Best sushi in Jacksonville!! We enjoyed the time here. They have the
        conch sashimi which is very fresh and delicious.

        I really appreciate their very welcoming culture by providing
        Philadelphia roll while we have to wait for our food. Staff is friendly.

        Everything is so fresh and creative. Been here at least 10 times but
        they have never failed me once.
