        The service was welcoming, polite and very pleasant. She answered all my
        questions with a smile and checked back on me a couple of time

        I wish the food was as good, however. The ramen was warm, bordering on
        room temperature. Rather than being soft boiled as you'd expect, the egg
        was one minute away from being hard boiled. The broth probably started
        out fine, but it was too salty. I suspect this is a result of the over
        cooked (read dry and tough) pork cutlets included in the dish. They were
        so salty as to be nearly inedible. When the server asked how I was
        enjoying my meal, I remarked on how salty it was. She smiled and nodded
        apparently pleased with my assessment. I probably wouldn't revist this
        restaurant in the future.

        So the reviews that are posted are very mixed in a wide spectrum. We
        decided to give this place a try since the overall rating was good. When
        we walked in, it was almost empty except a few customers. Our server was
        very enthusiastic and wonderful! Following his recommendations, we got a
        ramen and sushi. Like other reviewers stated, they give a LOT of fish
        for their sushi. Unfortunately it didn’t feel the freshest to me and my
        stomach was upset later. I also didn’t like the fake wasabi
        (horseradish). The ramen broth was good but salty. I was definitely not
        impressed with the ramen and a side of pork katsu which wasn’t the
        authentic style pork I was expecting for a Japanese ramen. Overall, it
        wasn’t as bad as some reviews stated but I also would agree the food
        just did not deliver the taste and authenticity I was expecting.

        Good sushi,  great Ramen bowls, and they make great drinks too! I will
        certainly go back the next time I'm in Portland.

        I had placed a pick up order on door dash at 8:54 pm. I was told through
        my app that it would be ready for pick up at 9:22 pm. I arrive a few
        minutes early per usual when picking up take out, when I was told it
        would be a little bit. It is now 10:04 pm and am still waiting for 2
        shrimp tempura rolls and 1 pork ramen. I understand waiting a bit but it
        should certainly not take 42 plus minutes for an order of that size.

        We were looking for a new place to get Ramen, and we stumbled across
        this place and what a great stumble!! If I could give. 10 star I would
        that’s coming from both of us. Best fried rice, the sushi rolls at the
        size they should be at a very reasonable price! And delicious. Our
        server was outstanding. We had a bunch of questions and she gladly
        answered them all. Definitely recommend this place hands down!!!!!!!!
