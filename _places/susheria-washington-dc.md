        Gabriella was our server and she was unbelievably amazing and ensured we
        had the best service possible. She recommended AMAZING drinks for me and
        my bf and we both loved them! I just explained what I liked and she knew
        EXACTLY what I should get. It was definitely difficult for me to
        understand the menu, being a first timer there. Gabriella went through
        and explained everything so that we could better choose what we wanted
        and manâ¦ it was a hit! They also had a live dj so the vibes were great.
        Definitely going back and asking for Gabriella again!!!:))) 10/10 highly
        recommend. (The Sebastian is what I ordered and yes yes and yes)

        I recently visited Susheria and it was an amazing dining experience. The
        atmosphere, service, and food all came together to make it a truly
        enjoyable night.


        The vibe at Susheria is relaxed and trendy, with a modern, stylish
        design that immediately makes you feel at ease. The music selection is
        on point.  I will say that Susheria is perfect for casual dinner with
        friends or a laid-back date night, the place is not only stunning but
        the service was excellent! Very welcoming and vey attentive, and I will
        leave the best at the end, the foodâ¦ was delicious, every time I eat
        sushi I expect fresh and great quality seafood and I was impressed. I
        will definitely recommend Susheria for an amazing experience.


        Would completely comeback to this amazing place.

        I had a great time at Sushiera DC, especially during their R&B nightâthe
        vibe was on point! The appetizers and main dishes were delicious, and
        the overall experience was enjoyable. However, I was disappointed with
        the misleading promotion about their half-off wine deal. The sign
        clearly states âÂ½ off ALL bottlesâ but in reality, the discount only
        applies to expensive bottles. This was not only frustrating but also not
        mentioned on their website, which also advertises âÂ½ off all bottles.â I
        didnât appreciate the false advertising, and I think they should be more
        transparent about their promotions.


        Would love to return for the food and atmosphere, but honesty in pricing
        is just as important!

        Susheria Restaurant Review â A Must-Visit Spot in Georgetown, D.C.


        Susheria is a true gem in Georgetown, offering a perfect blend of
        Japanese and Peruvian flavors in a sleek, modern setting. The
        restaurantâs industrial-glam dÃ©cor creates a stylish yet inviting
        atmosphere, making it an ideal spot for both dining and socializing.


        The menu is a masterpiece, featuring omakase, izakaya, specialty rolls,
        and expertly crafted meals that showcase the fusion of Japanese
        precision with vibrant Latin flavors. Their sushi is fresh and
        beautifully presented, while their Latin-inspired cocktails add a unique
        twist to the dining experience.


        One of the standout aspects of Susheria is its lively vibe, especially
        on Wednesdays when the DJ sets the mood for an unforgettable night.
        Whether youâre coming for a delicious meal or a fun night out, the
        energy here is unmatched.


        The staff is exceptionalâfriendly, attentive, and always ensuring guests
        have a top-notch experience. From start to finish, everything about
        Susheria exceeded expectations. I will definitely be returning to enjoy
        more amazing food, drinks, and great vibes!
