        I never write reviews and I had to write something about Akaoni.


        This isn’t your over the top sushi place.  This is simple sushi done
        incredibly well, and for me, that is the best kind of sushi.  The
        quality of the fish was wonderful and the prices were fair.


        The atmosphere is humble, but authentic. Like a place you could see
        being lifted up from Tokyo and dropped in Carmel, and in a town full of
        opulence, it’s refreshing.


        Please understand before you go here this is a 2-3 person operation and
        be prepared to wait a bit while the lone chef takes care of the orders
        ahead of you, the wait will be rewarded.


        I felt the service was very respectful, but deliberate, which, if you’re
        the only server sometimes you need to be.  Say your pleases and thank
        yous and your warmth will be returned.


        Try the Toro, it’s bananas.

        Best sushi experience I’ve had. Fresh fish, melts in your mouth, delish!
        Cozy, quiet, and just overall excellent! Thank you!


        Update 2/1/25: Visited again. The fish was as fresh and delicious as
        last time. The sushi chef and host were very friendly.

        Phenomenal sushi spot in Carmel. Simple food done incredibly well, you
        can tell everything is fresh and carefully prepared. We had the jyo
        sashimi plate witching was great value for the quality of fish. The best
        tuna I’ve had in a very long time by far. And the toro was to die for I
        can’t recommend it enough.

        The restaurant itself is simple and not flashy but to me it was perfect.
        A breath of fresh air for the area in my opinion.

        I felt that the service was great, to the point and efficient but kind
        and attentive. As long as you are polite you will receive gracious
        service back.

        Overall I would go back again and again if ai lived closer to try all of
        the fresh picks of the day and new dishes the chef comes up with. Don’t
        listen to the 1 star reviews and plead try Akaoni

        Excellent! Called for reservations about 30 minutes before close on a
        Friday and got them on my first try. The wife/server hung up on me,
        haha. But in person I did not find them to be rude at all, just a
        language barrier I think. They were overly pleasant/gracious. My water
        glass was never more than half empty. Service overall was very good.


        We had sashimi, chef's choice sushi, a few odds and ends off the special
        board, and clam miso soup. All of it was excellent. The yellow tail is
        the best I've ever had, I would return just for that.

        A Culinary Journey to Remember at Akaoni


        From the moment I stepped into Akaoni in the enchanting town of
        Carmel-by-the-Sea, I knew I was about to embark on an unforgettable
        dining adventure. This isn’t just a restaurant; it’s a portal to a world
        where every bite tells a story, and every dish is a masterpiece.


        The ambiance struck a perfect balance between elegance and comfort, with
        subtle lighting that made the exquisite Japanese artistry around the
        room come alive. The staff welcomed us with genuine warmth, making us
        feel like honored guests in a grand culinary celebration.


        Then came the sushi - oh, the sushi! Each piece was a work of art,
        crafted with precision and passion. The fish, fresh from the dreams of
        Neptune himself, melted on the tongue, leaving behind a symphony of
        flavors that danced across the palate in perfect harmony. The sushi
        chef, a true maestro, wielded his knife with the grace of a samurai,
        presenting us with creations that were too beautiful to eat, yet too
        delicious to resist.


        But the magic didn’t stop at sushi. Every dish we ordered was a
        revelation, from the succulent sashimi that whispered secrets of the
        deep to the innovative rolls that brought together flavors and textures
        in ways I never imagined possible. It was clear that Akaoni isn’t just
        serving food; they’re crafting experiences.


        The highlight of the evening was an exclusive dish, whispered about
        among culinary circles but rarely seen. It was a fusion of flavors so
        unique, so extraordinary, that words fail to capture its essence. Let's
        just say it was an epicurean dream that lingered long after the last
        bite.


        As we bid farewell to Akaoni, walking out into the starlit night of
        Carmel-by-the-Sea, it was with the knowledge that we had just
        experienced something truly special. This wasn’t just a meal; it was a
        voyage to the heights of culinary excellence. Akaoni is not a restaurant
        you simply visit; it’s a destination you experience with all your
        senses.


        If you find yourself in Carmel-by-the-Sea, do yourself a favor: visit
        Akaoni. But be warned, your culinary standards might never be the same
        again.
