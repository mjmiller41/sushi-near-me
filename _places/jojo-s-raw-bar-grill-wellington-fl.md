        Been coming here for 3 years never a bad time. I play in the Tuesday
        poker league and used to come to the Wednesday bingo with some friends,
        good drinks and food in my opinion for a dive bar.


        Over the years I’ve met some cool people here and have made some great
        bar stories.


        See you on Tuesday.

        Over the years I’ve met some cool people here and have made some great
        bar stories.


        See you on Tuesday.

        I definitely will be returning! I had their Black & Blue burger and it
        was amazing. Even though they were packed and hosting an event the
        customer service was great, everyone was attentive and friendly. I 10/10
        recommend checking them out.

        I went in totally ready for anything. Based on reviews it could be
        exceptionally great or I could have issues with being acknowledged by
        the wait staff. Did I mention, “I was ready for anything”?


        Being a pilot I travel often and have a range of experiences on almost
        every trip.  Today at JoJo’s it was mostly good.  I was immediately
        acknowledged and provided menus when I sat at the bar.  She returned
        with my water and offered meal suggestions;  one of which I chose, Ahi
        Tuna with steamed mixed vegetables and fried sweet plantains.


        Let me say that the presentation was exceptional.  The plate popped with
        color and flavor!  I was especially impressed with the mountainous pile
        of steamed mixed vegetables.  Why?  The flavor and not to mention how
        the pile remained hot all the way to the bottom as I took my time to eat
        every morsel.  The Tuna was rolled in sesame seeds, seasoned, and seared
        to perfection.  The plantains were the best I’ve ever had even though I
        couldn’t fit the last 2-3 pieces in my gut!


        So, why only 3 stars for atmosphere.  There was an older woman whom I
        assume was the manager or owner present at the bar a couple of times. 
        She corrected the bartender while she was answering questions from one
        of customers at the bar.  The bartender was tending to 8-10 patrons
        sitting around the bar, including myself.  It’s not that the woman
        corrected the bartender that brought me down but more so how she did it,
        with a tone and demeanor that was in my opinion completely uncalled for.
        As she left the bar, she shouted to the bartender, “just give me a water
        and I’ll get my own two beers”, mumbling as she hurriedly walked away. 
        I want to see smiles and a happy place.  I know that from my 50 years in
        the business, others want pleasantry as well.


        Please be happy or get out of the hospitality industry.  You shadow an
        otherwise excellent experience for others!


        Kudos for the bartender for NOT missing a beat!


        Give em a try.  I’m willing to bet you’ll love the flavors at JoJo’s Raw
        Bar & Grill!

        I've never had a bad meal here. Everytime I go is great. They also have
        an extensive craft beer menu. Best seafood in Wellington. Every waiter
        is excellent as well. And i've never had bad service.

        I called in wings & cheese fries for pick up. After waiting 40 minutes
        for my food I waited an additional 20 minutes to get acknowledged in the
        restaurant. When I was finally able to get an employees  attention to
        take my payment I was given the nastiest attitude as if I was doing
        something wrong. When I addressed the manager about his rude employee
        his response was “don’t talk about my employees like that” 🥴

        Taking a step back & looking at all the employees they all seemed to be
        sloppy drunk.

        My food was horrible. Blue cheese dressing tasted like robitussin. I’ve
        never had such questionable wings in my life. They looked disgusting and
        tasted worst. My first and last time EVER giving my money to this
        unprofessional establishment.
