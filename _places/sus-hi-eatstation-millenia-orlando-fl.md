        This place is cute! We ordered through the self-service kiosk and the
        food took a while to be ready, to be fair they were very busy. The food
        was great!! Only issue was that the food area where they make things was
        very messy and dirty, didn’t seem like they keep it clean throughout the
        day and that worried me because of the raw fish that stays there…. Other
        than that everything else was fine. OMG the tempura burrito thing was
        AMAZING.

        I was extremely excited to try this place, I ordered a miso soup and a
        Fry me a river burrito.


        Unfortunately, I did not receive the miso soup.

        The burrito was extremely underwhelming, extremely. I know most foods
        don’t look like the promotional photos, but in this case I was supposed
        to receive salmon and tuna based on the description. I received I kid
        you not, 2 pieces of tuna across both half's of the burrito, also didn’t
        include avocado and a couple other ingredients as well.


        I consumed one half hoping that there was more protein within it but
        nope just one piece of tuna, extremely disappointed with everything
        overall :(

        The food is absolutely delicious, no doubt about it. However, the
        service was terrible. There was a woman at the register with long hair
        and an unfriendly expression who treated us with a lot of attitude. We
        chose to pay our $47 bill in cash, and without even checking, she
        immediately said she didn’t have change. My wife politely asked her to
        check the register, and guess what? She did have change — she just
        didn’t want to do her job.


        The place was also dirty, with glass surfaces clearly neglected and
        unclean. It’s obvious that this restaurant is in desperate need of a
        good manager. Such a shame, because the food really is wonderful.

        All food has been delicious!


        Don’t miss trying the loaded rice tots!  Amazing!


        My burrito was soooo good!  All food made fresh to order so skip if you
        are in a hurry, or order ahead!


        The ingredient options are extensive!  You will not be disappointed!

        The rice wasn't cooked all the way.. it was hard and almost inedible.  I
        asked for the sauces to be on the side and they didnt give any let alone
        on top of the dish.  Unfortunately i took it to go so returning it wasnt
        feasible.  I powered through it and mow my gums are sore.  Service was
        ok, more of a self service type environment where you pay at a kiosk so
        it can take a long time depending on who's at the kiosk.. feels like
        waiting at an ATM.   Atmosphere is ok however not a good setup for a
        line of 6 ppl where your standing next to other people's tables.  Place
        is meh.
