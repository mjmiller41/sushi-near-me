        Picked up an order to go to try for the first time, will most definitely
        be returning. Everything was fresh and tasted delicious. The tempura was
        a little soggy but that’s on my end for having to drive home with it
        first. Still, it didn’t taste like old oil and was great. Shrimp was a
        little small but tasted fresh and not overcooked. Sometimes the tempura
        veggies aren’t cooked well at other restaurants but these were cooked
        perfectly- no raw centers. Crazy boy was a cooked sushi and was very
        good. The spicy tuna crispy rice had no detectable spice, in fact I
        forgot it was supposed to be spicy until I checked the receipt after.
        Besides that, it was extremely good. Rice was crispy and chewy and the
        tuna on top was very fresh.  Very sweet sauce that went well with it.


        Really excited this place has opened up nearby and will recommend it to
        others

        Ordered the crispy Goyza, chicken karaage,  shrimp crunch roll, bulgogi
        rice bowl, and miso ramen (spicy). The Goyza was very crispy and good.
        The karaage was good too. It wasn't as crispy as I liked, but I would
        order it again. The shrimp roll kinda small. It is very tasty. I really
        liked the bulgogi. The only problem I had with it was too much rice and
        not enough meat or vegetables.  Personally, I don't think I would order
        it again. The ramen was very good. The noodles were cooked well. The
        broth was very tasty. The egg was a bit plain. What I didn't like was
        that it cost extra to make it spicy. I didn't get enough heat to warrant
        the extra cost. I also think it needed a bit more vegetables like maybe
        some green onions. Saying that, I would go back for the ramen again. The
        restaurant was very clean, but it was a bit cold inside. Granted, it was
        in the low 30s, but let's turn on the heaters, please. Our waitress was
        very friendly and attentive. Please keep in mind that taste is
        subjective. I do recommend this place, and I will definitely be back.

        Very clean and tidy space with great service. But the food just fell
        flat. The spider roll was super basic but flavorful. But the spicy miso
        ramen was really bad. Like the worst ramen I've ever had a restaurant.


        The chasu pork was embarrassingly bad and overcooked. It tasted like it
        was burnt on the grill, plus it was razor thin. The broth tasted like
        statight peanut butter. It was an absolute horrible representation of
        ramen.

        super friendly.


        The agadashi tofu was the best I ever had, great presentation. They are
        soon to get their liquor license as well.


        Perfect for a family outing.
