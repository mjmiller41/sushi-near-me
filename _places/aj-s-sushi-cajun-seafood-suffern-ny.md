        The sushi was delicious and came out quickly. Although the servers
        didn’t smile or seem very friendly, the food was so good that I’ve
        already visited twice. The salmon sashimi, in particular, was incredibly
        fresh and absolutely top-notch.

        Who doesn't like a good 'all-you-can-eat'?  Sometimes, despite better
        judgment, one just has to let their inner 'fat-kid' out and go nuts.

        But let's be perfectly clear on something - it is very rare should one
        come across an a.y.c.e. where the food is exceptional.  Most a.y.c.e.'s
        are about pumping out lots of cheaply prepared, carb-rich, salty food
        that separates a fool from his dollar after just two plates.  Now, if
        you're a seasoned buffet professional, you know all the secrets to
        swindling the swindlers.  Start with the proteins, specifically the
        high-end stuff - skip all the things that are going to trip you up;
        rice, noodles, pastas, and breads.  I like to start with the snow crab
        legs, lobster tails, boiled shrimp (not fried), and obviously, Prime
        Rib.

        But you won't find any of those items on the menu here.  This
        establishment gives you two options.  Just two.


        Sushi or Cajun.


        Now, I know that sounds bizarre, and it is.  You can't even combine from
        one menu to the next.  You have to make the decision whether or not you
        want Sushi or Cajun.


        Now this is a conundrum for me, because Sushi and Cajun cuisines are my
        favorite - so you can imagine my disappointment when I asked to do both
        and the waitress said I had to pick just one menu.


        Major Point Reduction.


        I went with Sushi.  And the wife and I went all out.  Okay, truthfully,
        we went overboard.


        The result, well... I had mixed reviews.  You see, they did some things
        right, but mostly wrong.  And they prepared a few things well, but
        mainly, it was kind of mediocre.


        We started with a Miso soup.  It was tasty, but it was practically all
        broth and little to no tofu, scallions, and nori.  Next, grilled squid,
        or ikayaki, in a teriyaki glaze.  It was okay.  But the shumai and the
        gyoza, now those were good (even though I think they came from a bag).


        Then our sushi arrived, and I realized that perhaps we had been a little
        overzealous, as the pictures would suggest.  But I wasn't about to pay
        the additional fee for food wasted charge, so I soldiered on and
        finished my meal with zest and fervor... and immediately regretted the
        overexuberance of my folly.


        It was my first and only meal of the day. I couldn't eat another bite
        afterward.


        Now, as for the sushi.  The quality of the ingredients was very good,
        but the preparation was lacking.  The fish to rice ratio favored the
        rice, and the rice was underseasoned.


        For $28.99 per person, we pigged out - and that's okay.  I was in a
        sushi coma by the meals end.  But was it worth pig-out?  My answer: sort
        of.  Some of the rolls were very tasty, and others were bland.  The fact
        that specialty rolls and common rolls are both included in the same
        price means that a diner should stick to the specialty rolls - you get a
        lot more value for what you are given.  But if nigiri is your thing,
        then this place is a bit of a letdown.  I was disappointed that the
        nigiri pieces I ordered were as bland as they were.


        If you're the kind of person who mixes Wasabi into your soy sauce and
        drowns your maki pieces in the mixture after slathering each piece with
        a slice of pickled ginger, or a person who values quanity over quality,
        then this place is perfect for you.  If you are, however, a purist, then
        stick to your high-end omakase.


        Would I go back?  Yes, I believe I would; but to try the Cajun side of
        the menu and compare my findings, or to scratch a sushi gorgefest if
        ever the craving to be a disgusting piglet arises again.

        I’ve been a regular customer at AJ’s. I’ve eaten here at least 15x for
        the past 5 years. They have the best quality of fish for sushi for an
        AYCE. Every time I wanna try an AYCE sushi closer to me, I always just
        end up driving to AJ’s as I am sure the quality is great!

        The server didn’t seem like she wanted to be there. We Got a bento box
        for my man. The miso was soapy tasting and the meat was dry. I got a $60
        seafood boil. They were accommodating to switch the clams and mussels
        for shrimp however the shrimp and crab were inedible. The crab was
        either heavily salted or old. The shrimp were so overcooked I couldn’t
        get any of the skins off. They were also unclean, it was so frustrating.
        I ordered a Kani hand roll and took everything to go so I didn’t feel
        embarrassed. Disappointing to say the least. Weird v-day vibez.

        I came here with my mom a while ago, when it was under different
        management. I was disappointed in the food when we went earlier today
        because it seems like a total downgrade.


        I got a spicy tuna roll and they used canned tuna. The salad didn’t even
        come with a ginger dressing, it tasted like watered down mayo. The
        salmon also didn’t look real.


        Also, they have a “limiting food waste” policy & will charge you 30% of
        your total bill for any food left over. When I asked if we could pay to
        take home, we were told it wasn’t possible. Even if you paid. Seems
        counter productive.


        Overall, we spent $100 for 2 people & mediocre sushi. The soups were
        good, and I wonder if the KBBQ is a better?


        Our waiter was the best thing there; he was really kind, friendly, and
        helpful. I didn’t catch his name, but he deserves 10/10
