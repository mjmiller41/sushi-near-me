        This sushi spot truly impressed me. The variety of sushi is incredible,
        with options for every taste. The prices are very reasonable, making it
        a great option to enjoy delicious sushi without breaking the bank. The
        atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, perfect for a quiet dinner or a fun
        night out with friends. What stood out the most was the service. The
        owner made sure everything was perfect, checking in with us throughout
        the meal. She was so kind and attentive, making the whole experience
        even more enjoyable.

        I will definitely be coming back.

        My boyfriend and I came for dinner and had an fantastic experience. The
        food was delicious and the staff were extremely warm and welcoming. They
        make all of their sauces and soup broths from scratch, the fish was very
        fresh, and the presentation was beautiful. I would highly recommend this
        restaurant!

        We were struggling to find a late night restaurant that’s kid friendly
        and Google pulled up Ruby City. We hit the gas and ran straight there in
        hopes we’d make it in time for dinner. Not only did we have such an
        incredible meal, but we were entertained and fell in LOVE with Yuki! The
        food won us over instantly, and we’ll be back just to hang out and laugh
        with her again! Usually when you’re the last table in the door so close
        to closing time, you feel like a burden. But the entire staff made us
        feel so welcome and assured us we could take our time and enjoy
        ourselves. The food came out so fast and we basically inhaled it, it was
        that good! If I could have made more room in my stomach to keep eating I
        absolutely would have tried. We plan on coming back early next time to
        enjoy the all you can eat options. Thank you so much for such amazing
        food and even better company!
