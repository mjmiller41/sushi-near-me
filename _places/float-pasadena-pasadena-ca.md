        This is a late review but I was really hoping to like this place since
        it's in a neat little area. This shop is kinda cold though, also when we
        went they kept the food orders on a shelf above the drinks and I guess
        that's how a staple got in my child's drink. They apologized and said
        they'd move stuff around but still I couldn't believe my kid almost
        swallowed a staple. I understand it was an accident but never coming
        here again personally. :/

        This is honestly my new go to place. I've lived in pasadena for 4 yrs
        and I can't believe I haven't been here before. It's a hidden gem with
        great food and amazing people. The workers here are amazing and so
        welcoming!!! I honestly drop by every week just to say hi and grab my
        usual breakfast bagel and my matcha chai latte with cold foam or their
        amazon london fog tea latte with cold foam. It's seriously so good I
        have to stop myself from coming here everyday. I do hope they sell loose
        tea leaf soon since it's really calming.

        Excellent sandwich, highly recommended.


        This is a 2nd edit:

        We are back to Pasadena on June 11, 2024 again to attend the
        commencement on June 14.  It is a very exciting experience to come back
        to Float again that my son likes most when he was here during summer of
        2019.

        The food is the same high quality and excellent taste.

        I hopped out of line from the other coffee shop since the line did not
        move 10 minutes. I wish I would have stayed. I guess there is really a
        reason the other place is so popular compared to this one. Coffee (mocha
        latte) was just OK until I found a faux eyelash in my cup. Then it was
        yuck. Service was not that great either. She definitely did not want to
        be there.

        Not all who wonder are lost. Some are just looking for coffee.


        Float Pasadena is a small specialty coffee and tea shop in the eclectic
        setting of the Burlington Arcade. It’s located on South Lake avenue in
        Pasadena. It offers lattes, lunch, sandwiches, salads, bagels, catering
        and gift cards. Similarly, they have cold bottled drinks like Root
        beers.


        Its interior layout is quite small with limited seats and a relax static
        stability.

        Menu list has all of your basic coffee, teas  and lattes. I had a Mocha
        Latte (H); it was perfect. Staff was competent and professional. Service
        was satisfactory.

        Prices are competitive. Collectively, I enjoyed my latte and order
        experience. I recommend this coffee shop.
