        Coming from an African American male who cooks Asian cuisine very well,
        I was super disappointed. The Thai chicken red curry was so watery. My
        woman ordered shrimp pad thai and that was the worse. The waiter told us
        it was the fish sauce that taste like its bad.. no how about bad
        shrimp.. The only thing we enjoyed was the sushi and even the wasabi was
        old smh.. I guess being black they thought we didn’t know better. Would
        NEVER eat here again.

        Coming from an African American male who cooks Asian cuisine very well,
        I was super disappointed. The Thai chicken red curry was so watery. My
        woman ordered shrimp pad thai and that was the worse. The waiter told us
        it was the fish sauce that taste like its bad.. no how about bad
        shrimp.. The only thing we enjoyed was the sushi and even the wasabi was
        old smh.. I guess being black they thought we didn’t know better. Would
        NEVER eat here again.

        We had already stopped at three other places to try and find food late
        in the evening and all of them had closed their kitchens before finding
        this great diamond in the rough.


        They were kind enough to make us take out even though they closed in 5
        minutes and took our somewhat large order very seriously and all the
        food was hot and fresh made.


        All of the food was very tasty and we still had plenty left over when we
        were full. The egg rolls were my favorite and the pork egg rolls were
        especially good.


        We look forward to coming back to this place during normal hours in the
        future!

        It's a nice quaint spot in Keswick with above average food and I like
        the atmosphere' it is as nice as you'd expect a casual restaurant to be.
        The people were friendly and the food presentation and speed of prep
        were great. Highly recommend. Try the Black.Dragon Roll.

        5 stars all around. Great food, decent prices, and a lot of variety
        (including meat alternatives). I got the vegetarian general tso's which
        was amazing and a sweet potato tempura roll. The person I went with (who
        is a big meat eater) got a salmon sushi and shrimp mei fun. He even kept
        taking the vegetarian chicken off my plate! So I think that means it's
        pretty good. Great portion sizes for the prices too! Will definitely be
        going back!

        Came in for lunch on a Monday, we were the only table. We both ordered
        from the lunch menu and got a Long Island roll.  The coke was flat, used
        to come in a can. I ordered shrimp with vegetables lunch special with
        egg roll and pork fried rice. I got chicken with vegetables- they gave
        me the wrong protein. Egg roll looked old and was burned, fried
        rice/pork was old. Sushi roll was marginal.... nothing I would order
        again but admittedly I have extremely high standards when it comes to
        sushi. Same with my partner's meal, it was not good. Will likely never
        go back for lunch and may stop ordering altogether.  The takeout I've
        had from Queen is usually pretty good so I'm not sure why the food
        served to us in the restaurant was such poor quality. Also, hospitable?
        Not here. Do they ever smile?  We had extremely limited interaction with
        the staff -- they were only there to seat us, take order and then drop
        off the sushi. They didn't once ask us if the food was any good.


        Left most of my food on my plate. I was in a rush and didn't feel like
        explaining all of this but for context I barely ate any rice, two bites
        of sushi, one bite of my burned egg roll and ate only a part of the
        portion of the veggies/chicken.  Extremely underwhelming and
        disappointing!
