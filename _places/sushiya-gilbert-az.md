        My family was in the mood for a yoshinoya style beef bowl so we looked
        around and found a place near the house that was supposedly good. My
        wife had ordered it and she liked it very much. Also, the sushi on the
        happy hour specials were very good, very well made and very affordable.
        I would recommend this place nine times out of 10 if you're in the mood
        for sushi or in Japanese style food.

        There are a few different places we have in our regular rotation when we
        are craving sushi,  and Sushiya is definitely at the top! Their fish is
        always so fresh and delicious.  We love their quail eggs too! On this
        particular visit we also tried their "Sea Bacon" for the first time
        which is scallops wrapped in smoked salmon then torched.  It was unlike
        anything we have ever eaten before! Super unique and yummy dish!

        I’ve been coming to Sushiya for over a decade, and it’s consistently
        been an outstanding experience. The food is always fresh, delicious, and
        a great value, making it one of my favorite spots. What really sets
        Sushiya apart is the attention to detail—the manager is always visible,
        ensuring everything runs smoothly and that customers are well taken care
        of. It’s a terrific small business that truly cares about quality and
        service. Highly recommend to anyone looking for top-notch sushi with a
        personal touch at an awesome value.

        I have to say this is in my top 3 sushi restaurant choices in Arizona.
        I've reviewed and been to many sushi spots, and I am consistent in what
        I am looking for.  First, how busy is the restaurant when I come in?
        When I went in, I was the first that day right at opening. The service
        was quick, and I felt like there were a good range of options. The
        second thing I consider is how pricy each item is.  I found that the
        prices were very reasonable.  If I can get a sushi roll around $5 or
        less, that's a great find. Luckily, you can get away with spending $10
        per person. Lastly, I judge the food it's self. A spicy salmon handroll
        is always my go-to. It's a great roll to pick when you want to consider
        texture,  flavor, and portion size. Everywhere I go, everyone does it a
        little differently. In this case, the texture was minced and creamy. The
        flavor was interesting, as I could taste the Sriracha in the first
        bite,  but I couldn't tell if they mixed their salmon with anything
        spicy or not. This is a good indicator to tell if their spicy rolls will
        have a kick or not. The size was great, I felt like I got a good portion
        of fish. I did order a calamari appetizer as well as their stuffed
        mushroom.  Everything came out hot and fresh, and the flavors were
        great. The stuffed mushrooms.... were stunning. Overall, this cozy
        restaurant was wonderful, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a
        chill, comforting environment. The sushi is great, the service and
        prices match just perfectly.

        Excellent sushi. We went there with a party of 10, during dinner rush,
        several food allergies and the owner made sure we got the right order. I
        greatly appreciate the effort he and our waiter put forth to make it an
        excellent experience.
