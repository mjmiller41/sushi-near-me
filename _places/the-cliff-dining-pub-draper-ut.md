        The Cliff Dining Pub in Draper, Utah, offers a modern American menu with
        delicious brunch. It has scenic views, live music, and a bar serving
        handcrafted cocktails. The ambiance and quality of the food are
        exceptional.


        However, experiences are more often good than not. However, on a recent
        visit, no hosts were present at the front for 10 minutes, so we ended up
        seating ourselves. Granted, this is an anomaly of my many visits. And I
        hope it’s doesn’t become more frequent.


        If you’re planning to visit, consider making reservations and checking
        recent reviews to ensure the best experience.

        I dined here yesterday but I have visited a couple of times previously.
        I really enjoyed myself as I did in the past. The service was great. The
        lighting and atmosphere on the bar side sets a chill vibe. The menu
        options are wide and I had a great meal last night. The coconut shrimp
        are super tasty. The old fashion that was recommended by the server was
        on point. I will definitely be back and I highly recommend.

        I recently had the pleasure of dining at The Cliff Dining in Draper and
        wanted to share my experience. The restaurant offers two distinct
        seating areas: one side opens up to the bar, which can be lively and a
        bit loud, while the other side is much quieter and cozier. If you’re
        looking for a more peaceful ambiance, you can let the host know your
        preference upon arrival.


        A standout part of the evening was the exceptional service. If you
        visit, I highly recommend asking for Sophie as your server. She truly
        goes above and beyond to ensure you have everything you need. Her
        attentiveness and warm personality made the experience even better.


        Now, let’s talk about the food. The spinach dip appetizer is absolutely
        phenomenal—a must-try! The rest of the food was very good overall,
        though I was a bit disappointed with the jambalaya. It didn’t quite hit
        the mark as a true Southern-style dish, which was a little misleading.


        Despite that, the overall experience was pleasant. The great service,
        inviting atmosphere, and delicious offerings (especially that spinach
        dip!) make this a spot worth visiting.

        I enjoyed our visit very much. The server was very professional and
        attentive. The food was excellent. We had the chicken nachos for an
        appetizer and barely had room for the main course. My husband had
        stroganoff and I had the chicken sandwich which was huge.  Everything
        was tasty.  Something I noticed and really appreciated was the tables
        were not all packed together as is often the case in a restaurant.  Also
        the lighting was gentle and relaxing.  This created a relaxing
        atmosphere even with many people in the restaurant.  Also the view from
        the windows was beautiful. We will definitely be coming back.

  What Visitors Are Saying$$$People really enjoy the tasty sushi and other
  standout dishes like fresh salmon and shrimp appetizers, often praising their
  bold flavors and quality ingredients for a satisfying meal. The service tends
  to be friendly and attentive, helping to create a welcoming atmosphere that
  keeps diners coming back for more. While the scenic views and lively energy,
  including live music, add to the fun, some note that prices can feel a bit
  high or that waits might happen during busy times—though these are minor
  compared to the positives. Overall, it's a solid spot for anyone hunting for
  great sushi nearby, with many sharing that the experience leaves them feeling
  glad they stopped in. If you're on the lookout for top-rated sushi places,
  this location offers a enjoyable vibe that balances good food with a casual
  setting.
