        10/10! My boyfriend and I unknowingly got there right after they opened.
        We were the first people there but soon after several other guests came
        in. It’s really good to see people ready to eat their food so early! Sad
        they weren’t serving alcohol at the time because of their license but
        the food was excellent. We ordered the chicken katsu box and salmon
        donburi. Our server was really nice and welcoming! The prices were on
        point too!

        I was surprised to see that it was completely empty on a rainy Saturday
        night in Tracy… so I decided to give Kengo Sushi a try after seeing it
        packed the last time I saw it. Upon walking in, I immediately sensed
        that it was going to be a good experience forsure.


        If you’re looking to get decent Japanese food in Tracy… this is one of
        them. Here’s how my experience went thus far:


        Food: 4/5

        Me and my partner got the 4pc shrimp tempura… which happened to be $8.
        Not bad considering it was inflation, honestly, and the batter of the
        tempura was very crispy. I found, however, that it contained a little
        too less shrimp. The very aromatic tea really made up for the thick
        batter though… that’s for sure.

        We also got the Simba Roll and King Kong Roll… both of which were our
        favorites. They were so good to the point I had to take them home to
        leave them as leftovers LOL.

        Ramen wise, we got the Korean Spicy Ramen and the Shoyu Ramen. I was a
        bit disappointed considering I wanted actual ramen noodles from scratch,
        but instant noodles were just as good — hehe. They included a lot of
        veggies and toppings alongside pork for my shoyu, which definitely
        helped with my culinary palette. The spicy ramen’s level was just right.


        Service: 5/5

        The waitresses were very friendly upon arrival, and kept on checking on
        us throughout our meal…. and they gave us quite good recommendations.


        Atmosphere: 4/5

        I was quite fascinated to find that the entrance to the bathroom was
        identical to going to a cabana or a party. I like the overall design of
        the restaurant, but it seemed a little bit too dark, and I felt a little
        squeezed. In addition, I also felt like there could’ve been more
        variety, in terms of drinks, and in terms of rolls. Not trying to be
        critical, but if there was room for improvement, I would’ve spaced the
        tables around a little bit bit more.


        Overall, I had a really good experience, and I can’t wait to come here
        again with my friends.

        I think this is the best sushi place in the area. The music they played
        was great, and the food was delicious. They had a great playlist going.
        The staff was friendly, and the place was clean. I had a good time and
        left the place with a full stomach. If you haven’t visited yet, it’s
        worth the stop. I will be a returning customer.

        Very bad experience at Kengo.


        I just left the restaurant after visiting on February 14, 2025.
        Surprisingly, the place was not full, even though it was Valentine’s
        Day. My husband, my two children, and I were seated, and they gave us
        the menu. However, no one came to take our order.


        Understanding that it was a busy day with in-person customers and Uber
        orders, we patiently waited without saying anything. But then we started
        noticing that the staff was paying attention to other customers who
        arrived after us.


        We finally asked a waiter to take our order, but he seemed annoyed when
        he did. After that, we saw that at least five tables with people who
        arrived later were having their orders taken and receiving their food,
        while we kept being ignored despite asking multiple times.


        This whole experience lasted around 50 minutes, and it was extremely
        frustrating and disappointing. We were made to feel very unwelcome. I
        will never return to this restaurant. It was a terrible experience.

        I had a decent experience at Kengo Sushi. The food was delicious,
        service was good, only thing that was concerning is that the place
        didn't seem too clean. Table we sat at still had somw crumbs, napkins
        had a food stain on them, menu's were greasy, overall it just seems like
        they could do a better job when cleaning up their tables after they have
        been used.

  What Customers Are Buzzing About$$$Folks generally rave about the tasty sushi
  and friendly service at this spot, highlighting the fresh rolls and flavorful
  ramen as standout choices for a satisfying meal. While most visitors
  appreciate the welcoming atmosphere and reasonable prices, a few have noted
  occasional slowdowns during busier times that might affect the flow of
  service. Overall, the food quality and variety keep drawing people back, with
  many enjoying it as a solid pick for casual outings or groups. It's easy to
  see why this place earns high marks, as the positives like generous portions
  and a clean vibe far outweigh any minor hiccups. If you're hunting for
  reliable sushi near you, this option often leaves diners feeling content and
  eager to return.
