        Had a great experience at Sapa. The lamb sautÃ© bento box really
        impressed--huge portion for just $18, and the lamb was coated in a
        flavorful, rich sauce with just the right amount of heat. The salad on
        the side was crisp and refreshing, especially with the light, citrusy
        dressing that balanced out the meal nicely.


        We also shared the calamari, which was a standout. Super crispy with a
        light, airy batter, and the dipping sauce had a sweet and sour blend
        that had a subtle Southeast Asian vibe--really addictive. It came out
        hot and fresh, and the portion was generous.


        The sashimi plate was beautifully presented and tasted just as fresh as
        it looked. The sauce on the side was unique--not something I've tried
        before, but it complemented the fish in a really cool way. Definitely
        better quality sashimi than what I've seen at most other spots around
        SLC.


        Service was attentive and friendly throughout, and we only waited about
        5-10 minutes for a table, even on a busy lunch.


        Overall, Sapa delivered on both flavor and value. Solid spot if you're
        craving Japanese or fusion in the area.

        I loved everything about this place, and Iâm not even a sushi guy.


        I was able to make my own custom roll, I call it the Brady Rollâ¦anyway,
        super good. It was basically a sushi version of a burrito.


        Fantastic food, and great service!

        I loved the layout, decorations, and especially the patio at Sapa Sushi.
        I wish it had been summer so I couldâve enjoyed dining outside. The
        prices are fair, and the ingredients were very fresh. Customer service
        was excellent, and the space is accommodating for large groups.


        The sushi was deliciousânot extraordinary, but made with good-quality
        ingredients. One thing they should improve is their table cleaning
        process. The washcloth they used had a noticeable humidity smell, which
        was not appealing.


        Overall, it was a good experience, and Iâd recommend it!

        Terrific dinner experience at Sapa! Our party of nine were graciously
        handled with just a 20 minute wait on a Friday night. The place was
        packed so the hostâs skills at getting us seats was much appreciated.


        Water glasses were already filled when we got to our table. Nice touch.
        Menus are a QR code scan away. The menu is huge but not in a certain
        inexplicably popular purveyor of cheesecake and microwaved entrees kind
        of way. Our server was delightful allowing us plenty of time to find
        what suited our wide array of palettes, including three children and one
        decidedly anti-sushi adult.


        Starters included edamame, spicy edamame, pork dumplings (a big hit!),
        and the filet mignon bites. My daughter, in an act of blasphemy, ordered
        that medium well, but it was still a treat. The chef managed to keep the
        filet tender enough to save it from medium well Hell.


        The children and the lone anti-sushi adult slammed down their drunken
        noodles and garlic noodles. Note on the garlic noodles - the garlic
        level is turned up to 11 and will allow you to repel vampires for
        months.


        Sushi-wise, we got the Tataki, Vegas, Shrimp Crunchy and a couple of
        others whose names escape me. The flavors though do not. Each one packed
        taste in every bite. It doesnât punch you in the face though, subtle is
        the key as shrimp or ahi and avocado mix with rice and wasabi. It also
        screams fresh. Thereâs no overly fishy smell here, which declares the
        fish is fresh and real. No crab is spelled with a âkâ here.


        Looking forward to coming back!

        This is my favourite spot for sushi. I live in Lehi but always want to
        go there for sushi, it's worth the drive. The food never disappointed
        (especially fillet mignon & margaritas). The price is very reasonable.
        That's why they always busy.
