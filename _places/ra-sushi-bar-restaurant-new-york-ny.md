        Visiting NYC with my son and bestie. We decided to grab sushi and went
        to RA as it was close to our hotel in Times Square. The food was
        delicious. The drinks were crafty and tasty. Our server, Nicole, was so
        sweet and helpful. She helped my vegetarian friend find safe choices on
        the menu, and was perfectly attentive. Somehow, she always knew when we
        needed something and appeared like a magic fairy. It was such a good
        experience that we will likely return before our trip is over.

        This place is the place to be if you want delicious food, great mood,
        and fast service. The manager is such a friendly person, he goes around
        to make sure everything is running smoothly. This place has an eye for
        detail as the decoration makes you feel away from the city. Especially
        the DJ playing music to get you in the feels. All negative feelings fade
        away when eating from the food. I speak from experience, you’ll never
        forget coming to this place. Food is AMAZING!!!! 💜

        I had an amazing experience at Ra Sushi. The food was so amazing and the
        service was top tier. We had an amazing server that made sure that we
        were taken care of and the manager was super personable and a joy to
        speak with. 10/10 would recommend you try out Ra Sushi. The vibe,
        atmosphere, and service was outstanding.

        The BEST happy hour on Times Square! The fish is always fresh. The
        presentation never disappoints. What makes me want to come again is the
        staff’s personality. The restaurant is beautiful. The attention to
        detail is something I notice and the reason why I keep coming back.
        Loved the D.J. on Friday night! The happy hour menu is insane!! I love
        sushi and this is my new favorite spot :-)

        If you love sushi, this is definitely the place for you! We arrived
        close to closing time, and the staff was kind enough to let us sit down
        and enjoy our meal. Everyone was super friendly, and the atmosphere,
        along with the music, made for a really chill and enjoyable dining
        experience.


        We ordered the California roll and shrimp tempura roll, both of which
        were fresh and delicious. For dessert, we had the trio
        mochi—unfortunately, there’s no picture because I couldn’t wait and dove
        right in! It was just too good to stop for a photo.


        Highly recommend this spot for great sushi and a relaxing vibe!
