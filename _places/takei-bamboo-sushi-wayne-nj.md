        pretty decent and good sushi spot. My local sushi place is closed on
        Tuesdays so im glad Takei is open those days.


        First visit and i didnt expect inside to be spacious. Its pretty clean
        and well kempt too. Took about 30mins to get order ready for pickup but
        understandable since i didnt really see a lot of staff.


        Sushi was fresh and tasted pretty good. We had the Takei special but I
        feel like ive tried those before (from other places) so wasnt really
        surprised. I was looking for something new or creative so im hoping to
        try more from the menu especially from the specials. Place has been here
        for a long time and for good reason. Glad I gave it a go!

        Accidentally found this spot, turned out to be the best experience!


        Service here 10/10

        Had an amazing time

        *Special thanks to the chef for being so considerate and making a roll
        with cooked salmon for my mom. She doesn’t like eating raw fish.


        Definitely my new go to spot in NJ 🥰

        I love this place. Been here twice as of 9/22/22. It’s sorda like a
        hidden little gem. Located in a small plaza and there’s always parking.
        It’s super low key, very clean, sweet and cozy. The service is fast and
        the food is delicious. I already have my “ top sushi spots”  that I
        adore  in NJ but this one is now added to the list ♥️.

        Great traditional Japanese spot with first-class service. Was shocking
        find we found randomly. All the fish was very fresh, sweet, not fishy at
        all. The salmon was my favorite, tender and buttery. Rolls were tight,
        well rolled. There was a surprising amount of free stuff: edamame, miso
        soup, special roll, and even free ice cream mochi with the check. I felt
        like a celebrity. It's rare to see places offering complimentary items
        much anymore. Their customer service here is on par with Japan,
        definitely coming back. I love the ceramic tea cups here also.


        I was having a really bad week. Thank you so much to this place for the
        healing happy experience. 😊
