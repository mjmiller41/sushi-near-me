        My new go-to restaurant! The food is amazing. If you are vegan or gluten
        free, you’ll be shocked by how many choices there are. As in an ENTIRE
        vegan menu with over 60 options front and back! The flavors and textures
        were tremendous. Can’t recommend this place enough. Pictures don’t do
        justice.

        amazing vegan options! this cute little japanese restaurant has a full
        vegan menu with about a million sushi options. we got four rolls and all
        were amazing- v14 was the clear favorite. the service was friendly and
        prompt and the place was clean. there’s a big table set up in the middle
        for takeout, which does bring the ambience down a tad for dining in, but
        we wish we lived in the area so we could frequent this spot on the reg!

        Delicious sushi with a completely separate and extensive vegan menu.  
        The food was excellent and service was outstanding.  Parking was a issue
        as it was street parking and I the weekend.  Regardless this place is so
        worth going to!

        As someone who rally goes to Japanese places anymore because of the lack
        of creative vegiterian options, we were blown away at how many options
        they had.  There was an entire menu just for vegiterian options which
        was probably around 30-40 choices.


        We got the pickle pickle, JVL, Avacado crunch, and spicy girl.  Our
        favorites were definitly the Avacado crunch and pickle pickle for their
        good texture and flavors.  The other two weren’t as exciting. The JVL
        was a bunch of fried stuff which I was expecting to have more of a
        crunch but it was more chewy and the spicy girl was a bit one note as
        well.


        The hot sake was good but wasn’t very warm.  We got some for all of us
        and they ranged from Luke warm to slightly warmer.  It was still decent
        sake so it didn’t take away too much from it.


        The service was great and the atmosphere was pretty decent as well. 
        Overall a good place with an incredible amount of vegiterian options.
