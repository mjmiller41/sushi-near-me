        I can’t say enough great things about OKu Charleston! From start to
        finish, our experience was exceptional. The food was absolutely
        incredible, the atmosphere was vibrant and inviting, and our server went
        above and beyond to make our night special. They even surprised me by
        decorating our table for my birthday, complete with a thoughtful gift
        and extra touches that made the evening unforgettable. It was truly the
        perfect place to celebrate! My best friend was so impressed that she
        immediately said, ‘We’re coming back for my birthday!“

        An Unforgettable Anniversary Dinner!


        We celebrated our 9-year anniversary at Oku and it was truly a stellar
        experience from start to finish. Hands down, the best sushi we’ve had in
        Charleston! Every bite was fresh, flavorful, and expertly crafted.


        The ambiance was perfect—not too loud, so we could actually enjoy a
        conversation without shouting. The service was top-notch; they were
        incredibly attentive to our allergy restrictions, ensuring everything
        was safe and delicious. To top it off, they surprised us with
        complimentary drinks and food, making our night even more special.


        If you’re looking for an exceptional dining experience with outstanding
        sushi and impeccable service, this is the place to go. We can’t wait to
        come back!

        First time here, and it’s now my favorite sushi spot in Charleston!


        Food: The menu features unique ingredient combinations. We tried the
        Dragon, Potato, and Salmon with Lemon rolls—all were delicious, but the
        Potato roll was my favorite. The salmon was the best I’ve ever had:
        thick, juicy. Food deserves 11/10!


        Service: Our waiter was friendly and complimented each of our choices,
        which was nice, but I’d rather hear is once or twice to be more
        authentic with compliments. They kept our water glasses full and guided
        us through the menu. also waiter asked about food restitutions. I
        appreciated that since I am pescatarian. Amazing staff—thank you!


        Space: The design is impressive. We sat by the windows overlooking King
        Street. There’s also a bar area where you can watch the chefs prepare
        sushi, adding a special touch to the experience.


        It’s a pricier place. We paid $110, including tip, for two people but
        left happy and full. My husband hates leaving a restaurant hungry, so we
        ordered plenty and were satisfied.

        Such fantastic service and a fun Omakase experience. Nontraditional but
        they brought all different plates with tons of food for each course with
        the final round being the chef's Nigiri special. Certainly the best
        course with bold flavors and fresh classic Japanese ingredients. Our
        waiter Sam was fabulous and we even met the head chef, Max. They made
        the experience for our group of 11 very seamless and memorable!

        Celebrations for a friend's birthday were held last weekend at O-ku. Try
        the Tokyo Wings - Wing Perfection Beyond Compare. Karen's main dish was
        the Salmon Sushi, "The Playboy Rolls" with a great surprise crunch in
        the center. And the Birthday 🍨 dessert was various flavors of  Mochi
        Ice Cream. We rate O-ku 5 Stars for Overall Great Experience 🥢 DLK
