        I have dined at many Asian restaurants, but this one truly stands out as
        the best I have ever experienced. From the moment you walk in, the
        elegant yet cozy ambiance sets the perfect mood for an exceptional
        dining experience. The attention to detail in the decor, the warm
        lighting, and the welcoming staff make you feel instantly at home.


        The menu offers a diverse selection of authentic Asian dishes, each
        crafted with high-quality ingredients and presented beautifully. Whether
        you’re in the mood for sushi, dim sum, or a rich, flavorful curry, every
        dish is cooked to perfection. The flavors are bold yet balanced, with
        every bite showcasing the skill of the chefs. One of my personal
        favorites is the winner, which is packed with umami flavors and cooked
        to melt-in-your-mouth perfection. The sushi is also some of the freshest
        I’ve had, with expertly sliced fish and well-seasoned rice.


        While the price is on the higher side, it is absolutely worth every
        penny. The quality, portion sizes, and overall experience make it a
        worthwhile indulgence. I have been here so many times, and I will
        continue to return. If you’re looking for an unforgettable Asian dining
        experience, this restaurant should be at the top of your list!

        We had a great experience here, the food was amazing our waitress
        Camilla was great, she went through the whole menu made some great
        recommendations and the food itself lived up. Only thing I wasn’t as
        satisfied with was the chocolate lava cake was a bit lacking but the ice
        cream was stellar and the fish and rolls were phenomenal. We will
        definitely be coming back!

        This was our second time at this amazing sushi restaurant, and it
        certainly won’t be our last! The food was incredible, as always, with
        every dish being fresh and full of flavor. Chef Marlon was so kind and
        welcoming. He remembered us from our last visit and even made special
        dishes just for us, which made the experience feel even more personal.
        We truly appreciate the attention to detail and hospitality. We’ll
        definitely be back again soon.

        Emilio was the best server. I knew I was in a sea of people, but as a
        lone diner, Emilio still made me feel like the only guest in the
        restaurant. The host, Anna, also made the experience wonderful start to
        finish. Fish was remarkable. Really beautifully crafted drinks as well.

        Good sushi but insanely overpriced for the quality and portion size,
        even for a sushi restaurant. Probably won’t go back as there are other
        better quality options at same, if not less, price point. Even the
        ambiance wasn’t good enough to hook us in.


        We got a ton on the menu to try a few things.

        - Cocktails were okay. Got a cherry blossom-themed one but tasted more
        like cough syrup than fruity drink.

        - Wagyu buns were expensive but the bun was kinda crispy. Didn’t have
        that fluffy texture you’d expect to find.

        - Sushi selections and rolls were good but nothing really wowed us. The
        main stand out was the Green Day roll, which was our favorite from the
        pack.

        - Uni and Squid Ink pastas were tasty but way too expensive (~$50) for
        each order. It took two bits to eat each bowl! Check out photos to see
        how small the size is.


        Service was attentive despite it being a fully packed weekend night.


        The food was good, not great, and with the bill being over $400 for only
        three people we can confidently say this place wasn’t worth the price
        tag… even for us regular sushi and omakase goers.
