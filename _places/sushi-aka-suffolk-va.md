        We love this restaurant! Hands down the BEST sushi/sashimi in Hampton
        Roads area and abroad. You know it’s going to be a quality sushi
        restaurant when the sushi chef owns it. It’s a small intimate
        atmosphere, and their staff is only a few people. Everyone who works
        there is like a family. Every dish including the desserts are made in
        house, and they use fresh seasonal produce sourced from local farms. If
        you’re not 100% a fan of sushi or fish they have some incredible pork,
        beef and chicken dishes as well. Sometimes they’ll feature Kobe beef
        cuts. Yum! Our family loves sushi and most of the time when we order
        takeout or dine in we give them a budget for a sushi platter, and tell
        them what our likes and dislikes are and Chef Mike will create an
        amazing assortment for us. A home run every time. During cooler months
        they’ll have pork belly ramen, which my daughter craves it’s so good.
        All around I highly recommend Sushi Aka to everyone who visits Suffolk
        or lives in the area. I’ve met people from Richmond who make it a
        special point to eat there. It’s a gem in downtown Suffolk. Support
        local small businesses and help local math!

        We love this restaurant! Hands down the BEST sushi/sashimi in Hampton
        Roads area and abroad. You know it’s going to be a quality sushi
        restaurant when the sushi chef owns it. It’s a small intimate
        atmosphere, and their staff is only a few people. Everyone who works
        there is like a family. Every dish including the desserts are made in
        house, and they use fresh seasonal produce sourced from local farms. If
        you’re not 100% a fan of sushi or fish they have some incredible pork,
        beef and chicken dishes as well. Sometimes they’ll feature Kobe beef
        cuts. Yum! Our family loves sushi and most of the time when we order
        takeout or dine in we give them a budget for a sushi platter, and tell
        them what our likes and dislikes are and Chef Mike will create an
        amazing assortment for us. A home run every time. During cooler months
        they’ll have pork belly ramen, which my daughter craves it’s so good.

        We had a really good experience. Food is awesome and service is good.
        The atmosphere is a bit dark lighting so elders have to use a flashlight
        on their phone to see. First, the chef offers a tasty free tuna and
        avocado starter. I got a Roppongi drink and it was great! The chicken
        teriyaki is SO good. The rainbow roll is so good too!! It’s dessert week
        so they offered a banana split and strawberry cheesecake and they were
        to DIE for! Definitely recommend checking this place out! Mike is
        awesome!

        Wow! Just wow! This hidden gem is a MUST VISIT! Dinner here was
        absolutely amazing from start to finish. The service was superb, the
        staff was very friendly and extremely attentive, I couldn't ask for
        better.


        We got the calamari and one of the appetizer specials. Both were
        awesome. The dipping sauce for the calamari was on another level!


        My friend and I both got platters, he got the 40 piece sashimi combo and
        I got the chef's choice platter. The food was absolutely stunning. The
        quality was immaculate, some of the best sushi I've had outside of
        Japan.


        I ordered dessert, got the blackberry swirl icecream, it was stunning!


        All in all an outstanding experience. I'll definitely be back and I
        cannot express how highly I recommend this place.

        The most authentic sushi and sashimi place I ever tasted here in
        Virginia! We were station in Japan for 3 years and I fall in love with
        their culture, place and food. We’ve been here 5 years now, so far this
        is the best place I found. This place is so amazing and so authentic
        sushi, specially the sashimi! AKA is local and own by the chief that
        work closely with the famous Japanese sushi chef from Philadelphia! I
        don’t know if you’re that craze with sushi and sashimi to drive an hour
        away but it’s all worth it! It’s the closest one from authentic Japanese
        sushi and sashimi! From their salad, appetizer, main course, up to
        dessert (red bean cream brûlée) ! Even their alcohol is really good!.

        Highly recommended!

        Excellent! We've been dying for a real sushi spot....Finally! Everything
        was fabulous! We had the chef's sashimi/sushi combo, uni soup, toro,
        cheesecake- try it all! Fish was fresh, there was a wonderful selection.
        Our waitress was also so sweet. My only complaint is that we did pay for
        something that we never received as we ordered a lot, so something got
        lost in the shuffle of bringing many dishes out. We will still return,
        we absolutely enjoyed our meal!
