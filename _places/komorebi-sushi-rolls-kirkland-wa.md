        This is a hidden gem! Our party of 6 got right in!  I ordered the mixed
        poke bowl without rice and extra veggies; delicious!!!

        My husband and daughter ordered the crunchy California, spicy
        California, and shrimp tempura rolls. They say the rolls were flavorful,
        spicy, and perfectly sized!

        I only have a photo of the poke bowl because a roll is a roll 😉

        Ordered Salmon box and it was so cute how it was displayed and for the
        price it was pretty good. It came with a bowl of miso soup and salad. We
        asked if we ordered online for pick-up if the soup/salad sides will come
        with it, and they confirmed they do.


        Udon noodles were nice chewy texture, the broth was very tasty and not
        bland.

        Mixed poke bowl was confirmed yummy by family member :)

        Fish tasted fresh and not fishy. We have a family member very picky on
        fish. She is not a fan of raw fish except for spicy tuna rolls. But
        tasting some of the mixed poke, she confirmed no fishy taste or smell,
        she was able to enjoy the food.


        Very cute small restaurant, went after 5pm on a Friday so it was not
        busy. But the road to get there was busy due to costco shoppers

        Their fish is of superior quality compared to other Japanese restaurants
        in this area. I used to live in Japan for a long time so when I feel
        like eating Japanese food I always go to this one. I am a routine
        customer and I always order their salmon box, which they remember every
        time.

        Such an amazing restaurant! The food was unbelievably fresh and
        delicious, and the service was incredible. They also accommodated a
        gluten free member of our party very well! Overall this place is
        absolutely a hidden treasure. If I could give 6 stars I would. I hope
        this restaurant gets more publicity because it is the best sushi
        restaurant in all of the Kirkland. I am not even exaggerating, this
        restaurant was an absolute 10/10. HIGHLY recommend!
