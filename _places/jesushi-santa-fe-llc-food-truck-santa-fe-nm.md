        Decided to get the sashimi salad (medium hot)

        Looks delicious, this is no doubt the best sushi in Santa Fe, always
        fresh, I just wish they were open til 6 so we could pick it up after
        work.

        He gave me tamari & will help make sure ur food is gluten free


        I wish they were open later 😭😭😭


        Jesushi (pronounced Hey -sushi. Spanish pronunciation)  Is the best
        sushi I've had in ages and certainly the best sushi I've had in New
        Mexico, currently they're having issue with online ordering so please
        order by phone until they fix that issue.


        I got a secret item and I am super impressed.

        This sushi burrito is perfectly rolled & didn't fall apart like so many
        others I have had, the microgreens were a nice touch, they have
        vegetarian & gluten free options they might be able to do vegan, call
        and check first.  The rice to fish ratio was perfect one piece of fish I
        had was a bit hard to eat it was a little hard to bite apart but I'm not
        giving points off for that it did not negatively impact my experience at
        all. Next time I'm gonna ask for the pickled ginger & wasabi on the
        burrito.


        I will suggest one thing I've had on my mind since I've had sushi
        burritos & had fusion goods,  maybe they can do a ceviche roll?


        They could make ceviche, load it into a roll & cut it or put it into a
        sushi burrito with some extra goods like micro greens or whatever sounds
        good, maybe thinly sliced lemon on top of the roll, if they do make this
        I hope they keep a gluten free option available.

        It sounds like a match made in heaven.


        my favorite rolls are sometimes hard to find :

        Cucumber wrapped roll

        Inari nigiri

        And also anything with octopus


        They do not these options but they have amazing food and great service I
        hope at some point they can offer some of these

        (And a ceviche roll & maybe dedicated sushi burritos)

        Decided to get the sashimi salad (medium hot)

        Looks delicious, this is no doubt the best sushi in Santa Fe, always
        fresh, I just wish they were open til 6 so we could pick it up after
        work.

        Honestly was kind of skeptical about sushi from a food truck...I could
        not have been more wrong. This place is honestly pumping out some super
        high quality rolls and the people were super nice and pleasant to deal
        with. Everything was delicious and the Miso soup was better than most
        restaurants here in town. Will be going back often for sure!

        Wow! This sushi is better quality than some of the sushi restaurants in
        the northern part of town! The sushi rice they're making is spot on. I
        got the Jesushi Roll which was delicious, and a Spicy Tuna Roll which
        had a healthy serving of Tuna, which I don't always find at other
        places. Plus I found the prices quite reasonable. I'll definitely be
        back to try that Jalapeño-sushi-Popper.

        P.S. The guy running the window was very kind and helpful!

        Good fresh sushi. Made while you wait and it shows, all the ingredients
        tasted fresh, light and tasty. Our favorite Sushi in Santa Fe. Picnic
        table and seats available just outside the truck.
