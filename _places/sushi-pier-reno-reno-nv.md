        Have you ever had a week where you had to make so many decisions, that
        by the time you got to Friday, you couldn’t make one more decision?!?
        That was me tonight… and boy am I glad I found this place for dinner!


        Sat at the sushi bar and the chef knew what to prep 🙌  Super chill
        place, with fantastic sushi at a great price! Loved the Mountain with
        all tuna 😋


        Will definitely be back!

        Here’s a place that does vary on quality based on chefs on shift,
        however they have obviously done something to fix this compared to
        previous times I’ve come about 1-2 yrs ago. Didn't stop going because of
        quality just mainly didn’t work in there area anymore.


        We went on off peak hours I’d say as most of their traffic is the lunch
        rush daily considering the amount of business workers that flock to the
        area for food.


        Chicken katsu skewers:

        If you have texture problems this can be a gamble however the chefs
        tonight did great! I got the dinner entree which includes three skewers,
        rice, tonkatsu sauce, edamame, a cabbage salad, miso soup, and an orange
        slice. The chicken was not that fatty and fried great, my bone to pick
        is I’ve always hated the skewers themselves as you’ll only get about
        three good dips in the sauce before you are ripping the meat off the
        stick. Also I’ve always hated the dressing they put in the salad, this
        is a personal gripe as the sauce is sweet, creamy, and tangy and in my
        opinion could be left off the plate entirely. I like the edamame as a
        buffer when I’m eating so much carbs and again the orange slice and kale
        garnish could be left off the plate as well if they are sent back
        regularly untouched.


        Potstickers:

        A small throw in here they are the most mild or mid potstickers you’ll
        get. Not the best but good to eat and not really something you’ll crave
        after eating either. The sauce they produce is ok but it tastes way to
        strong of Wasabi in a way and is not pleasant or complementing to the
        flavors of the potsticker. In my experience the best dipping sauce for
        these is actually the tonkatsu sauce.


        All you can eat sushi:

        Def recommend coming here for the sushi, usually fresh and well made and
        of course will vary on the chef making it. Tonight we got a more
        generous helping of sauces and garnish with the sushi and although I
        couldn’t get pictures of all that my partner ate you can see the
        presentation is beautiful.


        In conclusion I could tell they made an effort to improve and as a side
        note even save a bit on their order sheets by doing a three mark system
        now (our order pictured below). If you like sushi give it a try and if
        you like chicken katsu be open to what you might get.

        We eat here almost any time we visit Reno for the weekend. Over a dozen
        times so far. My wife loves the selection. Priced reasonably, especially
        the all you can eat. Staff is always pleasant and the restaurant is
        clean. I prefer sitting at the table and filling out an order instead of
        trying to shout my order. Plan to keep visiting.
