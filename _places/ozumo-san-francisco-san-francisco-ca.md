        I sat at Ozumo for a solo lunch date and what an amazing experience.
        Everyone was super friendly and professional. Luke, my server was the
        best! He helped me pick out some items off the menu and all of his
        suggestions were DELICIOUS! The fish is so fresh. The wagyu nigiri is to
        die for! The Giddy Geisha?… give me 14 more please!! lol The

        Despite not having a reservation, we were able to walk in and find a
        table. It was our first visit, and we were warmly greeted and seated in
        the main dining room. The waitress promptly arrived with menus and
        offered us drinks.


        The food was excellent, with the exception of the tuna tartare, which
        lacked a strong tuna flavor and was overwhelmed by other ingredients. I
        particularly enjoyed the Ozumo Unagi and Shrimp Tempura rolls. The
        atmosphere was pleasant, and everything appeared clean and tidy.


        Overall, we had a positive experience. While the nigiri and sashimi
        offerings seemed a bit overpriced compared to some other restaurants,
        they were still delicious. I would definitely return for the rolls.

        Great experience overall besides the $10 water! Bring your own water or
        ask specifically for tap water (i thought “still water” was free)


        Fish was creamy and fresh, and I especially liked the otoro and gindara
        (miso black cod). Food was served decently fast and well-timed.

        I recently dined at a Ozumo. The sushi was outstanding, with each piece
        prepared with precision and care. The gyoza were perfectly crisp and
        flavorful, serving as an excellent appetizer to the meal. I was also
        impressed with their old-fashioned drink, which was expertly crafted and
        paired surprisingly well with the sushi.


        A special mention goes to George, the sushi chef, who made the
        experience even more memorable. His skill and attention to detail were
        evident in every bite, and his friendly demeanor added a personal touch
        to the evening.


        Overall, this restaurant is a must-visit for anyone who appreciates
        high-quality sushi and a well-made cocktail. I'll definitely be
        returning soon!
