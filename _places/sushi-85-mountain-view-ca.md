        I was starving, and I went to the random shop nearby. The quality of the
        food didn’t disappoint me. Will go there again.

        I wanted to like it to support the shop but it was okay. There were
        parts that were tasty but when we got the bill, it was not worth that
        much. We ordered a ramen tonkatsu. The pork and noodles were great but
        the broth started to taste too salty after awhile. The seaweed around
        the sushi seemed hard to bite into, I guess I like crispy seaweed. My
        brother got a bento with mackerel and tempura. I took the shrimp, it had
        a nice crisp and taste to it. After the first bite of mackerel, my
        brother got a fish bone and that ruined it for him. He gave it to me, I
        added lemon and ate it with rice. It was pretty tasty. We ordered a
        spider maki, seemed not enough soft shell crab. Our favorite was 85, it
        had a lot of different fish. The Umami was ok, the veggies in the sushi
        were not our favorite and the poke seemed flavorless. Service was nice.

        TL;DR: 15$ worth All-you-can-eat at best, but their price: 50$.


        I have a very wide range of tolerance in terms of food, meaning very few
        restaurants fall into either ends of the spectrum from terrible to
        phenomenal. This place is on the wrong end of the spectrum.

        I've been to sushi factory, Kenzo's AYCE menu, Tomi Seafood buffet, and
        lots of other buffet/AYCE places. Granted, my experience are mostly
        pre-COVID. And I get that restaurants have to raise prices because of
        hard times and staff demanding higher pay, and I get that. Pre-COVID,
        most places charge roughly 25$ per person for sushi/seafood AYCE. If
        I've got to pay 30$ or 35$ now, still understandable, but certainly not
        50$ per.


        I came here thinking if they charge 50$ per, it must be really good. How
        mistaken I was. Their menu is pretty much the same if not worse than
        Kenzo's (no justification for higher price here). Getting an annual
        membership with Kenzo and get sashimi with them is cheaper than this
        place's per person prize (even less justification for higher price
        here). Now this may sound like I'm advertising for Kenzo, but I've got
        no stake in the place. It's just easier to have a bar to compare to and
        see how far this Sushi 85 place have fallen.


        As for the food quality, terrible! And I don't say that lightly nor
        often. They pack so much rice in the rolls, so little fish, scrap pieces
        of fish at that. Again, for 50$, I expect a lot better. I'm not one to
        comment on freshness but the fish definitely smells. By the end of it I
        can't taste any fish, just vinegar rice in my mouth. And to top off the
        horrible experience, when the wait staff ask for somebody more senior to
        help calculate the left over pieces we didn't finish (again, couldn't
        taste anything but vinegar rice at this point), Chinese was the first
        thing came out of his mouth. Yes, this place is run by Chinese, that
        assumes every other Asian-looking people are Chinese and show you no
        respect. Does it sound like I'm splitting hair? Yes. But at this point
        it's another drop in the bucket of things that make this place bad.


        Sushi 85 has earned its place on my black list. Never again. Don't waste
        your money on this place.
