        We were treated to complimentary Konacha tea, though I would have
        preferred it to be served during the meal rather than at the end. The
        service was attentive, and the ambiance was cozy, enhanced by beautiful
        wall art. The only downside was the limited dessert menu.

        The Chicken Teriyaki was perfectly cooked—definitely among the best I’ve
        had. The "Sushi Regular," with eight pieces of sushi and one tuna roll,
        was fresh and flavorful, though the wasabi inside was a bit unexpected.
        The seaweed salad was delicious and beautifully presented.

        Beautiful and delicate food, beautiful balanced flavours and authentic.
        Some of the most tender and tasty outside of Japan.


        Cannot understand the negative reviews other than to think they don’t
        know what good quality Japanese food is.

        We have dined at Sushi of Gari on the Upper West Side twice, once in the
        restaurant a long time ago, and then again for takeout tonight. The
        sushi has been great on both occasions. It's not my favorite Japanese in
        Manhattan, but along with Sushi Yasaka, it is definitely the best
        Japanese cuisine on the Upper West Side. Gari is the more formal
        experience while Sushi Yasaka is more laid back. Both places are great.

        *Okay granted this is partially our fault buttttt - we asked the waiter
        for a recommendation for sake. The waiter provided us 3 small samples to
        try but he did not offer to share the price of the bottle nor did we
        ask. When the bill came, we found out it cost us $220!!! I felt like
        this was dishonest and put a damper on our otherwise wonderful meal.

        Ambiance (5/5): The establishment is pretty small but very organized and
        neat, clean, and welcoming! We were seated next to the chef's table and
        loved watching the preparation right in front of our eyes. The chefs
        worked together seamlessly to prepare the various dishes with special
        garnishes, sauces, and presentation.

        Service (4/5): We were warmly greeted at the door. Warm towels for
        wiping at the beginning of the meal and during the middle course.

        He went out of his way to ask us in advance if we wanted a birthday
        dessert since there was only 2 left in the back so he could reserve it.
        They came out with a sparkler candle for us! Free green tea with the
        dessert.

        Food (5/5): We chose the combo omakase for $180 (4 sashimi & 8 sushi).
        Every single dish was fresh and delicious! Presentation was exceptional
        and the tastes were infused with art.

        After nearly 20 years, Gari remains one of our family’s favorite omakase
        places! The fresh fishes, their rice and unique sauces make Gari’s sushi
        among the best. Service is impeccable.
