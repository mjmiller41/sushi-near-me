        Very nice atmosphere and good sushi, no loud music blaring. We went on
        NYE and the service was great. I had the honey walnut shrimp sushi roll,
        the Philly role, gyoza, and ebi nigiri. All of it was fresh and
        delicious. The Asahi beer was really good too, I hadn't had that kind
        before.


        Instead of ordering a la carte, everything on their dinner menu is
        included in an all you can eat for $33 per person. However, the menu
        notes that you will be charged accordingly for leftovers, which is
        pretty smart to discourage people from making a lot of waste or trying
        to take home a bunch of extras for free.

        Note: ice tea does not come with refills, but they did give us a free
        order of donuts at the end, which was very kind of them.

        I love sushi! So I decided to give this place a chance, and I was not
        disappointed. Sashimi was delicious and perfectly cut. The caterpillar
        role was also very delicious.

        I do not recommend this place.


        The 3 stars is for the speed of service, easy to eat portions, and
        relative affordability for AYCE. Food comes super fast, at the cost of
        being poorly assembled sometimes. It’s 5 pieces per roll, so you can try
        a variety without feeling too burdened. The cost for weekends or dinner
        is $33/person.


        The food is just not very good. The worst part is that they can’t even
        cook rice right. RICE. At a SUSHI restaurant! It’s insanely dense and
        unpleasant to chew and of course they’d add sooo much of it to
        everything.


        The fish was consistently bland with some highs and lows. The fish on
        the nigiri wasn’t bad, but it doesn’t taste great either.


        I forgot to take a picture of this one but I did enjoy the salmon in the
        spicy assorted sashimi side specifically. It’s a nice pile of cubed
        salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. My partner ate the yellowtail and it had a
        mushy, poorly thawed frozen texture.


        Tried the 49ers roll, azukar roll, and bay scallop roll. 49ers is ok but
        the ratio of ingredients to rice is poor. Azukar roll was my favorite,
        probably cause it’s a fried maki roll and didn’t have an awful outer
        layer of rice lol. The bay scallop roll is extremely umami and a little
        sickening, but it’s fine with sriracha. The selection is not very
        diverse.


        Lastly we ordered sesame balls, it’s nice cause they can be ordered
        individually. They’re ok, I like how they’re petite. We asked what the
        donut on their menu is and the server said it’s just a normal sugar
        donut hole fyi.


        You can just go ahead and disregard the Asian food opinions of everyone
        raving about this being the best sushi ever lol. Just go literally
        anywhere else run by the Japanese or Koreans. Not trying to sound like a
        snob, I love cheap slightly low quality sushi. But this is NOT it. Don’t
        take your Asian friends and don’t take someone here for their first
        time. Sorry. The inside of the restaurant and servers were nice.

        I love Azukar Sushi! It's fresh made to order sushi all you can eat. Out
        off all other sushi places I have tried. This is my favorite. They have
        all my favorites which we ordered. The BBQ Albacore, Jalapeño Crispy,
        Super Dynamite

        , and many more. The price is decent. You make it up just by having 2-3
        different items.
