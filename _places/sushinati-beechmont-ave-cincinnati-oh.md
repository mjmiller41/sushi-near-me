        Food was great the atmosphere was peaceful and all. What I wasn’t aware
        of was the 75 cent charge on yum yum sauce. The lady was rude about
        taking it off as I was not made aware. On another note she basically
        rushed me out the door and there was no one there. Like let me slow down
        and eat and enjoy my food in peace. Lastly she forgot what I got to
        drink and she was the one taking my order.


        I’ll take my money to yummy bowl next door instead

        Food was great the atmosphere was peaceful and all. What I wasn’t aware
        of was the 75 cent charge on yum yum sauce. The lady was rude about
        taking it off as I was not made aware. On another note she basically
        rushed me out the door and there was no one there. Like let me slow down
        and eat and enjoy my food in peace. Lastly she forgot what I got to
        drink and she was the one taking my order.


        I’ll take my money to yummy bowl next door instead

        They cross contaminate raw sushi with fried sushi which was food for 2
        different people. The lady who claimed she was manager was very rude and
        claimed they do that not to “waste” boxes. Cross contamination is not
        good and not okay they refused to recook my order

        Sushinati was a fantastic dining experience! The ramen they serve is
        hands down the best I’ve had in a long time—rich, flavorful, and
        absolutely satisfying. I also loved the sushi; it was fresh and
        perfectly prepared. I highly recommend trying the Beechmont Roll, which
        was incredibly delicious. The only downside is that the location is
        pretty cramped, with limited seating, but the quality of the food
        definitely makes it worth it. The server was very friendly and made us
        feel welcome. If you visit, definitely try the ramen—it’s the best
        you'll ever have!

        This was so yummy! I had never l been here but my friends wanted sushi
        so we came here. I don't like sushi. I got the chicken fried rice stone
        bowl with a said of teriyaki. Came with the standard house salad. Very
        delicious!! Definitely want to come again. Stone bowl was $15. Not sure
        what my friends paid for their sushi but it looked awesome and they
        enjoyed it. This place gets really cramped when busy. Very small dining
        area with limited seating and tables are close together. There are a few
        outdoor seating tables if you would rather eat outside on a nice day.


        Update: I finally tried sushi....and I loved it! I noticed they had deep
        fried options on their menu so I took the plunge. I believe I got the
        Sunday morning. It was salmon in the sushi, deep fried and drizzled with
        eel sauce. Will definitely have to try more of the deep fried options.


        Edit: Each time has been great except we went over the weekend and
        Mikaila the server was not friendly and provided poor service. We
        overheard the table next to us mention she was rude to them as well. I
        hope to not see her next time I come back. I do not want her as my
        server.
