        hours as we were catching up and lost track of time but we kindly given
        our time and space. Good was good and service was exceptional. We don't
        live in Buffalo, far from it but if we come backs we would come back

        Vietnamese restaurant in close proximity to University of Buffalo.

        My son is now a student there, so will probably frequent this place
        often.


        The prices here are fair and the portions are well sized.

        On the morning we went, lots of things were not available, but I am keen
        to try their curry soup.


        We ordered the large size Pho, the laab salad and Pad Thai, all very
        decent and good.


        Bring cash, as credit card purchases have a fee.

        I made an order last night using the UberEats app, and upon opening my
        wonton soup I noticed something suspicious. On closer inspection it was
        an insect!!

        With many delicious Vietnamese places around Buffalo, this is one you
        need to avoid. Came here with a friend around lunch. The restaurant was
        completely empty and we were served quickly. We ordered two bowls of
        pho. The broth evoked feelings of sad beef water than a rich and
        flavorful broth. The pho was completely and utterly lackluster. Any
        instant ramen would be more satisfying than this. However, the most
        egregious and sick aspect of this restaurant for which I will never
        return, is that the prices on their menu do not reflect what we were
        charged. Every item we ordered was marked up a few dollars. Thank
        goodness we double checked the receipt before we paid. When I brought
        this up to the waitress, she seemed annoyed and changed the receipt to
        reflect the prices on the menu. I can't imagine how many times they got
        away with this with other customers. Please, save your time and money
        and go to any other Vietnamese restaurant or place in this plaza.

        Arrived at around 10pm on Friday night (12 Jul). Originally wanted pho
        and given the name of the restaurant, I thought they only served
        Vietnamese cuisine. It's a pretty broad menu with thai and sushi dishes
        as well. Not as many pho options as I hoped. Ordered Pad Thai with
        shrimp, it had decent flavouring and good portion size. I kept biting
        into an ingredient that was waaay too salty, couldn't place it though
        (might've been the scrambled egg). The red curry tasted like a mild
        version of an East Indian curry dish, good portion though.
