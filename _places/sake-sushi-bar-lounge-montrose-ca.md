        This is our go to sushi spot. We go here at least once a month. The
        other sushi spots are solid, but this is always where we end up coming
        back to and having the best experience. They treat you like family, and
        the food is delicious. Prices are reasonable, and well worth it.


        Great service. Our server Sarah was prompt, attentive, proactive,
        thoughtful, and friendly! Tasty sushi. We got salmon nigiri, salmon
        sashimi, jalapeño salmon roll, and tempura calamari roll; all delicious.
        We also got the Shumai appetizer - that was not too impactful as
        compared to the rest. Overall vibe is solid, the outdoor area could use
        a little tlc/refinement; but clean and down overall. One thing we would
        was that the outdoor tables were too tall for the chairs; or perhaps the
        chairs were too low. It made the eating seated position a bit awkward.
        But overall, great experience, quick service, no wait during prime
        dinner time. Friendly staff. Some parking on Honolulu, and a few lots
        south of the Main Street. One note, there is a martial arts school a few
        doors west of the restaurant, and during class pick-up/drop off it can
        get a little crowded. We were blocked in our car, which was parked on
        Honolulu,upon our exit around 8pm. We normally go to Blue Fish across
        the way. While Blue Fish has a nicer outdoor dining atmosphere, we felt
        Sake had better value, and portions. And their sushi was just as
        delicious.


        Our favorite dishes:


        Salmon nigiri

        Jalapeño Salmon Roll

        Jessica Roll (avocado, cucumber, shrimp tempura inside; tuna, salmon,
        avocado - outside)

        Garlic Chili Salmon Poke Bowl


        Amazing staff!!!! Love them.


        12.2025 update: still amazing! And shout out to Robert. He is a great
        server. Connects with you, remembers you and your order, and treats you
        like his family! He strikes the perfect balance of attentive, and
        non-intrusive. He is critical component of why we love coming here. He
        always elevates our experience, and we appreciate him a ton.

        This is a great restaurant on the beautiful street of Honolulu. It has a
        cozy atmosphere and kind staff. The sashimi was tasty and the flavors
        were balanced. Totally would recommend! They could improve the bathroom
        a bit though...

        That was my second time eating here. I got the pork ramen. The broth was
        one of the best I have ever had. My mom loves the music. My grandpa says
        it is too much food, but he keeps eating it. My dad kept stealing my
        ramen, and  my brother loves his udon. I also love decorations which
        give a great impression. Although I am just a kid, I know that this
        place great Japanese cuisine.

        Our server (Alice) was very kind and helpful. Popped in for a quick bite
        - food was tasty and beautiful (and fast).


        So good, we came back the same night to eat more when we had more time!
