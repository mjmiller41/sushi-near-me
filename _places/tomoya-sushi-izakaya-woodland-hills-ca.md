        Great experience very friendly staff ready to meet your every need. Came
        here with my gym league basketball team, go team yellow(if you know you
        know) and we had a blast drinking miso soup and diving down on some
        fantastic rolls. So yummy and also delicious will definitely be
        recommending this to the pickle ball fellas!

        This was a good find! I happen to get over here during the week. The
        sushi chef "Ken" was entertaining very talkative and a great sushi chef.
        It was a nice relaxing evening the place wasn't too crowded parking was
        easy and the mail for two of us was around $100. I will go back!  They
        had a very nice variety of rolls. The albacore spicy sashimi was
        delicious.

        *This is NOT an all you eat sushi place *


        Fun sushi spot with lots of sushi and a few non sushi items. Itâs
        definitely a little bit more on the pricier side than other sushi places
        in town but you canât go wrong with the fresh fish. I got the crunchy
        shrimp tempura roll and it was delicious. I love the eel sauce it comes
        with. We got a couple other sushiâs to try. They have some great non
        rice sushi options as well.


        I deducted one star for service. I had to ask for soy sauce twice and a
        glass of water twice before it was given to me. We had about three
        different waiters so Iâm not sure if it all got mixed in between the
        people switching out but service is an area of improvement. I love the
        ambiance of this spot. They have both indoor and outdoor seating.

        Loved this place. The atmosphere was great, choices of a booth or the
        sushi bar, which both are nice and clean.


        Service, was great they were nice and helpful with any questions or
        suggestions


        Food, was great, I tried their chefs special the dragon ballz which was
        great, in my pictures it's the with flower looking piece. Also had the
        desert Crispy Haven which was a treat.


        Overall, loved this place.

        Great food! Clam miso soup was great! Sushi was great. The staff were
        super friendly and had our food out quick. Lots of parking near by.
        Didnât feel sick the next day, thatâs a bonus in my book. 10/10
