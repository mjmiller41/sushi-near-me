        Long time sushi lover here. Got delivery and their sushi was not good. I
        ordered nigiri and 2 specialty rolls, as well as 2 miso soups. They only
        gave the driver 1 soup to deliver. The salmon nigiri does not look or
        taste like the salmon that I have had at any other sushi place. Salmon
        has that distinctive taste that I can't describe.....this was not it. It
        just wasn't good. And it's a strange lite orange color, it looks off.
        I'm not even going to finish it. The inferno roll was really bad. And
        the cheese streak roll has too much mayo. The cooked kobe beef on the
        cheese steak roll was the best tasting thing in our whole order. So
        maybe their cooked food is good? My wife just said that she has never
        had bad sushi, ever until today. They trick you into using door dash. I
        would not have ordered if I knew it was door dash. Also, I called to let
        them know that I only received 1 soup(ordered 2). The guy on the phone
        said that I could go pick it up. I told him that he could just refund
        the money for the soup back onto my card, but he wouldn't do that. I
        ordered delivery so that I wouldn't have to go pick it up, obviously. I
        won't order from this place again. We were surprised at how bad this
        was. I just had the worst sushi in Westminster.....don't make the same
        mistake.

        i ended up coming here on a whim and was surprised with how much i love
        this place. the staff were super kind, the food looked and tasted
        amazing, and the inside was very clean. i’m from the coast so i can be a
        bit picky about sushi but this was delicious! also highly recommend
        their warm sake. 100% coming back here, and the prices aren’t bad
        either.

        Couldn't recommend. The rolls and nigiri are oddly proportioned and came
        out nearly frozen, and the quality of ingredients is pretty poor. To top
        it all off, none of the stuff was very flavorful at all, and I think
        prices are somewhat high for what you get.


        That being said, the service is so excellent! The owners(?) were very
        kind and clearly care a lot about the customer. There's just room to
        grow, flavor- and ingredient-wise.
