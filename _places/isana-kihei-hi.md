        OMG!!!! Best dinner on the island!  Wife and I enjoyed fresh mahi, lemon
        butter caper sauce (very light), perfectly done veggies (carrots and
        asparagus) and either edamame rice or mashed potatoes.  Don’t forget the
        mud pie!  Our server Crystal was super attentive and extremely pleasant,
        nice low noise level and for sushi fans, a nice sushi bar.  You can
        watch the sunset and relax!

        Our family enjoyed a lovely dinner at Isana this evening. The service
        was super-friendly and welcoming. We had a bit of trouble finding the
        restaurant due to road closures from the recent storm. The hostess
        helped us over the phone and was understanding why we were a little late
        for our dinner reservation.


        Seafood and sushi was fresh and prepared well. For starters, we had the
        miso butterfish, ahi rice cake, and hamachi collar. For entrees, we had
        the salmon avocado roll, hamachi avocado roll, spicy salmon roll, and
        slow roasted pork chow fun. The sushi rice had the proper chewy, firm
        texture, which in our family’s humble opinion can make or break the
        quality of a sushi place. Food was delicious and portions were a good
        size. Our server, Nikki, was attentive and friendly.


        Easy to book a reservation through Resy. This place would be a great
        spot for a date night, a family, or an even a big party for a birthday.
        Plenty of parking, too.


        NOTE: If Google Maps takes you to a parking lot of a condo complex, that
        is not the way to access the restaurant. From Piilani Hwy, take Okalani
        Drive and head toward the ocean. When you get to Kihei, turn left and
        head down for a few minutes. You’ll see the restaurant on the left hand
        side. The sign says Maui Beach Resort.

        The best food on the island. No matter what you order, it’s gonna be
        great. So no need to ask for suggestions from the stuff. I’ve tried
        almost every item there and it was amazing. Best sitting is at the bar
        (irony) as bartenders are great and you get your food almost instantly
        after placing the order.
