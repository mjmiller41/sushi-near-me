        Been wanting to try this place for awhile since it was recommended to
        me, but it is always packed in there. Finally I got to give it a shot,
        the restaurant is pretty compact with a modern ambiance. Service and
        food were great which I left super satisfied. Definitely will be back!

        Excellent Dragon Roll and tea just wished the tea had an option of sugar
        or honey.


        Wonderful customer service!


        Our waitress was fabulous!! She went above and beyond.


        The other sushi (either California Roll or Crunchy Roll) and the veggies
        in the tempura were just okay.  The shrimp tempura was so good though!

        Went here with my hubby since it was a beautiful day and we were
        suddenly craving for sushi. Tried this and loved it! The food was
        delicious and the service was very nice. Came in with hungry stomachs
        and left with very happy and full ones! Will definitely recommend and be
        back!

        Came here with my wife for dinner tonight (9/16/23) and the fish gave me
        food poisoning 🤮.


        Food tasted very average. Kitchen took a long time to prep the food and
        there was something wrong with the fish. We ordered the sashimi for 2,
        oysters, and 2 hand rolls. I’ve been sick in the bathroom for the entire
        evening since I came home from Live Sushi Bar (it’s now 1:30am as I
        write this review).


        The service was very good which is why I gave 2 stars. The servers were
        very attentive and friendly.


        I really wanted to like this place because it had good reviews. I won’t
        be coming back and I would not recommend this place unless you enjoy
        puking your guts out 🤢.

        Really enjoyed the chirashi and the omakase box special. Fish was very
        fresh and the omakase was very unique. We enjoyed all of it very much.
        The staff was nice despite an initial period of confusion about how long
        the wait was or whether we could even get a table. But once we were
        seated the staff were great. Atmosphere is cute. Looks somewhat updated,
        not a huge fan of loud music in any restaurant. So if you're looking for
        a quiet dinner out then you might want to go elsewhere, but the food
        alone is worth it. We were curious about the noodle soups, and I like to
        go back for that. Even though this is a sushi place, the soups that
        other people ordered looked promising.
