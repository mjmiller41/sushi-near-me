        moment I walked in, I felt like I was a special guest. The hostess and

        beautifully executed. I loved learning about the seafood in each dish
        and that a surprising amount comes from Tsukiji Fish Market in Japan. I
        could not sing enough praises for this experience. The atmosphere, the
        staff, and the food were beyond incredible and out-valued the cost of
        the experience tenfold. I will visit O-Ku every time I’m in Charolette.
        Thank you for a truly wonderful experience.

        I had the pleasure of having the omakase at O-Ku recently. From the
        moment I walked in, I felt like I was a special guest. The hostess and
        waitstaff (I believe my waitress’s name was Jasmine; I wish I had asked
        again) were beyond welcoming and wonderful. I had seven amazing courses
        over about 2.5 hours. Every dish was thoughtfully created and
        beautifully executed. I loved learning about the seafood in each dish
        and that a surprising amount comes from Tsukiji Fish Market in Japan. I
        could not sing enough praises for this experience. The atmosphere, the
        staff, and the food were beyond incredible and out-valued the cost of

        Thank you for a truly wonderful experience.

        I really, really wanted to like this place. The space and vibe seem cool
        when you enter. However, they had a lot of strikes on a not so busy
        Tuesday night. They said they could t move a reservation up :30 even
        though when we got there it was 1/2 empty. The drinks were pricey but
        good. The food ranged from bad to delicious. The special was a king crab
        hand roll and it was great. So was the Fuji roll. The South end shrimp
        and red dragon were good. The teriyaki chicken was mid and the truffle
        toro was terrible. The toro was tough and rubbery. I would have sent it
        back or complained but a) we waited over an hour, again on a not busy
        Tuesday night, for our food and b) our waitress disappeared for a while.
        5 people ate, 2 drinks and 1 appetizer was over $260 with tip. I won’t
        go back.

        The vibe was great for Valentine’s date night!

        The appetizers were pretty good, one note would be the duck buns didn’t
        have much flavor without the sauce.

        We were not a fan of the spider and red volcano roll as the tempura
        batter had a weird bitter taste, along with straying from crispy to rock
        hard 😅. The rainbow roll was delicious and will definitely stick with
        non-fried rolls here going forward (didn’t have this issue with the
        Raleigh location though).

        The Valentine’s pavlova was a miss for us as we were not a fan of the
        “crust” that made up most of the dessert, along with the jam tasting
        generically sweet (like one note but super sweet).

        Great sushi & service, the happy hour is pretty good. The price is $9
        for six different rolls. There was enough variety that the three of us
        were able to order something we would enjoy off of the happy hour menu.
        They have a good drink selection as well though we did not drink. Good
        for a date night or a ladies night out. The cost depends on how much
        sushi you eat - I love sushi so I eat more.

        We went for my wife's birthday and she got both a custom menu and a
        custom stemless wine glass. Cool touch.

        The food and service was good. Attentive service, full glass. Just know
        what you're ordering. Otherwise what kind of loud where we are at and
        cold by the windows.
