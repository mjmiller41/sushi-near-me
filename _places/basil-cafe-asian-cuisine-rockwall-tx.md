        This is my first time stopping by Basil Cafe. It was the beginning of a
        new year so I wanted to have something healthier, so I picked this place
        to go while errand running. I ended up ordering the Thai curry chicken
        with pork gyoza and side salad. The salad had a wonderful pureed onion
        vegetable dressing, the gyoza was seared on one side with a sweet soy
        sauce on the side. The Thai curry chicken bowl was the Superstar of the
        meal. It's very big so can certainly fill you up just on its own but I
        wanted to try their appetizer too. Lots of fresh vegetables in both the
        salad and the curry Thai chicken, I was delightfully surprised and
        happy, it exceeded my expectations as far as the sauce. The sauce has a
        light spice, is creamy and has that nice curry flavor to it. It's very
        rich and smooth with fresh vegetables and white meat chicken. The
        atmosphere is above average as far as romantic atmospheres go, with
        upgraded modern dark wood, dimmed lights and a nice cute little sushi
        bar. The seats were cushy and comfortable.  There are lots of options to
        choose from for both meat lovers and vegetarians. Overall it was super
        yums.

        Food is okay - it’s a vegan option just like any other Asian cuisine
        place but the service is even worse. The first couple of times I came
        here by myself and with my husband were great but when I brought my
        small children, we were ignored and had to flag down the server every
        time we needed something rather than waiting for her to come every few
        minutes. This was all while every other table with adults only were
        being waited on hand and foot. I decided then that I would only eat here
        if it’s takeout and I wasn’t impressed. 4/6 of my cucumber rolls were
        unrolled completely and falling apart by the time I got them and my
        house salad was 99% greens with literally one tomato and 1/30 of a
        cucumber slice. The fried rice was almost flavor-less. Rockwall already
        has such limited vegan options and it just sucks that this place doesn’t
        put that much care into their work. Please do better.

        This is an awesome place to enjoy Asian cuisine.  I love the atmosphere
        and the abundance of the dining experience.  My best friend and I
        enjoyed just all kinds of entrées. The menu is so beautifully displayed
        that it's like the food jumps out of the pages.  We had an awesome
        waitress!!!!They played great music, which accompanied the delicious
        food they served. Basil Cafe owes me nothing!!!!

        What a hidden gem!  We found this restaurant by chance and it is now one
        of our favorites. The food is delicious, always fresh and hot. Flavors
        are amazing and menu is very diverse. Service is top notch and the
        atmosphere is relaxed and subdued.  This has become a regular rotation
        at our house.
