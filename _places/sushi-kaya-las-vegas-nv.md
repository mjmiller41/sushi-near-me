        One of my all-time fave sushi all you can eat places in town. Has many
        great Staples and some inventive options too. The staff is great and
        keeps up with the crowd on most days, though like everywhere if it's
        busy things slow down amidweek. As locals, we love coming midday and
        midwwek amd recommend it for the best service speed and pricing.

        Great all you can eat. The sushi was tasteful.
        To many rolls are based on California rolls with pseudo crab meat.
        Only a couple of rolls are based on fish.

        Not the best, not the worst. I was hoping they would have sushi with no
        rice options, a few of my orders didn't come. Now I see why it says 15
        minutes wait time for some items, because it takes them 15 minutes to
        remember. For some reason, a few of my nigiri pieces were warm. Plus
        side, the Cajun albacore was good. Personally, I wouldn't come a second
        time, disappointing because I was hoping this place would be my second
        go to for sushi.

        Dinner AYCE for 2 not worth $80.

        I was there for the grand opening years ago . Was a great place for
        sushi.

        Now it's the worst sushi experience I've had . Gas station sushi would
        be better.


        First off, there  were more Flys than customers. One of the servers was
        using an electronic fly swatter near the table while we were eating.


        Every roll was 90% imitated crab with tiny pieces of fish.

        The rice was 3:1 ratio to fish .

        Two of the servers were more occupied on their phones than to deliver
        orders,  took almost 40 mins for an Alaska roll that was the first
        order.  All the rolls were soaked in sauce, probably to cover up the
        taste of old fish.

        The salmon skin salad was soaked in oil with no crisp.

        The pork belly was dry as jerky.

        Avoid this sushi if possible.

        Try some where cleaner and quicker on service like Smile Shota.
