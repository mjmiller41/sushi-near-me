        Popped in here by chance - delicious sushi, friendly staff, modern and
        yet welcoming interior! I was greeted warmly and when I asked, was
        recommended several types of nigiri! The fish was fresh and the
        ingredients full of flavor, and I loved the unique flavor combinations
        the owner has come up with! I came toward the end of lunch, and was the
        only one there.

        A small family owned hole in the wall gem of a sushi restaurant. I have
        been to many sushi places around the States and I will say this place is
        spot on when it comes to their sushi rolls. What's unique about this
        place is their daily - or weekly - specials (i.e. specialized sushi
        rolls that have limited ingredients or unique vs. the regular menu)
        constantly change and it is a first come, first serve basis until they
        run out. I've never seen that before and think that makes them truly
        standout.


        In terms of their sushi rolls, the quality, the selections, and taste
        was top-notch. They had a good selection of appetizers, which was also
        amazing, a good selection of sushi, Japanese craft beers, and Japanese
        sake for those that like to drink.


        I highly recommend checking this place out and recommend arriving a
        couple minutes early as the seating is very limited (25+/- seats). They
        do not take online reservations and when you arrive and the seats are
        all full, you will need to put your reservation on their sign up board
        inside.

        I cannot recommend this place highly enough to anyone looking for an
        authentic and unforgettable sushi dining experience. Every aspect of my
        visit exceeded any expectation — the service was appropriately attentive
        and everybody was friendly, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, and,
        the food itself... I have not stopped thinking about my food. I can’t
        wait to come back.

        I’m sorry I don’t know how this place has 4.7 rating, I do not recommend
        their rolls at all. Very limited menu, and on top of that you pay for
        ginger? I’m from Washington DC best places to eat sushi, and I compare
        this place to a grocery place that they serve sushi. Me and my husband
        went there tonight and we paid $147 with tip. We had two of their combos
        and two rolls and a one hot saki. With that price I could have an
        amazing dinner at sanctuary camelback resort.

        It was a super friendly place with great service. They put a really fun
        spin on sushi. Some of the sauces and flavors were so different! Like
        they had been aged for eons just to make it to the sushi they served.
        The fish was also exceptional
