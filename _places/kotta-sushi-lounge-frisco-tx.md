        The very best sushi I've ever tryed. Really nice taste and the
        presentation was amazing. The service was also excellent. All staff were
        so attentive and they help us to understand the menu and the questions
        we had about the dishes.

        Was in the mood for sushi and I have been here once before a few years
        ago. Went early and it was happy hour still so I got a few different
        rolls at good prices. The ingredients are very fresh and everything
        comes out quick. The service is wonderful and treats you well (I was the
        only one in at the time however). This is a fairly typical modern sushi
        bar. Nothing special moody lighting and a big sushi bar to sit at. It’s
        a surprise for Frisco, TX.

        Absolutely blown away by this gem of a sushi lounge! It strikes the
        perfect balance between upscale and welcoming — the kind of place where
        you can celebrate something special or just unwind after a long day. The
        quality of the fish is consistently outstanding — every bite tastes
        incredibly fresh and thoughtfully prepared. You can tell the chefs truly
        care about their craft. The ambiance is refined yet relaxed, and the
        service is impeccable without being overbearing. It’s rare to find a
        spot that nails every detail so effortlessly, but this place does it
        time and time again. A true neighborhood treasure with the soul of a
        fine dining experience.

        The food at Kotta Sushi Lounge was really good. Tried a variety of
        dishes. Avocado and Cucumber Rolls were nice and fresh.  Dayna Roll was
        a really creative roll. Never seen or had anything like it so it was
        nice to see a sushi restaurant that has a creative option for
        vegetarians (Most places  only have just a simple vegetable roll). 
        Garden noodles were very tasty and flavorful.  For dessert tried the
        chocolate mouse cake which was most and delicious and green tea ice
        cream which was nice and creamy.  In addition to the food, service and
        atmosphere was excellent.  Definitely will be back.

        Dined in for lunch and it was great!! Bento box and sushi’s were so
        tasty and fresh. Service was quick and attentive, my waters were always
        filled up and they prebussed all our dirty plates when possible. I do
        miss the oranges they used to serve with the bento boxes though. Highly
        recommend!
