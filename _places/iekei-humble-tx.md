        I came to Iekei Ramen & Sushi on a weekday evening. I was hungry while
        shopping at Walmart in Humble. The location is perfect. There are plenty
        of parking. The food was pretty good. I ordered Avocado Salad and Garlic
        Black Bean Ramen. I can tell the noodles are made fresh. The soup was
        delicious. I would definitely come back.

        Finally tried this place. Would definitely return. Family had spicy
        tonkotsu and regular tonkotsu ramen, beef upon, California roll and
        spider crab roll.

        Second visit was just as good as the first.

        I tried standard ramen, yellowtail sushi, and a cucumber roll with green
        tea.


        The fish was good, but only standard for a sushi restaurant.


        Cucumber roll was not brought to me, I was served a spicy cucumber. To
        me, it isn't what I wanted, and flavors were not balanced.


        Ramen was literally ramen house cheap packet ramen with garnishes. Stock
        was from a packet, noodle was from a packet, chashu pork sliced thin and
        fridge cold. Some garnishes were not typical, like cabbage and
        redonions; unexpected.


        I showed up at 6 in the evening, and the guy looked at his watch like:
        we were about to close.  The kitchen staff started throwing ruggs and
        washing out the kitchen with a hose.


        Lastly, and this is small for me, but I've never been treated this way
        in a Japanese ramen or sushi house. The staff was just off-putting and
        where not speaking Japanese or English.


        I wasn't served my tea. Wrong dish served to me. I was at the sushi bar,
        and sushi chef could not hear me to place an order for more food through
        his earbuds. The waiter was missing in action.


        I recommend  the owner revamp cause this could be a gold mine.

        Good service and good food. I could use more spicy but you can add more
        if you like. Pretty good selections on the menu.

        The beef udon was very flavorful; it could've been a bit more spicy. I
        asked for meduim spice.

        The Hama Chili was fresh & tasty - tangy, sweet & hint of spice- perfect
        balance.


        The mango cream brulee was not a true brulee; it also was runny & gave
        me pureed baby food vibes.

        The server was gracious and took the dessert off of my bill.


        Thank you. Overall, good food. I'd possibly visit again.
