        Slow service, nice waitress, but no music and not too many decorations.
        Better to take out sushi in the future! The price you pay to dine in for
        a party of two is $55 plus a tip. You can drive down the hill 25 minutes
        to Hemet and eat for $27 for two at “Pho Shack” which is delicious and
        affordable.

        I hope my review helps you decide and know it’s a long wait to dine in.
        You also feel ignored they should give free edamame or bread with oil &
        vinegar while you wait! Plenty of room for improvement but I don’t think
        the owner cares.

        Slow service, nice waitress, but no music and not too many decorations.
        Better to take out sushi in the future! The price you pay to dine in for
        a party of two is $55 plus a tip. You can drive down the hill 25 minutes
        to Hemet and eat for $27 for two at “Pho Shack” which is delicious and
        affordable.

        I hope my review helps you decide and know it’s a long wait to dine in.
        You also feel ignored they should give free edamame or bread with oil &
        vinegar while you wait! Plenty of room for improvement but I don’t think
        the owner cares.

        Great service and food. Rolls were fresh and tasty. I started with a hot
        green tea on a chilly afternoon. I got the calamari appetizer and the
        hot night roll. My favorites so far!

        GREAT SERVICE, BUT BLAND... it pains me to say this as the staff were
        absolutely wonderful. However, I have to be honest. I tried the edamame
        appetizers and they weren't a hit for me. Next, for the main course I
        had a order of veggie yakisoba w/ tofu and this also missed the mark big
        time. I didn't like that the noodles tasted store bought. Honestly I've
        had better maruchan noodles. The tofu was solid but it wasn't enough to
        save the dish. The fried fish looked good but I didn't get a chance to
        try it!


        I didn't feel like sushi this time around so I might give this place
        another shot, however it's going to be a while till I come back. As I'm
        writing this we are in the middle of the summer in Idyllwild and things
        are heating up. I was further disappointed that this place did NOT have
        AC, it was very steamy in there which made my visit a bit uncomfortable.
        Again, I'm sad that I have to leave this review because our waitress was
        awesome! Hoping they improve their cooking soon!

        This place was great!!! The servers were very quick if I needed anything
        (fork, extra water, etc). The food was pretty quick to come out, too. I
        got the seafood udon and it was amazing! The broth was not too fishy and
        the seafood didn’t have any shells which made it easy to eat. My mom got
        the beef teriyaki combo platter and it had the perfect portions! Not too
        much rice. The California roll was loaded with imitation crab. I live in
        San Diego which is a big city yet this was some of the best Japanese
        food I’ve had. I’ve been to Tokyo and I enjoyed this restaurant a lot.
        The owner guy is super nice too. Great way to start off my new year

        I was pleasantly surprised by how good the sushi was, especially
        considering it was located in the mountains! The quality and freshness
        exceeded my expectations. The owner was incredibly kind and made the
        experience even more enjoyable. The service was excellent—friendly and
        attentive throughout the meal. If you're looking for great sushi in an
        unexpected location, I highly recommend giving this place a try!
