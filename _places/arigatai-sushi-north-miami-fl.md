        Amazing Sushi and Great Service!


        I had a fantastic experience at Arigatai Sushi! The service was
        excellent—attentive but not intrusive, which made the meal even more
        enjoyable. The staff checks in at just the right moments without
        constantly hovering.


        The food was on another level—high quality, incredibly fresh, and
        beautifully presented. Everything tasted amazing, but I highly recommend
        the Tuna Cracker, the Volcano Roll, and the Bans—each one was packed
        with flavor!


        The restaurant itself is a bit small, but the design is stylish and
        comfortable. The ambiance is great, with music at a reasonable volume,
        allowing for easy conversation.


        A small downside was that the restrooms weren’t very clean, but overall,
        the experience was excellent. Prices are very reasonable, making it a
        great value for the quality you get.


        One important note: they don’t automatically add an 18% tip to the bill,
        so be sure to tip generously! Highly recommend this spot!

        Amazing Sushi and Great Service!


        I had a fantastic experience at Arigatai Sushi! The service was
        excellent—attentive but not intrusive, which made the meal even more
        enjoyable. The staff checks in at just the right moments without
        constantly hovering.


        The food was on another level—high quality, incredibly fresh, and
        beautifully presented. Everything tasted amazing, but I highly recommend
        the Tuna Cracker, the Volcano Roll, and the Bans—each one was packed
        with flavor!


        The restaurant itself is a bit small, but the design is stylish and
        comfortable. The ambiance is great, with music at a reasonable volume,
        allowing for easy conversation.


        A small downside was that the restrooms weren’t very clean, but overall,
        the experience was excellent. Prices are very reasonable, making it a
        great value for the quality you get.


        One important note: they don’t automatically add an 18% tip to the bill,
        so be sure to tip generously! Highly recommend this spot!

        Hello, The place is very cozy, and modern. We (4) all got our meals
        relatively quickly. One order being delayed slightly. Food is decent.
        Althought, I would expect a better experience considering the price. Our
        waitress went above and beyond. Asking us about our meals beforehand and
        confirming our order. Would recommend.

        Leila was wonderfully delightful! Excellent service, very attentive &
        professional.  The good was yummy!!!! The presentation was beautiful.
        The ambience was joyous. Pork belly boa buns were soooo good

        The rolls were delicious as well, the plantain on the plantain roll
        would be even better if the plantain were thicker/Cuban style

        Otherwise perfection

        They accommodated our preferences with ease and this made everything
        even better so good

        Can’t wait to come back

        Arigatai is my go-to sushi spot in the neighborhood. The food is
        consistently excellent, whether dining in or ordering takeout. The staff
        is warm and welcoming, and the owner is always present, ensuring
        everything runs smoothly with great attention to detail. My staples are
        the Sunset Roll, Crunchy Tuna, and Salmon & Tuna Delights—always fresh
        and flavorful. The buns and gyozas are just as delicious. Wishing them
        continued success!

        I had high hopes for this spot, but unfortunately, the food didn’t live
        up to expectations. The tuna tartare had a fishy odor and taste, which
        was a clear sign it wasn’t very fresh. On the bright side, the edamame
        was great, and the wakame special was pretty good, though it could’ve
        used more salmon pieces.


        The biggest disappointment was the sushi rolls. The truffle kani roll
        was advertised as 10 pieces but came with only 8. It lacked flavor, was
        dry, and completely fell apart when picked up. The crab salad inside was
        bland and didn’t add much to the roll. The Miami roll, supposedly a
        signature item, felt like a basic shrimp crunch roll—nothing special.
        Again, the crab salad on top was dry, had an odd taste, and didn’t work
        well with the roll.


        On a positive note, the service was good, and the staff was friendly,
        but unfortunately, that wasn’t enough to make up for the disappointing
        food. I try a new sushi spot every week, and this one just isn’t a place
        I’d return to.
