        I had my birthday dinner at this restaurant and it was a great
        experience.

        I got the Tamon Sashimi plate  and it was the perfect portion with very
        fresh fish.

        Everyone in my party enjoyed their meal thoroughly both fish and nonfish
        dishes were excellent.


        The staff were very friendly and accommodating with the birthday cake we
        had brought, providing us candles and sang me happy birthday.  I would
        come again.

        We came here for lunch on a Monday (Oct 9, 2023) as most of the
        highly-rated sushi spots are closed on Mondays in Little Tokyo. The
        dining room was empty except for one other table. This place is located
        inside a hotel on the second floor. The sushi is definitely fresh but
        the preparation style wasn’t a fit for us. The salmon sashimi and nigiri
        (and a few other types of fish) are presented with the chewy skin still
        on which leaves an undesirable texture. While it does look artsy (and
        allows the restaurant to serve fish parts that most others would trim
        away), it wasn’t palette friendly for us. We also tried the wagyu sushi
        which the server verified for us was Japanese A5 wagyu but it didn’t hit
        the mark. I’m not sure what was going on as it did not have the baseline
        umami that A5 has and tasted like American wagyu. Miso soup came with my
        entree and the soup was brought out after my entree was out for a bit.
        The staff was kind but seemed like a new crew. $100+ for a subpar LA
        sushi experience. There are much better places in LA.

        Tamon Sushi is an underrated gem, located on the second floor of the
        Miyako Hotel. Japanese hospitality with Japanese-speaking servers,
        serving authentic Washoku.


        I’ve stayed loyal to Tamon throughout the years, including when they
        downsized their menu to only sushi, and am glad that they are back in
        full force now.


        Definitely try their Fatty Fish nigiri set ($20), which features select
        chu-toro, yellowtail, and salmon at 2 pieces each, or their Senior Bento
        ($25) which features grilled fish, simmered veggies, mixed tempura, rice
        and miso soup.


        LOVE their happy hour, which features reduced sake, shochu, and beer
        options to pair with their fabulous food offerings. Happy hour runs from
        5:30-7:30pm, and simply rocks. Closed Sundays and Wednesdays.


        Excellent views over Historical 1st Street, calm ambiance with plenty of
        choices to suit any taste. This place consistently earns their 5 stars.

        Poor Customer Service

        We were the only table there for lunch on 2/16/25, we ordered chirashi
        box, Tamon bento box and senior bento, no soy sauce for sashimi, no
        tentsuyu for tempura, what kind of Japanese cusine is that?

        I asked for a cup of hot water, she gave me cold water.
