        I came to this location a couple times, and the quality of the food
        never disappoints. The sushi and sashimi (along with other dishes) are
        always fresh! The only concern I have is that sometimes the customer
        service is not the best. You either get a great server that is friendly,
        or one that doesn’t even talk to you. Overall, I would recommend this
        location for your sushi cravings!

        If it’s a craving for sushi - lots of it and all of it tasty - this is
        where we head to.

        There is some street parking nearby and once you get in they know what
        to do


        You look through the menu (if you want to) and order by marking on the
        page they give you and a short wait later - all that you ordered will
        appear.

        Fun is - you can ask for and fill these pages again and again- and the
        process will repeat!

        Until of course you are in a food coma and feel some genuine regret for
        the sin of gluttony

        Every single thing is lovely - and there are lots of choices to pick
        from- even the ice cream is great!

        We love going here esp when you’ve worked up an appetite

        I’m blown away at the quality of the fish here specially being at an all
        you can eat. It feels like a steal for the price that they charge.
        Service is quick, they don’t delay how fast your sushi comes out. I went
        with two other guys and we ate extremely fast and did not have to wait
        long between each set of sushi that we ordered. Would highly recommend.
        I will definitely be coming back.

        The sashimi was super fresh and simply divine! The rest was OK. We came
        late at 9pm Saturday night, and I would not do it again. They were
        rushing everyone who came around the same time. They close at 10:30!

        The sushi wasn’t anything to write home about, but it’s a good place to
        go for the $ value of all you can eat. They started wiping the floors
        and kitchen at 10pm and a very strong chemical smell filled the entire
        restaurant activating my severe asthma immediately! I couldn’t finish my
        food as I could hardly breathe thru gasping for air! I had to ask them
        to pack the sushi I had on the table, to which they wanted to charge me
        for! (Disappointing head shake)

        I could seriously barely talk/breathe till I left for fresh air outside!
        We are paying a heavy penny of $32usd/person for a proper dinner
        evening!

        At least WAIT till customers have finished their food and have left
        BEFORE you start washing floors with heavy chemicals!

        If this was just me, I might not say much. But another table of sweet
        elderly ladies (who’d come to kindly ask if I was OK) had also shared
        with us that they’d had an awful time with the waiters rushing them and
        quickly removing their dishes before they’d even finished.

        Not at all impressed to say the least.


        If you choose to go, go earlier than 9pm.

        The food was great. The portions were big. My husband and I ordered from
        "all you can eat menu" and it was enough for two of us. We were able to
        finish everything. We also got crab salad and it was nice. My favorite
        was "Snow Mountain Maki." The atmosphere is good, not noisy. The servers
        are nice. For dessert, I had green tea ice cream and it was delicious.
        You have to be super hungry to go there because that way you can try
        many different maki.
