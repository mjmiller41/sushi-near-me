        I was very skeptical about “all you can eat” as generally the quality of
        food is poor. NOT HERE AT Little Sakana! This is my second time here and
        everything that has been put on our table has been so delicious! My
        favorite is the Lotus Flower Roll!

        If you are reading this, it’s all you can eat on the menu…minus very
        little, in which you server will point out. Trying new things is the
        best place for it, so take a chance on something you might not order at
        other places, you will be pleasantly surprised as the food is so well
        prepared and delicious. The servers are prompt and great. Esther is our
        server both times we were here and she is so wonderful, and her
        colleagues are great as well. You generally will not be waiting long for
        your food, but understand this, word is getting out about Little Sakana
        and weekends can get really busy. Get on the waiting list and they will
        fit you in. It’s worth the wait.

        This little gem in Mira Mess is a must-try if you are looking for good
        Japanese food and sushi. During lunch, you can select the
        all-you-can-eat option for about $30 per person. You’ll enjoy an
        expansive menu featuring a variety of rolls, sashimi, and Japanese
        dishes. Everything is fresh, made to order, and highlights good
        ingredients. I’ve tried quite a few items on the menu and so far,
        they’ve never disappointed! It’s definitely worth the wait—so be sure to
        check in ahead of time because there’s often a line. This isn’t the best
        sushi I’ve ever had, but everyone I have taken here has been impressed
        by how good it is. 10/10 would recommend checking this place out!

        Hey there, sushi lovers! I recently hit up this all-you-can-eat sushi
        joint, and let me tell you—it was phenomenal! From the second I stepped
        through the door, I was buzzing with excitement, and this place did not
        disappoint.

        The Vibe

        The atmosphere? Electric! It’s got this vibrant, welcoming energy that
        just screams “fun night out.” The staff? Absolute rockstars—super
        friendly, always smiling, and totally on top of things. They kept the
        sushi flowing and made sure we had everything we needed without ever
        making it feel rushed. It’s like they were as pumped as I was to be
        there!

        The Sushi

        Now, the main event—the sushi! Oh man, where do I start? The variety was
        unreal. They had all the classics—think California rolls and spicy
        tuna—but then they kicked it up a notch with some wild specialty rolls
        that were pure genius. Every piece was a little work of art, plated up
        so beautifully I almost felt bad eating it (almost). The fish? Crazy
        fresh. The flavors? BAM, right on point. There was this one roll—tempura
        shrimp, creamy avocado, and this zesty sauce drizzled on top—that had me
        going back for seconds (and thirds). And since it’s all-you-can-eat, I
        didn’t have to hold back—I sampled everything, guilt-free!

        The Experience

        The service was fast but chill, striking that perfect balance where
        you’re never waiting too long, but you’ve got time to savor every bite.
        The chefs were killing it behind the counter, clearly loving what they
        do, and it showed in every roll. Oh, and those little extras—like warm
        towels to start and endless green tea—made it feel extra special.

        The Verdict

        I rolled out of there stuffed to the brim and grinning ear to ear. This
        place is a sushi paradise with a killer vibe, and I’m already counting
        down the days until I can go back. If you’re craving a sushi feast
        that’s fresh, fun, and totally worth it, this is your spot! Trust me,
        you’ll leave happy—and maybe a little too full, but in the best way
        possible. Can’t wait for round two!

        Amazing sashimi and great rolls. Always busy too. Great area and for
        sure worth the price. I highly recommend if you are a huge sushi eater.
        If you just feel like a roll or two for your sushi fix then not as worth
        it. Sashimi add on is definitely worth it too if you love it. Hand rolls
        are also good too. The  VIP roll was my favorite by a long shot for
        rolls. Nice acidity and balance to the avocado with thin slices of lemon
        that helped create a nice bite and balance. Highly Recommend for any
        sushi lovers with an appetite.

        San Diego, a city renowned for its sun-soaked beaches and laid-back
        charm, holds culinary treasures that often escape the casual eye.
        Nestled unassumingly in a bustling neighborhood, Little Sakana All You
        Can Eat emerges as a beacon for sushi aficionados and newcomers alike—a
        hidden gem waiting to be discovered.


        Upon entering, you’re immediately embraced by an atmosphere that pulses
        with energy yet feels remarkably intimate. The modern decor blends
        seamlessly with traditional touches, but it’s the music that sets the
        tone. An eclectic mix of tunes fills the space, crafting a vibe that’s
        both invigorating and comfortably familiar. It’s more than background
        noise; it’s the heartbeat of the restaurant, syncing with the clatter of
        chopsticks and the murmur of satisfied diners.


        The service is nothing short of exceptional. Staff members greet you
        with genuine smiles, their attentiveness striking the perfect balance
        between professional and personable. They’re quick to guide you through
        the extensive menu, offering insights that reflect both expertise and a
        true passion for the cuisine.


        And then there’s the sushi. Each piece is a testament to freshness, a
        harmonious blend of flavor and texture that speaks volumes of the chefs’
        dedication to their craft. The salmon is buttery and rich, the tuna
        vibrant and clean, and the rolls—artful creations that both honor
        tradition and embrace innovation. The all-you-can-eat format, often a
        harbinger of mediocrity, here becomes an invitation to explore without
        restraint, knowing that each bite will be as delightful as the last.


        One can’t help but notice how Little Sakana encapsulates the essence of
        San Diego itself. It’s a place where diverse influences come together to
        create something uniquely satisfying. The restaurant doesn’t just serve
        food; it paints a picture of the city—its warmth, its dynamism, its
        unpretentious excellence.


        As my first culinary foray in San Diego, Little Sakana sets the bar
        remarkably high. It’s rare to find a place that so effortlessly combines
        outstanding food, impeccable service, and an ambiance that feels both
        exciting and welcoming. This is more than a meal; it’s an experience, a
        celebration of what makes dining out one of life’s great pleasures.


        In a city brimming with dining options, Little Sakana All You Can Eat
        doesn’t just stand out—it shines. Whether you’re a local seeking a new
        favorite spot or a traveler eager to taste the flavors of San Diego,
        this restaurant is a must-try. It’s a reminder that the best discoveries
        often lie just off the beaten path, waiting for those who take the time
        to look.
