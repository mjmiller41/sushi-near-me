        First time experience was great! I opted for a sushi roll SA Cowboy,
        steak was rare 😋. Old fashion was nice and smokey. Tried a few plates
        from the conveyor belt. Overall nice experience and good food.

        What happened since December? That was the first time we dined and today
        Valentine’s Day is the last time. Brian was our server in December and I
        honestly can’t remember if our server told us her name today. We were
        seated by 11:35am today, the restaurant opened at 11:30am. This is
        important later. We were seated promptly. You would think by 11:45 the
        rotating sushi would be ready to go but it wasn’t. It wasn’t even full
        by the time we left at 12:40pm. My side of rice was hard, my spicy tuna
        roll was dry and not spicy. I really wanted to have a nice time but all
        these issues literally ruined my Valentine’s Day with my husband. The
        final straw was when we were given our total which initially was $51 but
        our server came back and told us that there was an automatic 20%
        gratuity today so I asked why we weren’t told by the hostess. I planned
        to tipmore but that automatic was very off putting. She told me the sign
        was posted at the door and I assured her that when we were walking in it
        was not. Check time stamps on the cameras but the manager had not posted
        it till later. We reluctantly paid but the more I thought about it the
        more mad I got and feel sick to my stomach.

        This place was super cool! Looked up top sushi places in San Antonio and
        this one popped up. The revolving belt was the coolest! The food off of
        there was really good. We also ordered hibachi which was tasty. Friendly
        staff and cool atmosphere.

        This place is ideal if you're seeking affordable sushi but are undecided
        about what to eat. In my opinion, the service is impeccable, and the
        food is excellent. However, some dishes require a specific taste. It's
        great for date night or a group lunch/dinner.
