        Everything is good here. The food is delicious, the staff are happy,
        pleasant, and so eager to make sure everyone has a good meal. The all
        you can eat menu is diverse and reasonably priced. They have a party
        room in the back and we had a great time celebrating my spouse’s
        birthday there. We have been to Sakana many times and every first timer
        we have taken there ends up loving it.


        Many thanks to all of the Sakana staff - you’re blowing it out of the
        park!

        Dinner was amazing!!! Looking for a new spot to eat and Sakana popped up
        and was 5 min from house. As soon as we walked in the door, service and
        atmosphere was inviting and friendly. Placed was packed and still
        servers were at your table in 2 mens with water and plates. We went for
        a lot of sushi rolls and some soup. The wonton soup was net level, fresh
        made wontons, you can tell by size and texture. Totally different was
        regular asain spots. The various sushi rolls 🍣  got were also spot on.
        Rice texture and taste was amazing. My daughters were definitely
        enjoying. My youngest grabbed some lo mein noodles 🍜 which she devoted.
        My wife's favorite roll was the dragon 🐉 roll. Definitely will be
        eating here more often. They also have an All You Can Eat option which I
        will try with just my wife and I 😀

        It serves fresh, authentic and delicious food. I chose to dine in and
        get the all you can eat. They give you a menu that you can pick from for
        the all you can eat. You are allowed to order seconds as long as you eat
        all the food that you order. They also have a regular menu you can order
        from. I ordered sushi and some traditional Asian platters. It was all
        delicious.

        Everything was so good for us! Amazing sushi and service! We especially
        love the Yuzu Salmon and White Tuna Truffle. Tom Yum Soup was phenomenal
        for this cold weather too.

        This was my first time here. I chose the all you can eat option. I must
        tell you that this food is as good as any Chinese/Asian/sushi restaurant
        that I've ever had. It is a little on the pricey side but compared to a
        buffet the food quality is very high.. I will come back often.  Please
        notice the photo of all of the empty dishes.
