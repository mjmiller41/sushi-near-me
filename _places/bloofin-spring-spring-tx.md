        We came for a date night on a Saturday & we sat at the bar. Cynthia gave
        us excellent service, start to finish. The food was fresh & so
        delicious. Everything we had was superb but one of our favorite items
        tonight was the Hama Chili appetizer. INCREDIBLE!!! We will definitely
        be back.

        Overall I enjoyed our first experience there. The Monkey brains seem to
        be popular. For me they were good, but not something I'd always order. 
        I had the Spicy Miso Soup and that broth was great! That one was
        definitely a re-order type of flavor. The server was very friendly and
        had a genuine feel to him.  Atmosphere overall was professional and I
        love the flower woodwork above.

        Decent service and good atmosphere. Ordered the wagyu skewers as starter
        and they weren't great. Very chewy and overcooked so that was
        disappointing especially based on price. Spicy edamame was ok but
        definitely not spicy as seems they just add some seasoning but no oil to
        mis it around. Steak fried rice was good but would say the sushi was
        just average despite decent sized rolls. The Yami roll had so much cream
        cheese that's all you could taste while the crazy one just lacked flavor
        so disappointing.  The roll selection is a bit limited as well with not
        a lot of variety.
