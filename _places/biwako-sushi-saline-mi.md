        This place is popping! Fast and friendly service with fast turnaround on
        Sushi order time. They have deep fried sushi! Highly recommend.
        Restrooms are clean. Space seems small, but with the service as fast as
        it is, tables had a fast turnover.

        We got takeout here twice, and it was great both times. Fish was really
        fresh, rice was perfectly cooked and flavorful. The menu is huge! Almost
        too huge. It was hard to decide because there were so many options. Will
        definitely be back!

        Authentic clean adventures sushi! Biwako sushi nestled in a strip mall
        in Saline Michigan this restaurant includes a sushi bar which is full of
        fun and delicious eats.  I love to play on rolls names they have names
        that connect you with MI roots like Spartan & Ann Arbor and the
        wolverine . They have many “safe” traditional sushi rolls, yet their
        specialties are adventurous to the taste buds. I also ate the seaweed
        salad and miso soup, but those were done before I could take pictures.
        This has become a routine Friday night sushi spot. Small intimate
        setting with loads of traditional Japanese touches. GO!

        Addendum to previous review!

        Since finding this spot I brought many colleagues and friends and family
        here. But! After today I will no longer be going back and neither will
        my family!

        My daughter brought me for early mother's day lunch, And after finding 2
        hairs in her sushi, the waitress fluffed it off As that's the way
        tempura looks. Thank goodness for another blonde haired.Gal, that was
        listening and did the right thing.And had our sushi remade . Needless to
        say my daughter lost her appetite,

        Due to the food and the attitudes other than the blonde.

        When we got the bill, I politely asked "no discount for hair in the
        food?" And the person who claimed to be a manager yelled at me and said
        we remade it for you so no!

        I calmly replied that that was not the way for her to handle things.I
        come there all the time.And I would like to continue to come back and I
        asked again if she was a manager and she said not really.I'm the lead. I
        proceeded to tell her, her attitude was not how you handle customers,
        Especially if you are a small establishment as she proclaimed you want
        your customers coming back. Due to the attitudes, the hair and their
        poor judgment , I will find a new restaurant! Sad thing is my employees
        , my family and friends will no longer come either once they hear how we
        were treated.


        This was my first visit to Biwako and definitely will not be my last. 
        Rolls were large, delicious and the bill was very reasonable!

        I recommend highly.
