        Very delicious, well priced, and cozy atmosphere. Left feeling happy and
        full, and the service was great. The crispy rice was amazing, as were
        the other rolls!

        Came here for lunch from seeing good reviews on here, but I ended up
        disappointed. It's not bad, but it's not great either.


        I ordered a salmon don, the salmon was alright, but the rice was dry and
        hard. It took a second to get seated, one of the waitresses was just on
        her phone while we waited to be seated (there were several open tables.)
        The waitress we did end up getting was really attentive though, and she
        frequently came to refill our water, take away plates, etc.


        I think for the price it's fair, but I don't think I'm coming back here.

        Charming, 25 seat restaurant with budget midweek lunches. We ordered 2
        bento boxes and a sashimi& sushi lunch special to share. The miso soup
        was good. The salad was chilled and tasted really fresh. The sashimi was
        chilled, fresh & tender. The large sushi pieces (with less rice which is
        the way I like) was not dressed with wasabi - at least for the salmon
        pieces. The sizeable salmon teriyaki had a nice grill flavor with a less
        sweet teriyaki sauce. The tonkatsu was a thin pork cutlet with a deep
        fried crispy coating and was served with a tangy side of sauce. The
        service was attentive and water was filled up regularly. On a cold
        Thursday in December (2024), there was a short line for the few tables.

        I ordered rice with beef, it was good but had too much onion in it, the
        soup was good, perfect for the cold weather, sushi were just ok, nothing
        special. Waiters were nice, would rate rate the place 3-4/5
