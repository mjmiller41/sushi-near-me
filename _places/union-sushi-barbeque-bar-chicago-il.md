        The first time and last time we were here was over a decade ago when
        this joint first opened up.  It was one of the first Japanese robata
        grill joints in Chicago downtown and I remember our experience was good,
        nice ambient and sushi selections.  I remember that I didn't care for
        the ramen and there was really nothing memorable.

        We decided to give it another try after all of these years, just to
        confrim the reasons why we haven't been back.

        The ambient is ok, much brighter then before, weird layout with tables
        and seats wrapping along the walls and that big pillar in the middle. 
        The Saturday we were there, it was about 60% capacity, wasn't busy.

        The menu changed drastically, it used to be much bigger with higher end
        offerings, wine / sake paring and such, now it is just like a
        neighborhood sushi joint (I think that is what they going for now), the
        sushi was good, but for some reason, they were really wet, drenched in
        sauce (luckily they were light) and infused oil.  Fresh fish.  They took
        the ramen off the menu which was a bummer because that is the typical
        order at the end of the Japanese meal.  The robata was OK. The skirt
        steak order has a good amount of it, very tender but it is missing the
        grilled flavor.  The chicken thighs were a bit over cooked, dry.   They
        only had 3 beers left on the menu.

        The service was OK but the food came quite late considering their
        capacity that night.   The robata came up first and we had to wait for
        the sushi, and we didn't get our last orders of sushi even after we
        finished eating everything else, so we had to cancel the last orders and
        leave.

        Again, nothing special and nothing memorable, the menu is too limited. 
        It went from a high end date night joint to a screaming baby,
        bachelorette party neighbor joint.  It is unfortunate.

        A huge selection, great atmosphere and attentive staff. Some of the
        best, perfectly made items I've had for a long time. The pork rib was
        totally amazing.  It's great to take people who aren't into sushi (er
        huh) so they have something great too. Can't say how awesome the staff
        was. Wasn't too busy, so hopefully they keep it up during busy times.
        Definitely worth a stop!

        The yam mash on guacamole was extremely good. All the Japanese barbecue
        was amazing! Pricing for 4, we ate a lot of sushi, was $258!

        Try it out and you'll be pleased.
