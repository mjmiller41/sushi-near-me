        love Wasabi!!! been going there since I was a teenager, Gary and his
        wife are the friendliest restaurant owners I've ever met, they always
        remember customers by name and have great relationships with their
        surrounding communities. The food has always been delicious and their
        hibachi chefs are always respectful of my friends vegetarian food making
        sure it's cooked before any meat which is always a big thing for us.
        Besides that the hibachi chefs always put on a nice little performance
        while making the food that's always enjoyable as they're always
        friendly/interact with the patrons.

        Can't say enough good things about this place!

        I’m a hibachi fanatic and make it a point to visit a hibachi restaurant
        in every state I travel to, but nothing has ever topped Wasabi. I’ve
        been coming here since I was 17, if not longer, and they nail it every
        single time. I don’t eat any meat besides chicken, but their hibachi
        chicken is unbeatable—it’s a craving I can never shake. Pair it with
        their fried rice and extra yummy sauce, and you’ve got perfection. On
        top of the incredible food, the staff is amazing and so personable;
        every visit feels like coming home to family. Run, don’t walk, to this
        place—they’re the best!

        I visited this place over the weekend for the first time. The sushi was
        great and the teriyaki was also good. We will be back to visit again.
        Side note- the women's bathroom is how a public bathroom should be done.
        Great job!

        So I wanna start off by saying how much I love Wasabi Japanese
        Steakhouse.. we spend a lot of money There are very regular. Dine in and
        out.  . We spend hundreds of dollars a month eating here ..


        We went there for Valentine’s Day dinner , we had to wait about 10
        minutes for a seat , which was expected because I know it was a holiday
        and We did not have a reservation ; that was fine.


        Our problem begins with being seated, for over *30 minutes the waiter
        passed us multiple times and did not even acknowledge us. . .*  I had to
        flag him down and tell him we’ve been sitting here for over a half an
        hour and have not even been asked for a drink order yet. He was annoyed
        and abruptly took the drink order. For some reason he was the only
        waiter on the entire dine inside, which was absolutely despicable.

        He came back with the drinks a few minutes later and we ordered food. I
        asked for halved mushrooms and he told me while laughing he is not the
        cook.. I ordered this every time weve gone, and I’ve never been treated
        like an idiot the way this guy treated me


        When The food finally came out (about 45 min later) every single item
        was ice cold like It had just came out of a refrigerator.  . Tim went up
        and alerted the owner and was scoffed at and given the back of his
        head..

        so we left .. almost 2 hours and we now had to go get Valentine’s Day
        dinner at 830 at night elsewherere which totally ruined our evening
        plans . .


        We went to Zona , and were in and out in 30 minutes even as busy as they
        were , served hot food and waited on appropriately.


        I am absolutely appalled at the behavior of the owner , lack of
        preparation and overall experience. Multiple couples who were sitting
        around us also heavily annoyed with the same lack of service had the
        same exact issue. So it was NOT just us. .


        You would think for such a busy holiday they would have had multiple
        waiters on staff or perhaps closed their Uber orders because there were
        dozens of those people standing there waiting to pick up also ..


        100% beyond infuriated with this experience and to top it off, i
        messaged their Facebook to describe all of this TWICE and was ignored 
        even though they’re register posting and have since posed there and the
        messages Were read . they clearly do not care about their customers.
