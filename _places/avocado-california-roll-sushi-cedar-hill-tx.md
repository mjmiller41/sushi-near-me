        I'd say that the rolls are good. Alot of the rolls are basically like
        California rolls with different toppings. They tasted real good but for
        someone that loves sushi like me, you may appreciate a different
        approach. All of the seats have seat cushions. The inside is comfortable
        and themed beautifully. I will be back for sure.

        Great place even though it's right next to the shopping center. We came
        in and no one wanted to wait on us. It was our first time and non of the
        ladies there was like let me help. We went to the front grabbed a menu
        and looked. Then went to a table and then the waitress finally asked us
        togo or for here. She was nice after she took our order and apologized
        for not greeting us. The food was great we got the $30 special, 2 rolls
        valued at $14 each and 2 appetizers and 2 miso soups 🍲 . Everything was
        great and we enjoyed it. Will go back if we are ever by.

        Update 12/14/24- this place has changed names. It's now moon and ramen
        or something like that. The tea my mom asked for was from kroger, and
        the water was room temp. We were told that there were whole wings, but
        they ended up being 3 flats for $5.95. When we questioned it, the server
        told us the cook said he ran out of whole wings, so he made those.
        Shrimp fried rice tastes like it was cooked in a burnt skillet. Sadly,
        my go-to chill spot is no more. I probably won't be back.


        If you want to chill/relax, this is your place. Great miso soup, chicken
        egg rolls and sushi!  I got the Cedar Hill roll.
