        Thought the Massey deal was really good for dinner around $68 for 15
        courses. The chef was fast and kind, the sushi was quality and tasted
        really good. Really enjoyed this experience. Thought aesthetically it
        was a bit dark, we ended up being downstairs, but overall thought it was
        a good experience. Left feeling satisfied, but not overtly stuffed.

        courses. The chef was fast and kind, the sushi was quality and tasted
        really good. Really enjoyed this experience. Thought aesthetically it
        was a bit dark, we ended up being downstairs, but overall thought it was
        a good experience. Left feeling satisfied, but not overtly stuffed.

        Unfortunately, it looks better than it tastes! Please do not come here
        for the omakase!! Fish was placed on PIPING hot rice and the rice was
        not seasoned. Zero flavor!! Fish tasted so warm and unappetizing.


        Our sushi chef torched every single piece of fish. Even the Toro was
        torched until it was fully cooked. I had never had Toro cooked well done
        and it lacked all the flavor you look for in Toro. We actually had to
        ask the server why every single piece was torched and their response was
        that it just depends on the chef.


        There are so many other affordable omakase options in nyc.

        The fish tastes warm and the meat is hard to swallow. The waiting time
        between course is long and no introduction with the dishes. But it’s $50
        per person. So if u wanted to eat something special with little money.

        My boyfriend and I had an amazing date night at Shiso Omakase! For just
        $85, we enjoyed an 18-course omakase crafted by Chef Billy.


        - Miso soup

        - Bluefin tuna with truffle and uni dressing

        - Mackerel with sesame dressing and lime zest

        - Yellowtail with fresh wasabi

        - Japanese Golden eye snapper with kombu

        - Aburi salmon

        - Kampachi with miso paste and ginger

        - Spanish mackerel with yuzu, pepper, and lemon

        - Japanese sea bream with lime zest

        - Hokkaido scallop with ikura and lime zest

        - Squid with masago

        - Amaebi with crunchy garlic sauce

        - Otoro with uni

        - Unagi

        - Ikura with lime zest

        - Hokkaido uni

        - Toro hand roll

        - Panna cotta ( make sure to give it a good mix! )


        The fish, flown in from Japan, was incredibly fresh, and each nigiri
        piece was perfectly seasoned and delicious. Our favorites were the
        bluefin tuna with truffle, the unagi, and the uni. The intimate ambiance
        made it even more special.

        AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Food sucked. Dessert sucked. Service sucked.
        Atmosphere sucked. Waiters attitudes sucked. Not an authentic omakase by
        any means. This place has to be not just the worst omakase/sushi place
        I’ve been to, it is quite possibly the worst restaurant I’ve been to. We
        got there at 7:40 pm, we had a 7:45p omakase bar reservation and they
        told us the bar was full. It was a 45 minute wait for the bar. 1st
        strike. We sit at a table because we’re hungry and wait 30 minutes for
        the miso which was cold! We then waited an additional 25 minutes to get
        our platter of nigiri. Not one piece of fish was fresh, they were all
        chewy, fishy, dry or inedible. The truffle on top tasted like it sat on
        a shelf for 4 years. The staff were all Americans. Not your typical
        omakase Japanese staff. 26 years and under. Nasty attitudes even though
        they didn’t honor our reservation. They didn’t know what each piece of
        fish was, and when we asked about ikura and uni they said they didn’t
        know. They didn’t even have it but they didn’t tell us that.


        We paid $65 for the premium menu of 18 pieces and not one bite was
        enjoyable. I wanted to spit out the fish multiple times. The ginger also
        tasted old. We had to beg the sushi chef for sushi ginger. We got there
        at 7:45 and didn’t eat until 8:45pm. Also the AC was on blast at 63
        degrees!


        There was another woman that got there before us and waited for the bar.
        She had to curse out the staff and left after waiting over 1.5 hrs for
        her food which she never got.


        For $70 go to your local sushi place because I guarantee the fish is
        fresher than here and actually edible.
