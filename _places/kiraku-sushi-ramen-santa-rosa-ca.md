        The sushi here is okay, the sashimi is fresh, the restaurant has a
        diverse menu with many dishes. The ramen here is normal, but because I
        wanted to eat noodles, I tried it. When you come here, you should order
        sushi because it is the restaurant's strength.


        The staff is friendly, the service is good even though the restaurant is
        very crowded, there are even robot waiters, the restaurant will have a
        food delivery system by conveyor belt, whatever dish you order, the
        conveyor belt will transport the dish to that table area.

        We went in not knowing how fun this place would be. My partner had some
        really great rolls and I had veggie tempura and ramen with chicken. All
        the food was high quality and came out streaming hot! The race car that
        brought the rolls was so cute! We enjoyed all the decor too. The staff
        were friendly and the hostess robot was really sweet.

        Just had a lunch with 12 of us for my stepdaughters birthday. What an
        amazing place and atmosphere. The food was fresh and delicious. They
        have my daughter gifts and and I mean a few. Hands down best restaurant
        I've ever eaten at. Hands down one of the best sushi spots I've been
        too. Definitely going back.

        Really cute, little restaurant, tried it yesterday with friends. It’s
        pretty small, but we also noticed they had a whole section of single
        serve spots for people dining alone. Which I thought was nice. You order
        from an iPad, and that sends the orders back to the kitchen. Ramen will
        be delivered by somebody to your table if you order it, and sushi and
        other small plates arrive via the little race car system which was super
        cute. The prices were shockingly reasonable. I paid like $15.95 for my
        bowl of ramen. I don’t know any places to get a decent bowl of Ramen for
        that price. The quality was good, the broth tasted great. My friends
        ordered some sushi and were happy with it as well. It was the first
        reasonably priced meal. I think we’ve eaten a long time. I’d come back
        when in the area again for sure.
