        Food was ok.  don’t think it’s necessary to serve both noodles and rice.
        A lot of food waste (too much for most people to eat).  Also, they put
        way too much of a syrupy (soy sauce?) on everything.  It unfortunately
        took away from the quality of the food.  It was still good, but a few
        small changes could make better.  And I was disappointed that they
        didn’t serve tea with dinner.  But the atmosphere was good and the
        service was good as well.

        This is our favorite hibachi in the area- large portions, a good show,
        delicious food. Their hibachi meal includes soup, salad, rice, noodles,
        veggies, (your choice of meat), a few shrimp, and ice cream. There's at
        least 1 portion of leftovers to be packed up. We had a birthday, and
        they gave us a small inflatable hat, and decorated the birthday guy's
        ice cream.


        Service is fast, but they're always busy. Reservations HIGHLY
        recommended on weekends, if you want to guarantee a seat.

        The place was packed! Pick-up orders waiting at the front, a wait to get
        in for dinner for both tables and Hibachi. I would call in advance for
        sure! It was totally worth going. the food was amazing. Recommended the
        bento dinner boxes! Great price you get soup, salad,  sushi roll,
        veggies, a meat and an appetizer with a side of rice. The waiter was
        almost reading my mind, water was filled without it getting too low, he
        checked on us and helped answer questions about the different noodles
        and options when he saw we were struggling with what to pick! The
        atmosphere was great, art work is beautiful and the place was clean.
        Will Totally be coming back and ordering more often!!
