        door was hard to find at night, but once inside. What a Great, small yet
        full of life restaurant! The service was excellent, and the food served

        I can't say enough good things about Umigawa. From the moment I walked
        in, everything was top-notch—but the real standout was the quality of
        the fish. Every piece was incredibly fresh, buttery, and full of flavor.
        You can really taste the difference when the fish is this high-quality.


        The presentation was beautiful, the service was attentive without being
        overbearing, and the overall vibe of the restaurant was calm and
        inviting. It’s clear the chefs here are passionate about their craft.
        Whether you're a sushi enthusiast or just looking for an unforgettable
        meal, Umigawa is the place to go. I’ll definitely be back!

        I think the business may benefit from expanding their menu to include
        some Dons and more rolls options, as Japanese restaurants here commonly
        have. Because of the very limited menu, it was difficult to find items I
        was interested in having. The quality was not bad but not great either -
        very mediocre. It was surprising that the server did not know the kinds
        of fish on the set sushi platter and had to check with the chef. Also,
        serving 2 salmon nigiri and 2 tuna nigiri in a 10-piece sushi platter
        feels cheap and low-effort. The environment was nice and it feels like
        they’re trying to create a high-end dining experience. However, my
        experience was just very mediocre so I will not be returning.

        My wife and I enjoyed a lovely dinner here tonight. All the fish was
        very fresh and the service was awesome. The manager seems like he is
        running a very tight ship and is passionate about the food and dining
        experience. Cannot wait to come back!

        The seaweed salad was well done and not out of Costco box like many of
        other restaurants. The tempura was amazing. The sushi was good. Only
        thing was that seems they were short of staff so things are a bit slow.
