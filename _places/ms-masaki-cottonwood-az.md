        Overall, it was good and we'll visit again since it's right here in
        Cottonwood. Our server and the chef were friendly and the owner came out
        to see if we were enjoying our meal.The Mountain Crunch roll was
        delicious and the yellowtail sashimi was good and nicely presented. The
        scallops were lost in the scallop roll so I'd order scallop sashimi next
        time. The large sake at $8 was fair, but $5 for a bowl of miso soup
        seemed high. You can opt to sit at the sushi bar, a table, or a booth
        which is nice. The country/classic rock playlist was out of place. Happy
        hour is 2-5.

        I’ve never had any complaints on the food I’ve ordered, especially since
        sushi options are minimal in cottonwood (unless you like grocery store
        sushi). The service is always great too.


        I do have a couple of complaints. One being that this place will close
        randomly and very often. We tried to go in on a Wednesday but they were
        closed for a private party and said they aren’t usually open Wednesdays
        so I think the Google info needs adjusted. Aside from that, we can show
        up when they are said to be open and they have a sign on the door saying
        they are closed. It’s happened about 9 times.


        Second, there aren’t many options for children and the stuff they do
        have is pretty gross. Not many veggies and the food is usually soggy.


        Then third, sometimes the place is really hot which can be uncomfortable
        considering the place is so small.

        Super delicious food, incredible service, and the chefs care. I notified
        the server that I had an onion allergy and to leave off onions from my
        entree and roll. She alerted me that the chef noted there was onion
        powder in the teriyaki sauce. Which went a long ways with me. I'll
        definitely be back!!
