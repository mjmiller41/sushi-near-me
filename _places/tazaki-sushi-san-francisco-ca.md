        I stopped here for dinner with a friend and had some ridiculously
        delicious sushi. The fish was wonderful and the texture of the sushi was
        perfect.

        The restaurant itself is family-run with attentive staff, and we never
        felt out of place or ignored. Everyone was super friendly and kind, and
        it seemed like a popular neighborhood spot as they often ran out of
        seats! There was even a cute little room in the back for large parties
        that looked like its own house with the decor.

        Overall I definitely recommend stopping by- I’m sad to just visit and
        wish I had a spot like this in my hometown!

        I stopped here for dinner with a friend and had some ridiculously
        delicious sushi. The fish was wonderful and the texture of the sushi was
        perfect.

        The restaurant itself is family-run with attentive staff, and we never
        felt out of place or ignored. Everyone was super friendly and kind, and
        it seemed like a popular neighborhood spot as they often ran out of
        seats! There was even a cute little room in the back for large parties
        that looked like its own house with the decor.

        Overall I definitely recommend stopping by- I’m sad to just visit and
        wish I had a spot like this in my hometown!

        My favorite sushi restaurant in the Outer Sunset!!! It’s the only
        restaurant I’ve found in the City that puts scallops in their 49er Roll.
        It’s so buttery and fresh - my favorite roll! We’ve also enjoyed the
        Eclipse (quail egg is heaven), Uni, salmon sashimi, Cal Roll and Crazy
        Rolls. Tazaki is the sushi chef and shops for fresh fish Daily. The
        service is always quick and friendly. Highly recommend!

        Wow, unbelievably generous portions. It's 2pm the next day and I'm still
        full from last night's dinner here.


        I ordered the Tazaki Sushi Combo - real crab California roll and 6
        pieces of nigiri, chef's choice. It also came with miso soup, salad, and
        ice cream (chocolate or green tea). There was also complimentary
        edamame, which was sweet and savory and softer than al dente - I really
        enjoyed it.


        I could've shared this meal with another human of average appetite. I
        was already full after the California roll - look at how much crab meat
        is in there! But I took my time and ate the sashimi sans rice. Their
        rice is too wet and could use a little more flavor - that's the only
        reason I couldn't give them 5 stars for the food. Otherwise, the fish
        was fresh and bountiful!


        I'd "see you tomorrow" if I weren't so full!
