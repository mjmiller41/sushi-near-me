        I'm saddened to write this review.

        My family has been coming here for over 10 years, and we've built so
        many memories around this place. Unfortunately, things have changed over
        the past year. We've had multiple visits where the rice was consistently
        soggy and mushy—definitely not the quality we were used to. Still, we
        kept giving it another chance, mostly because our daughter has always
        loved coming here.


        But on our most recent visit, I experienced something that truly turned
        us away for good. Every time I grabbed a plate from the belt, my fingers
        would stick to the bottom. Curious (and concerned), I flipped a few over
        to see what I was touching. What I found was disturbing—old bits of food
        stuck along the edges and a grimy film that actually scraped off when I
        ran a chopstick over it. It was obvious the plates hadn’t been cleaned
        properly.


        Sadly, after that meal, I ended up getting sick. And as heartbreaking as
        it is to say, we won’t be returning. It’s disappointing to see a place
        we’ve loved for so many years lose the care and quality that once made
        it.

        Ramen, outstanding flavor, fresh, very large  generous proportion for
        price, 2 star spicy was so perfect, heat wise for me.  Everyone was
        eating sushi 🍣 but I say RAMEN folks.

        I don’t like facing a wall, that’s my only negative and the chairs are
        low to ground and it wasn’t comfortable sitting 🪑.

        Not the point

        Food was yummy

        I was visiting family and friends and we ate here for a celebration.
        Employees were really nice. Prices depend on the color and it can be
        expensive, too. The sushi was decent. Nothing stand out, but it's a good
        spot to hang out.

        I like the atmosphere and the way the sushi comes to buy on a conveyor
        belt. When you get to the restaurant you realize your stomach is only so
        big and you can only eat so much so you really need to be picky about
        which plate you take. They all look good there was a couple that I
        really didn't care for but overall it's a good dining experience.
