        I took my family to celebrate my son’s birthday at Lu. We had such good
        time here. We ordered the Dragon Rainbow, Pink Lady, Sushi Deluxe. Spicy
        Beef bowl, Lu’s noodle soup, MaPo ToFu… everything is fresh and
        delicious. We enjoyed the food and the Jazz music. And the service is
        great. We will definitely come back.

        I recently had a dinner at Lu's yesterday and it was an exceptional
        experience. the crab rangoons and sushi impressed me most, both of which
        were incredibly delicious and well prepared.


        it offers some creative dishes that go beyond the traditional offerings,
        making for an exciting and memorable meal.


        Moreover, the service was excellent. The staff were attentive, friendly,
        and made sure that our dining experience was perfect from start to
        finish. highly recommend!

        As a Chinese-American, I’m not always trusting of sushi / Chinese
        combination restaurants, but Lu’s definitely hits the spot!


        I came with my family and we ordered the crispy beef, orange chicken,
        teriyaki salmon, sushi roll, Taiwanese beef noodle soup, and smoothies
        for the table. There are a mix of authentic and Americanized options
        available so worth asking if you’re not sure - I believe the chef is
        Taiwanese so they get some credibility there.


        Standouts were the beef noodle soup (super tender beef and good taste -
        comparable to what you can find at the Chinese Cafe in Westmont) and the
        crispy beef, which has a similar flavor profile to the orange chicken
        but, as the name suggests, is a bit more crispy. 😋 I believe their
        sushi chef came also came from Tao in Chicago which reflects in the
        quality of the rolls.


        Service was excellent and it’s a nice ambiance. I’m told they have
        musicians on certain weekend nights which draw a big audience. Hopefully
        it catches on more with the Naperville Chinese community, there’s
        definitely good eats to be had!

        Bright and inviting atmosphere.  Fast and friendly service, thanks
        Daniel for taking care of us.  Food was fresh and delicious.  From
        appetizer to dinner dishes were timed just right with just the right
        amount of time between.  Only recommendation is add traditional black
        tea as an option to green tea which was a little weak. Other than that
        highly recommended this place.
