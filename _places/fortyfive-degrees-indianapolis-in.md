        I'm going to keep it short and sweet This is some of the best Japanese
        food I've had ever. The customer service was amazing We came here
        unexpectedly because everything was closed and we were like the only two
        people in their eating. The tuna nachos were amazing. We had some dish
        that was sushi wrapped in foil that they had to set on fire so that it
        can be cooked right in front of us and when I tell you it was the best
        sushi ever Oh my God! To the kitchen personally to thank the chef.
        Everything was right on time and fresh. This is definitely our new go-to
        spot! I still can't get over how amazing this food was. The orange
        chicken was really good The rice just seemed a little to sweet. What a
        preferred a dryer Jasmine rice or even a basmati. But again you see I
        gave this completely five stars even with that. Bless this place is
        really a gem. And this isn't a computer-generated AI review this is the
        real deal 😂

        I'm going to keep it short and sweet This is some of the best Japanese
        food I've had ever. The customer service was amazing We came here
        unexpectedly because everything was closed and we were like the only two
        people in their eating. The tuna nachos were amazing. We had some dish
        that was sushi wrapped in foil that they had to set on fire so that it
        can be cooked right in front of us and when I tell you it was the best
        sushi ever Oh my God! To the kitchen personally to thank the chef.
        Everything was right on time and fresh. This is definitely our new go-to
        spot! I still can't get over how amazing this food was. The orange
        chicken was really good The rice just seemed a little to sweet. What a
        preferred a dryer Jasmine rice or even a basmati. But again you see I
        gave this completely five stars even with that. Bless this place is
        really a gem. And this isn't a computer-generated AI review this is the
        real deal 😂

        I have had a really hard time finding a good sushi restaurant in
        Indianapolis that wasn't a cookie cutter of every other around. I have
        to say that I was completely surprised by this restaurant. The service
        was beyond exceptional. Our waiter explained everything on the menu,
        offered his own personal favorites and had the best personality. The
        sushi itself was everything I have been looking for. I had the Shogun
        Shooters to start and I was blown away by the tenderness and taste of
        the sushi. It did even taste like I was eating fish which is a plus in
        my book. We also had the Hawaiian and Salmon Diablo that was wrapped in
        the soy paper which has been the best additions to these rolls. Much
        better than the traditional seaweed wraps. We walked out of there with 3
        rolls and 2 drinks for under $50 which by far is a great deal for how
        well this food was. They could almost charge more per roll and still
        have some of the best sushi in town. This is definitely a highly
        recommend and I will be coming back here from now on!!

        Our entire experience was great from start to finish. Mark was
        absolutely amazing and the hostesses were so warm and welcoming and all
        so pretty. We had kids with us and while they don’t have a kids menu
        there was plenty for our kids to pick and chose from. Granted our kids
        love sushi and our youngest is 2 so it was perfect for our situation.

        Absolutely enjoyed everything about 45 degrees. It was our first time
        there and everything was delightful. The sushi was very good and fresh.
        We absolutely loved the playboy roll being lit on fire. The Jelly sake
        in the photo was the first time I've had it and it was super sweet just
        like a jello shot. Our waitress was very sweet and knowledgeable. We
        will definitely be returning on our next trip to Indianapolis.

        I was pleasantly surprised at how empty this was when I came in because
        I’ve seen lots of reviews about this place (so I figured it would’ve
        been very busy). The service was great, our server was very friendly and
        attentive. The food was amazing and authentic, seafood was fresh, and
        very nicely presented. I particularly liked the spicy salmon roll, the
        Mass Ave specialty roll, and the crab rangoon. The area was clean and
        comfortable. The price was only around $100 for 4 people, which was
        shocking considering the amount of food we had. Would definitely
        recommend!
