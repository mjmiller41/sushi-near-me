        This place is such a hidden gem!

        Parking was easy, and we didn't have to wait for a table.

        The ingredients were super fresh, and the service was solid. We ordered
        three sushi rolls, and our favorite was king of orange. The place was
        packed that day, so it felt a bit hectic, and the extra order we added
        later took over 20 minutes. But once we mentioned it, the staff handled
        it really well.

        Overall, it was a great dining experience! If you're in the area or
        passing by, I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.

        My bf and I LOVE sushi plantation. Our go to sushi in OC. Their rolls
        are so unique and we especially appreciate their protein rolls (no
        rice). Anytime we want sushi, this is our date spot

        Went off the stars for this place thinking it was good, sad to say was a
        waste of time and money. Now maybe the sushi rolls are better.

        I ordered the Beef combination meal to get a taste of Miso Soup,
        California roll,salad, entree, rice.  The Miso soup was good, perfect
        not salty as in many places, the California rolls were OK.  The salad
        presentation was great, the dressing made everything taste like onions

        I feel cheated on the beef, cheap cut prepared with lots of baking soda
        to tenderize it, so you get a chewy soft gelatinous texture with a
        baking powder after taste, the teriyaki sauce was extremely sweet,
        probably to try to mask the baking soda taste.  The rice was not a
        Japanese rice, probably the cheapest rice you can buy, wasn't jasmine
        Thai rice either making it hard to pickup with chop sticks. The fruit,
        an orange was pretty stale. My wife had the salmon, she complained about
        a bitter after taste, I tasted it and sure enough, it had a bitter after
        taste almost as if the salmon was also washed in baking soda. Probably
        to get rid of any funky smell maybe???

        I don't think i would venture to go back and try something different

        What great food for such a little place . My sister and I went in and I
        let my sister do the ordering as she comes here more then I do . She
        picked out two dinners - The Sunrise on Avery Parkway to be on Soy paper
        - Dust in the Wind that comes on Soy paper - as well as the California
        Roll and a beer . We received the Avery not on Soy so they had to remake
        it sadly as my sister really wanted Soy since we were sharing our food
        and I am a newbie to sushi . The food was delicious and I give it a 5
        for freshness and taste . It took a little bit to make it but it’s ok it
        looked great and presentation is everything as well . There were lots of
        people working that day eager to help . This is a great place , very
        busy with indoor eating and busy with pick up orders .
