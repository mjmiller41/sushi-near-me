        Greeted immediately upon arrival, chose my table, and was greeted by my
        server quickly. She took the time to answer a couple of questions I had
        regarding some menu items and was very knowledgeable.  Food was
        fantastic and felt like a great value. I had general tso chicken and a
        side salad. I'll eat on it at least 3 times.

        Some of the best Hibachi Chicken I've ever had! Service was great, staff
        was very nice and the portion of food was huge! I recommend going here
        if you're wanting Japanese or Chinese food which they serve both.
        There's a lot on the menu to pick from as well.

        First time ordering. Figured we would switch it up from China wok. Even
        with higher prices I was still intrigued to try.


        Ordered Crab Rangoons, Gyoza, Teriyaki steak and two sushi rolls. The
        Rangoons and gyoza were SOGGY and COLD when I received them for takeout.
        Manager told me I had to RETURN the food and COME BACK for a refund.
        Other food was good, but refund policy is not normal or acceptable…


        Won’t be back. Would not recommend.

        Check your order before you leave the restaurant. After returning home
        and realizing a plate had been forgotten, we called and were offered a
        credit on the account.  Easy enough.  Next time we tried placing an
        order, there was no credit and “nothing they can do.”   Could easily
        have been remedied, but instead, here we are, leaving a one star review
        and ordering elsewhere next time. If you’re looking for reasonable
        customer service, there’s better in Boone.

        Disrespect on the Menu, Incompetence as the Special


        Hibachi orders aren’t made until they have enough to cook in
        bulk—straight from an employee’s mouth. We waited 30 minutes past our
        pickup time, watching our other food sit there getting cold while the
        staff barely acknowledged us. Only then did they finally start making
        our order, with an attitude like we were inconveniencing them.


        We asked for a refund and left foodless. If you enjoy paying to be
        ignored, disrespected, and treated like the loser in a Mean Girls
        bullying scene, congratulations—you’ve found the perfect place.

  What Visitors Are Saying About Taste Grill$$$Diners often praise the generous
  portions and tasty Asian dishes like hibachi chicken and sushi rolls, noting

  While some folks have mentioned occasional hiccups with takeout orders or wait
  times, the overall experience shines through with friendly service and
  knowledgeable staff helping out on menu questions. Many appreciate the variety
  on the menu, which covers both Chinese and Japanese options, making it a solid
  choice for a casual meal. Despite a few complaints about customer service in
  specific cases, the majority of feedback highlights the fantastic flavors and
  value that make this place worth trying. If you're hunting for reliable sushi
  spots nearby, it's clear that positives like the huge servings and welcoming
  vibe tend to outweigh the minor issues for most people.
