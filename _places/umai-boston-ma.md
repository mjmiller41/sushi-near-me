        Umai is a sushi & Japanese cuisine spot located in the heart of Newbury
        Street, with a nice comfy interior and some spots in the windows aimed
        out towards the street for eating and viewing.


        The staff were pretty welcoming and quick with service, ensuring that
        the food came out quick. The food was a bit on the expensive side for
        the portion, but is passable because it is located on Newbury Street.


        I got the lunch combo with spicy salmon and spicy california. It came
        served with miso soup and salad. Miso soup was pretty standard, and the
        salad had a nice dressing and was fresh. The spicy salmon was rolled
        nice, was fresh, and wasn't too fishy. The spicy california was a
        California roll with the spicy mayo on top, which was alright, the spicy
        mayo was good but nothing too outstanding.


        Overall, a good spot for sushi in Newbury Street, good for a chill lunch
        or casual date.

        Umai is our go-to sushi spot, and it never disappoints! The sushi here
        always hits the spot, especially the special makis, which we love
        ordering. The atmosphere and service are both excellent, making it a
        perfect choice for our date nights. We particularly enjoy sitting in the
        window seats, as it really enhances the overall experience. If you’re
        looking for delicious sushi in a great setting, I highly recommend Umai!

        Umai was kind of maa-maa.

        Service was decent enough, normal.

        Food wasn't bad, but not quite worth what was paid I feel. Presentation
        was nice.

        Window seats were pretty nice with the lighting.

        They did have quail egg, which was a nice surprise.

        For sashimi, I recommend the sake ))

        Ordered two lunch set bentos! (Salmon Steak & Fried Chicken) Both were
        fresh and the portions generous! I especially liked the variety as it
        included a few pieces of sushi, a spring roll, and a fried dumpling as
        small additions to the bento. Service was fast and overall it was a
        great experience!
