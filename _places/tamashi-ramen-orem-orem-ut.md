        The best shrimp fry rice, and the customer service is great. The wait
        time is not long.

        Tamashi Ramen is similar to California's food the best, and the price is
        cheaper.

        I try many places but is expensive and the food is so bad and the
        customer service is the same as the food all bad, but Tamashi Ramen have
        the best food in all Utah, thank you for the delicious food.

        You know what's better than good ramen? Inexpensive good ramen!


        Saw the reviews, and I'm staying at a nearby hotel. So I thought I'd
        check them out. I'm glad I did.


        I had the black Tonkotsu ramen. It could have used a touch more black
        garlic oil, but on a tenderness scale, the chashu pork was a 9 out of
        10. Great flavor, perfectly done noodles, all in a silky broth. They
        also have sushi and traditional Japanese fare. Definitely worth another
        visit next time I'm in town.

        One of our favorite places! Everything we've had is delicious. They have
        lots of kids options, and our teenagers love it as well. Quick service,
        friendly staff. Open Sunday.

        So many options, that is a good thing.  If there is a ramen combination
        you might like, I bet it is on the menu.  Not as flavorful as some but
        the condiments were there to be able to season to taste.  That is
        actually better for some who don't like as much flavor as others do. 
        While I applaud the desire to have as many people enjoying the food in
        the restaurant as possible, it was a little awkward to be as tightly
        packed in  as we were.
