        When we walked in it smelled like cigarettes and smoke in the air, we
        should have left but we gave it a shot anyways because the SoHo in
        Myrtle Beach is excellent. I attached photos of everything we left at
        the table. The food was horrible. I let the waitress know that the sushi
        roll had a foul taste to it, like rotten fish and she apologized but did
        not remove it from our bill. Pad Tai was sickly sweet and we couldn’t
        eat anything but the chicken in it. The vegetables were slimy as well.
        Rice was fine. We arrived at around 7:20pm and didn’t receive our food
        until 8pm. To wait 40minutes for garbage is crazy. Management needs to
        do something because on a Friday night, slow service, no customers in
        the building and awful food? I would be ashamed. $90 down the drain.

        Completely average, long wait time for the food considering no one was
        there when I arrived. Service was good from 2/3 employees, the third was
        a bit rough around the edges, but nothing I'm not used to. If the food
        was stellar I wouldn't be so picky, but I would say it's just okay.
        Nothing crazy, I'd come back if I was in the area, but it's nothing
        special.

        Smells like an ashtray in this restaurant.  The attached bar allows
        smoking inside.  The only separation between the restaurant and bar is a
        partial wall that doesn't go to the ceiling.  This gap allows smoke to
        fill the restaurant.  I had to shower when I got home to get the smell
        off of me.

        The service was great and the food was good.  However, I wouldn't
        recommend this place, nor will I ever go back.

        Would like to have given them a zero. Lady tells us we need reservations
        for 10 people.  I told her we have eaten there numerous times and no one
        has ever told us we needed a reservation. She said well I’m telling you
        now. I told her we didn’t have to eat there if it was a problem. She
        said Tuesday was a busy night for them and they already had two
        reservations. Really, two reservations for the whole restaurant?  She
        asked me if there was a problem. I told her the problem was with her
        attitude.  I asked my wife if she still wanted to eat there and the lady
        said it doesn’t matter, I’m not serving y’all.

        I’d never been here, as I normally go to Whitaker’s or King Kong, but
        Whitaker’s was super busy and I did feel like going to Carolina Forest.
        We sat at the bar. The service was horrible. The bartender never checked
        on us other than to take our order and give us our checks, and drink was
        undrinkable. It tasted like pure sour mix. I only took the one sip, and
        it sat there throughout our meal. When I asked if it could be taken off,
        the bartender told me that I should have asked earlier because the
        manager left and there was no one there to remove it from my check. The
        food was mediocre at best. Do yourself a favor and save your money. I’ll
        either wait or make the drive next time.
