        Nice experience. Short wait for seating at bar for lunch. Has normal
        eggrolls, Gyoza, and other items for someone like me who doesn't touch
        sushi. My wife enjoyed the salmon & salmon belly negri and was happy
        that they had Tamari (gluten free soysauce). At the price point per
        plate she says the quality of fish is adequate. Wasn't the best she ever
        had, but says it was better than Trappers and much better than what you
        get at a QFC. Overall service was good and had great conversation with
        other guests.

        If you care about variety, quality and excellent service, this is your
        sushi place! Forever Sushi is also one of the few places to have red,
        yellow and bluefin maguro (tuna).

        The husband and I had lunch here yesterday and I have to say the service
        was excellent. The young man that helped us was incredibly professional,
        polite and attentive. He is exactly what you would want every front of
        house employee to be. I couldn't have been more impressed watching him
        train a new employee and help the entire restaurant because he was
        alone.

        The food however is ok. My only yet biggest issue is everything that was
        on the belt was ice old. You can order everything fresh but when you do
        they make multiples of the items to add to the belt but there wasn't
        enough people inside at the time to require the amount of food that was
        still going around and around. We made the mistake of grabbing some
        fried oysters that were ice cold and even some of the new items they
        were adding were too cold.

        The best roll we had was the C Roll it's a California roll topped with
        creamy scallop and although the roll was bland the creamy scallop
        topping was incredible I've honestly never had better. The Korean BBQ
        wings were also extremely well fried and juice but the sauce was a
        little too thick and overwhelming but it left a really nice aftertaste
        of spicy garlic goodness. The Golden Road roll had too much sauce and
        was way too sweet for my liking and we didn't care for the dynamite
        roll. My husband enjoyed the mackerel nigiri and the gyoza but overall
        it was really pricey for the quality and there are better all you can
        eat sushi places where you can get more for less.

        They have the tuxedo mousse cake for a dessert option as well and that's
        hard to resist.

        We came here for the first time and loved it!  They have GF soy sauce. 
        I loved almost everything they had, but sadly I couldn't eat anything
        labeled "Krab Salad"  imitation crab that has wheat in it. Whaaa! 
        Hopefully they can switch to a hf product.  They do have real crab in
        some rolls.  I love their spicy tuna hand rolls!

        Came here a couple days ago and was so disappointed. We came here a
        little after 5:30 and the conveyor belt didn’t have that much sushi on
        it. I grabbed one of the sushi tempura and it was cold, seems like it
        had been there for a while. The sushi took so long that even the couple
        that sat a few minutes after us, walked out.


        The service is so terrible as well, if my kids wasn’t starving, I would
        have walked out too. The wait help ask us for our drink and I said water
        for us and he only came out with 2 waters just for me and my husband,
        uhmmm don’t he see the kids with us, don’t they need water too? He also
        just gave 2 chopsticks for me and my husband, I would’ve understand if
        he came back for forks for the kids but NO he didn’t, my husband had to
        go to the waithelp and asked for forks and at this time he ordered udon
        for my son, this is probably 5-10 mins after we sat down that we ordered
        the udon. At 6:05 my husband asked how’s the udon, waithelp said he’ll
        check on it. At 6:10 I asked the waithelp if the udon is coming as my
        son is so hungry. At 6:18 I asked again coz we’re almost done eating and
        the udon is still not coming out. The udon came out around 6:20ish. We
        waited about 30 mins for an udon that has only broth, noodles and onion
        on it. I didn’t enjoy our dinner as I couldn’t eat while I see my kid
        waiting patiently for his food and it wasn’t arriving.


        We came here a few months ago and we enjoyed it, the sushi was good, the
        conveyor belt was full of food and the service was great at that time,
        they even gave away those little clips at the end of the chopsticks for
        the kids, my kids enjoyed it at that time, that’s why we decided to come
        back and bring our friends with us. But this time, it was a let down, I
        regret bringing friends here. Our group of friends were disappointed as
        well, they asked for extra bowl for their kids and they had to asked 3
        times for it to arrived. I don’t recommend this place at all, go
        somewhere else especially if you have kids.
