        The staff here was so sweet! We only had an hour to eat because of our
        schedule, and they understood! The service was very fast, and all the
        servers were sweet. The sushi and teriyaki chicken tasted amazing, I
        can’t recommend this place enough! (Also their XL boba is comically long
        and it’s my favorite thing ever. It tasted great too)

        Had an overall good experience here. If I told you,"hey, there's this
        All You Can Eat Sushi place downtown" you'd likely invision something
        like this. Or it would be a step up, if you were expecting something
        like sushi buffet. It is not. They make it to order. So I'll give you
        the rundown if you feel like stuffing your face full of food. Oh, and
        don't try any funny stuff like secretly feeding your friend or taking
        extras home, or even overordering. Their warnings about these things are
        written literally everywhere. Lol


        Food

        First off, it's not just all you can eat sushi. The whole menu is
        practically available. Soup, Curry, Hibachi, Ramen, Salads, Dessert. The
        sushi was good. Not 10/10, but for endless sushi it was great. Plenty of
        options between sashimi, nigiri, rolls, etc. Did a 5 star on food just
        because of the value.


        Service

        It was very...there. The wait staff did their job adequately. Not
        friendly, not rude, just adequate. I was a bit disappointed that the
        Ramen I ordered came in a plastic bowl with a plastic spoon. With all
        the studies regarding micro-plastics, I'd REALLY avoid that dish in the
        future. Some don't care. I do.  Oddly, they had buttons behind your seat
        so you could page the staff to order or for help. Kind of forward
        thinking, but also can indicate the staff doesn't check on you really.
        But she did check on me once without me getting her attention, so kudos
        for that.


        Atmosphere

        Not bad, not achieving anything either though. Better than fast food,
        but felt like any chain restaurant. The best part of the atmosphere is
        the Omaha downtown. It's lovely and lively.


        Overall I'd recommend it if you're looking to go all you can eat a step
        up from asian cuisine buffets. Probably worth the $25 because endless
        custom oder sushi/ramen/hibachi is just not a popular thing. It's a
        niche experience. You gotta try it once at least.

        Came in for lunch, food was delicious. The Alaska Roll was so good.
        Service wasn’t great. We placed our initial order, then got asked by
        someone else if we had ordered, and then the person who took our initial
        order came and asked us if we had ordered. We ordered 2 more times. The
        second time, we had to basically raise the order above our head for it
        to be taken. There was a girl just standing at the bar zoned out and
        completely ignored us for 5+ minutes. The food was delicious though, my
        boyfriend really enjoyed the Mackerel.

        The all you can eat lunch is made to order and delicious. The price is
        just as much as ordering 1 or 2 rolls at other places but you get all
        you want! The rolls are big and very taste. I will definitely be going
        back, even to just order an appetizer and a few rolls from lunch. They
        have a call button when you are ready so a server isn't constantly
        interrupting which is a nice addition. They also have a to go option
        where you can order 2 apps and 3 rolls for the same price.

        A good deal for AYCE sushi during lunch. Although the sushi overall was
        good, the fish to rice ratio was off since there were lots of rice for
        sushi rolls, but it was expected for AYCE sushi. The yam tempura roll
        and the spicy tuna pizza were underrated. The shumai and the gyoza were
        alright. The chicken katsu with sauce was delicious and crispy. The rest
        of the sushi rolls were delicious. There's a call button if you're ready
        to order at your own convenience. Overall, this place gets 4.5 stars for
        reliable service and delicious food, just that the fish to rice ratio
        was a bit off. We had the Mexican roll, Shrimp tempura roll, Alaska
        roll, Crunchy roll, Yasai roll, Oshiko roll, salmon nigiri, white tuna
        nigiri, mackerel sushi, and spicy tuna sushi. There were claw machines
        in the restaurant which was unexpected.
