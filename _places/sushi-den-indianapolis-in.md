        IN INDIANAPOLIS, HANDS DOWN!!! 🍣🍱


        The fish was fresh, the presentation was immaculate, and the service was
        top tier! Our server, Diana, was so kind and thoughtful and checked on
        us to make sure we were good.


        For their spicy rolls, they hand cut the fish into small pieces and mix
        it with their blend of spicy sauce — I DONT THINK ANYONE UNDERSTANDS HOW
        RARE THAT IS IN INDY! Most places pre-mix their spicy rolls.


        We came in for lunch and their menu was extensive and the prices were
        unbelievably reasonable for the quality and portions you receive.


        I would recommend this to any and all sushi lovers who are craving an
        LA/NYC level sushi restaurant in the heart of Indy. This is the go-to
        spot for fresh, quality sushi in the city! 100/10


        Yes, it really is THAT good. Thank me later! 🙏

        Recommend coming here! Food was super ! we really enjoyed the food! It’s
        with great quality and taste. Everything we ordered was yummy. Wish we
        could eat more but we had late lunch so were kinda full beforehand. The
        interior was lovely and warm. The service was nice and prompt. We parked
        along side the street just before the restaurant. Paid parking along the
        street.

        My husband and I went here tonight for our anniversary. We had the BEST
        experience. The food was fantastic, the atmosphere comfortable &
        uplifting & the staff were amazing! Melanie was our waitress and she was
        extremely helpful.


        They even put out fresh flowers at every table!


        10/10. Can’t wait to come back.

        Valentine's dinner was amazing! Dinosaur egg, sweetheart roll, golden
        American roll, Mango tempura roll, and the smoked salmon roll were so
        delicious! Staff were very attentive and friendly. And a complimentary
        dessert and a rose to top off the evening were a nice touch!
