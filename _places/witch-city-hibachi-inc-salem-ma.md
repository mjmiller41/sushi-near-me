        Witch City Hibachi was a great find. So much on the menu, that I can’t
        wait to come back! Service was really good. Food surpassed our
        expectations; so did the martinis. You can order hibachi items without
        needing to go thru the whole teppanyaki presentation. Our hibachi
        entrees came with soup & salad. Steak & shrimp were excellent. Chicken
        was a bit small & a bit tough. Sauces were so good. Only disappointment
        was the “crab stick” use in the sushi. Ruins it for me, as real crab is
        what I want in sushi.

        Witch City Hibachi was a great find. So much on the menu, that I can’t
        wait to come back! Service was really good. Food surpassed our
        expectations; so did the martinis. You can order hibachi items without
        needing to go thru the whole teppanyaki presentation. Our hibachi
        entrees came with soup & salad. Steak & shrimp were excellent. Chicken
        was a bit small & a bit tough. Sauces were so good. Only disappointment
        was the “crab stick” use in the sushi. Ruins it for me, as real crab is

        Wow!  Best hibachi I have ever had.   Generous portions, cooked to
        perfection.  The salad dressing is also amazing.  I love hibachi, and to
        date this the is best I have had…yes much better than Benihana.  
        Another perk while visiting Salem in October, there wasn’t a line at
        lunch.  Easily walkable.  The people were friendly and the restaurant
        was very clean.   Top notch service.  We will be back for sure.  Be sure
        to give this place a try.

        We went Halloween night and was immediately sat without issues. Very
        good food! Salad, soup, tuna and avocado roll, and shrimp/steak hibachi
        was delicious. The Brussels sprouts were to die for. Drinks were
        incredible. Definitely recommend for something off the beaten path

        Both my husband and I ordered the filet and shrimp hibachi meal. Both
        proteins were very good taste wise! The shrimp was our favorite!! The
        portions were good sized and the salad and soup that came with it were
        great. I’ll miss this place when I go home!

        We order from this place very often, the food is delicious,  always
        everything fresh and good! The delivery os very prompt , really enjoy
        it! I gave 3 stars only because last time we ordered food for delivery
        and we were very suspicious of the holes were on some of the food
        containers. Not on all of them but the few. To me it looked like rodent
        bites , I called the restaurant and explained we could not eat the food
        in those containers because the holes look suspicious, the lady on the
        phone told me that they make the holes on purpose if food is too hot. I
        asked her to please if they could replace the food for us she said well
        it all safe and eatable. To me it is not. Sorry, I think if customer
        doesn't feel safe to eat something at the restaurant because it looks
        suspicious restaurant should just replace it. It the food we are talking
        about,  not some kind a toy or material i am asking about. Really was
        upset over it, we throw away the food and 3 containers with the holes in
        it, after paying over $200.00 for the delivery order. It is not right.
