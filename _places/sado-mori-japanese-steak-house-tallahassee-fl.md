        Sado Mori has great food. The sushi tastes fresh. The ginger salad
        dressing is tasty. I like to also get their miso soup as well. You can
        get a soup AND salad with your entree. You can choose to dine at a table
        or go to the hibachi area where they cook in front of you. It is a fun
        experience and a great place to bring your family!

        The sushi was pretty good, but the service sucks. Our waitress was very
        inattentive and we felt kind of ignored. When we got to the restaurant
        they were not busy and we were seated quickly, when we asked our
        waitress for a few minutes to look over the menu she said no problem -
        but then did not return for a really long time… once our sushi came out
        the sushi chef had made a mistake in including cream cheese on a roll
        that was not supposed to have any on it - this wouldn’t have been a big
        deal had our waitress come back to check on us but she didn’t…..my
        husband sat with a plate of sushi in front of him that he wasn’t going
        to eat for a good 20 minutes….the owner of the restaurant made a comment
        about our table having an issue to our waitress….and she chose to go
        greet other tables, grab other tables orders and do everything OTHER
        than coming to our table….thankfully the sushi chef noticed there was an
        issue and proceeded to remake my husbands sushi after speaking to him…
        our waitress went up to the sushi bar and looked very confused that we
        had another sushi order and my husband had to explain to her that the
        sushi chef had remade his food and told her he was going to eat his
        sushi quickly because we had been there for a long time…she leaves the
        check on our table and walks away - my husband walked up front to pay,
        making eye contact with our waitress - who quickly looked away and
        walked the other way to busy herself with something else. Everyone has
        an off night but this the 3rd time we come in and have this kind of
        service from THE SAME waitress…. We were closed out by another waitress
        and left…. not sure if I’ll be back - maybe I’ll just order to go next
        time….

        The restaurant is quite dated. The food was average. The waiter was more
        interested in flirting with the bartender, his boyfriend I guess, than
        in paying attention to his table. Not a fan of this establishment. The
        tuna appetizer came out half way through dinner….it was sushi, raw, what
        took so long!

        The tuna tataki was probably the best I've ever had, and I lived in
        Japan for 3 years.  They have great spicy tuna and hibachi meals.  Too
        bad I don't live near here.  I'd come back many times.  Easy to find
        with Google map.  Staff was great and location had plenty of parking.
