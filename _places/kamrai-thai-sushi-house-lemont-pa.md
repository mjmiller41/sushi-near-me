        We heard great things about this restaurant and decided to try it. The
        atmosphere was nice, although the place was so cold. We were both
        freezing the entire time. We ordered a dragon roll and it was fantastic.
        Then my husband ordered a beef dish that he liked. I ordered the pad
        Thai and it was terrible. It tasted and smelled like the chicken was
        bad. I told the waitress and she apologized and offered to have someone
        remake the dish, but I declined. There was a server who continued to
        walk by and go to the next table and giggle with the patrons at that
        table. The staff seemed like a lot of young people who weren’t overly
        interested in their jobs. I would go back strictly for the sushi, but
        otherwise we were not at all impressed.

        walk by and go to the next table and giggle with the patrons at that
        table. The staff seemed like a lot of young people who weren’t overly
        interested in their jobs. I would go back strictly for the sushi, but
        otherwise we were not at all impressed.

        The reviews on this place seem to be pretty hit or miss. We experienced
        a bit of both. We started with sushi, which was quite good. We got the
        Dragon Roll. For meals, I ordered Bangkok Beef and my wife got Pad Thai.
        Mine was pretty good but hers was quite bad. She thought the chicken was
        rotten but it permeated the whole dish. Not sure if it was spice or
        something else but we had a couple bites and left it. We probably had
        4-5 different wait staff working with us. We told one of them what we
        experienced. She apologized and offered to bring another but we
        declined. We never saw her again. We ended up paying for a terrible
        dish. My wife says she would come back. I would not.

        Went here with wife and friends on a Saturday night. She got the Pad
        Thai and it just tasted… off. Too sweet for sure and all around
        mediocre. I had the Kaprao Khai Dao and it was delicious. Others at our
        table enjoyed what they had but none of us felt like it was worth the
        wait (an hour to be seated and then almost an hour to get the food), the
        slow service, etc.

        Thai foods are average at best, Sushi’s are below average, Had the worst
        Tuna Sashimi here. Both menus were overpriced. Waited 40 min for our
        food, waiter also forgot to give us menus when we first sat down.

        We had a party 5.  We reached a table fairly quickly.  We were provided
        menus shortly after being seated.  Then for 40 minutes we never saw a
        wait person.  Not even once, we were not even offered beverages.   After
        waiting 40 minutes we left.  On the way out, a member of the wait staff
        acknowledged us leaving and just shrugged their shoulders at me.
