        Amazing sushi!   Sushi pro is now at the top of our list of sushi
        restaurants in the SJ area.    We stopped here for lunch as many of the
        Japanese restaurants were busy and we decided to take the short drive
        here.


        The restaurant is located in a busy mall area and parking can be a bit
        crowded, but there are lots of spots.   We were able to get seated
        quickly and made our orders quickly.


        The sashimi was exceptional!  Very large pieces of fresh cuts and we
        will definitely order again.  Sushi was also very good as was the
        tempura dinner set.   I ordered the steamed clams as I love them and
        would say they were good, but would definitely skip the Japanese style
        okra.


        Overall would highly recommend!

        This sushi place is simply wow! The sushi is incredibly fresh and
        absolutely delicious—every bite feels like a treat.

        What truly sets this place apart, though, is the outstanding service.
        The staff are so attentive, warm, and professional, making me feel
        welcomed every single time I visit.

        On top of that, the service is impressively quick, yet nothing ever
        feels rushed. It’s a perfect blend of amazing food and exceptional
        hospitality.

        My wife and I had a good time for our valentine's day dinner. I had the
        salmon teriyaki. It was a nice gesture they had chocolate and a rose.
        One down side is the space is a bit small. I would love it if it would
        expand to a bigger place. Other then that would definitely come back on
        another special occasion.

        I absolutely love this new find! The food is AMAZING! I come to town
        monthly and look forward to making this a must-have while I'm there. The
        fish is very fresh and their rolls are fun and delicious. I've had a few
        other sushi spots near by but they have not even come close to this
        spot! Sadly I don't have pics to add. I will try and update after my
        next visit!
