      text: "If you’re serious about sushi in SLC, Takashi is the spot—but get there before they open if you want to make the first seating. It fills up fast for a reason.\n\nWe started with the pear salad, which had great flavor and texture. The pickled pear had a subtle, addictive tang I couldn’t quite place, and the mix of greens, seeds, and creamy cheese hit all the right notes.\n\nCalamari came out as a massive portion. The dipping sauce carried the dish—calamari was decent, not super flavorful on its own but fried well and not greasy.\n\nFried oysters were visually stunning, served in-shell. Crunchy and clean, though I’ve had better. Still solid.\n\nEdamame dumplings were the best appetizer by far. Super rich broth, great texture, and savory flavor in every bite—don’t skip these.\n\nThe steak with vegetable tempura was beautifully cooked and plated. Steak was juicy and flavorful, and the tempura (especially the portobello) was crisp and not overly oily.\n\nNow the sushi—fresh across the board. Favorites:\n•\tSquid, bonito, mirugai, masaba were the standouts.\n•\tUni was sweet and creamy.\n•\tAlso enjoyed: chutoro, iwashi, razor clam, amaebi—all fresh and handled well.\n\nOur server was fantastic—welcoming, attentive, and made sure we were taken care of throughout the meal. The sake recommendation she gave us paired really well with the nigiri. Only suggestion: it would be great if the larger bottles of sake came with a chilled bucket to keep it cool through the meal.\n\nTop-tier experience overall. Can’t wait to go back."

        Let me start with Aaron, Tony, and Zach, made this a wonderful dining
        experience. Personable and attentive, with knowledge and a passion for
        their work. All our food was delicious. Asian cesear, tempura vegetables
        sushi of all types and even the mango mousse to finish it off. I
        recommend sitting at the bar as it provides a very different experience.
        Limited seating for such a popular place leads to lines and waits so
        arrive early, stand in the line and give this place a shot.

        Unbelievably superb! My only complaint? I can’t come here every single
        day. Everything about this place is exceptional. The only thing on the
        menu you won’t like is… well, nothing—if you know what I mean.


        Service? Once again, unbelievably superb. Emily was our waitress, and we
        rolled in eight deep—yet she didn’t miss a single beat, down to the
        toothpicks. The communication amongst the staff was on another level.

        You can tell when a place is well-run, and this is a perfect example.
        When I made a request from my waitress, it didn’t get lost in
        translation. Instead of playing the usual game of “Who ordered this?” my
        request came straight to me. From a third party. Wow.


        Superb in every way.


        Bring your friends for a very nice dinner out!


        A parent's birthday or any other occasion will be special.


        Don't forget to ask for Emily@

        We wanted sushi and heard this was the best place. It's a fun location
        with a cool vibe. We had three rolls, Black Magic Woman, Strawberry
        Fields and Ramon. I liked them best in that order. Ramon I would not
        order again, it was just kind of bland, but the other two rolls were
        great!

        We love the vibe and the food. It's one of the more expensive sushi
        places in the valley but with good reason. The quality is fantastic.


        While we enjoyed each roll we ordered, we especially liked the Black
        Magic Woman.


        The Candy Cap Pana Cotta for dessert was delicious as well.
