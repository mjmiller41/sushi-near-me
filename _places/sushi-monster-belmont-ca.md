        My new personal favorite for Sushi. The service is excellent and the
        food is fresh. I enjoy the shrimp tempura and the different options for
        sushi - of which there are many. My go-to choices are either “G-Spot” or
        “Washington Roll” for the sushi. I also liked the rainbow roll and the
        Mackerel.

        food is fresh. I enjoy the shrimp tempura and the different options for
        sushi - of which there are many. My go-to choices are either “G-Spot” or
        “Washington Roll” for the sushi. I also liked the rainbow roll and the
        Mackerel.

        Sushi monster is a fun sushi option for a large variety of rolls. It is
        always busy during lunchtime and there is a wait if you drop in during
        rush hour.


        The restaurant is run like a mom and pop shop and gives off those vibes.

        Parking is only street parking.

        Very attentive..  Food was good.  A bit over priced in my opinion.  That
        being said I would return.  The salad dressing not the greatest.  But
        the miso was delicious and so was the Thai ice tea. I ordered short ribs
        which was a large portion.  My friend ordered the sushi and tempura she
        enjoyed it.

        We went here a little after lunchtime and this place was busy.  Inside
        was simply decorated.  Every time someone enters, the whole crew happily
        greets you.  It is definitely a welcoming vibe.


        I placed an order to go, and the 2 ladies there were happy to help.


        I ordered:


        1.  Teriyaki steak (dinner portion) - The teriyaki steak came with salad
        and miso soup. They told me the order was a bigger portion, which was
        perfect for my husband.  I'm glad I ordered an extra order of rice, even
        after they said that the rice was more than enough.  Sorry, we are
        filipino and love our rice, lol. The steak was super tender and
        flavorful.


        2.  Combo B2 (bul-gogi, beef teriyaki, bbq beef short rib, 3 pcs CA
        roll, and 2 pcs shrimp tempura) - This was perfect for me. A sampler of
        all the meats.  All the meats were so tender, but all stood out in their
        own way. They didn't taste like they were marinated all in the same
        sauce if that makes sense. Each one stood out on their own. I loved
        it.   The shrimp tempura was not the standard one that we all know. This
        one was light and crunchy.  It's not soggy and greasy likeli how the
        other shrimp tempuras get.  I wish I had ordered more rice because the
        portions were on point.


        3. Gyoza - This was crispy and crunchy.  Almost felt like it was deep
        fried and not pan-fried like other places. It was also a 2  biter for
        me,  not where you usually pop a whole one in your mouth.


        4.  Spicy tuna roll - To my surprise, it wasn't spicy, but it was
        flavorful.


        5. Godzilla roll - I think this is the standard dragon roll. Their
        dragon roll didn't have shrimp tempura. This was delicious.


        I highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back. The only bummer
        was that their credit card machine wasn't working when I went. Had to
        pay Venmo. Good thing I had Venmo. This place was a little pricy but
        well worth it.

        6/1/23:

        Spider Roll is delicious and tastes as if real crab. Golden Roll (Fried
        California) is a new GoTo roll for me here, nicely prepared, good
        presentation. Edamame is the largest portion I've seen to date in a
        sushi restaurant....and served within minutes. ICE COLD Sapporo served
        in a frozen mug actually froze some of the beer in the top of my glass,
        excellent. Only mild complaint is pricing, highest in area, but as long
        as sushi is top notch, I'll continue to come back. 4.8 Stars (-.2 for
        pricing).


        Previous:

        Great overall experience. Very attentive staff, greeted as I walked in
        the door (and everyone else as well). Drink and appetizer served within
        a minute or 2 of walking in the door. Although the Edamame wasn't piping
        hot, it was warm+ and plentiful, but a couple dollars more than other
        locations. The beer was served with a frozen mug...unlike most others,
        and a big plus (helped earn the 5 stars. Since ALL CRAB IS IMITATION
        HERE, and no choice for substitution, I ordered a smoked salmon roll
        instead of the traditional California. Only 6 pieces here (instead of
        typical 8), making each piece more expensive as well. I finished off
        with a Firecracker roll. It hit the spot, but might continue doing so
        all evening. Florida sushi restaurants don't know what heat is relative
        to this roll. Overall great experience, but I do side with Chris Wahl's
        comments (below) though in regards to price.
