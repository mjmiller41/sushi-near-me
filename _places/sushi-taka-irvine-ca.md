        We’ve ordered from this location over 75-100 times! We’ve never had a
        reason to interact with their staff until today, when we had an issue
        with our order. We wanted to make a change to the roll we ordered and we
        were told there was nothing they could do for us given they had already
        started preparing our order… what? All we wanted to do was add an item
        on. We pushed it further and said surly there’s something we can do, so
        she “spoke to the chef” who basically said no. So long story short, I
        hope one day they realize that loyal customers are worth way more than
        what a simple customer service gesture would have cost them.

        We’ve ordered from this location over 75-100 times! We’ve never had a
        reason to interact with their staff until today, when we had an issue
        with our order. We wanted to make a change to the roll we ordered and we
        were told there was nothing they could do for us given they had already
        started preparing our order… what? All we wanted to do was add an item
        on. We pushed it further and said surly there’s something we can do, so
        she “spoke to the chef” who basically said no. So long story short, I
        hope one day they realize that loyal customers are worth way more than
        what a simple customer service gesture would have cost them.

        I don’t understand the reviews hating on the customer service here. I’ve
        been like seven times and they’re always really cool and nice. Maybe
        they started out understaffed and that led to the problems. But anyway
        the sushi is good and I recommend this place.

        I wanted to share some feedback regarding my recent experiences at your
        restaurant. Previously, I have always been able to call ahead to place
        my order before arriving, which saved me valuable time. However, last
        night, a waitress informed me that the chef no longer allows phone
        orders. Instead of waiting 20 minutes to place my order in person, I
        would much prefer the option to call ahead, as I have done in the past.


        Additionally, I have noticed a significant issue with portion sizes when
        ordering through DoorDash. Each order consistently arrives with only
        four small pieces, yet two small orders cost $51. In comparison, other
        sushi restaurants provide 8 to 10 pieces per order at half the cost.
        This discrepancy in pricing and portion size is disappointing and has
        led me to reconsider my patronage.


        Unfortunately, due to these recent changes, I have decided to take my
        business elsewhere. I wanted to bring this to your attention in case you
        were unaware of these concerns.

        I really enjoyed my lunch at Taka! I had two different rolls + some
        sushi and it was delicious, fresh, and well prepared and designed. The
        server was very nice and kind. The place is also clean and cozy! They
        have a great happy hour deal which is all day long during the weekends!
        I highly recommend this place.

        This is by far the worst sushi restaurant I have ever been to. They are
        so disrespectful and add a tip without authorization. Avoid this place
        at all costs and the lady working there is so rude and has a bad
        attitude.
