        I liked this place so much I ate here twice in a row. The hallmark of
        good sushi is the rice and usually, all you can eat spots serve
        Americanized style sushi with poor rice quality. Not here. The rice is
        well vinegared and seasoned and nicely moist. The raw fish is fresh.
        There’s a pretty good selection of nigiri with options you might
        commonly find in Japan but less so in the USA—like raw scallop—so you
        are not only limited to the nauseating fried, avocado-ed or cream cheese
        westernized rolls. Though surprisingly, those are done well here.


        The best part is the super friendly and good vibes. Everyone on the
        staff, from waiters to the cooks, seem to be friends, joking around with
        one another while still being attentive to the customers and seem
        genuinely appreciative of your patronage.

        My friend and I went for dinner one evening last week. I have been there
        a few times. The Sushi is always good and fresh, service is usually
        pretty good and i love the environment. When we went this past time I
        ordered a calamari roll. The server brought a similar-looking roll to
        the table and I ate about half of it. As I was halfway through with it
        it she brought another roll to the table and said it was the calamari
        roll. I was unaware that i was eating shrimp, which I'm allergic to
        (They were both breaded and fried in these particular rolls so the
        difference wasn't highly noticeable). I ended up turning very red and
        itchy so we explained to the server what had happened. She thought we
        were ordering another shrimp roll so she brought it out. She also
        brought one other incorrect roll to our table during all of this. I told
        the sushi chef and he became very emotional (very kind but not going to
        save me at ths point). They offered box my remaining rolls and allow me
        to take it to go even though we ordered all you can eat. I went home and
        experienced anaphylaxis about an hour after ingesting, had to use my
        epi-pen, go to primary care and then urgent care as the allergen hadn't
        fully left my system by the next day. They gave us 20 percent off. It
        was not the best experience of my life. If I return I will definitely
        sit at the bar. 20 percent off was inadequate compensation for all of
        the trouble that it caused.
