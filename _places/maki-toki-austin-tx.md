        Maki Toki was the first restaurant I tried sushi at and I will never
        need to try anywhere else. My mind was blown beyond expectations with
        the selection of sushi available, the amazing customer service, and the
        high quality sushi that is served. This is one of the best family owned
        restaurants in the Austin area and not just when it comes to sushi. Our
        server Tima has provided excellent and thorough service for us time and
        time again. My favorite aspect of Maki Toki is how beautifully the food
        is presented on every occasion AND they have the best tasting/strongest
        margaritas you can find.

        Ordered takeout. Immediately get a message that says they are super busy
        and the order will take 45 minutes. Unfortunately for them I was sitting
        outside and could see the restaurant completely empty. I go in after 15
        minutes and they have the order out immediately and the girl smirks at
        me and says "made fresh just for you". Who says that? Give them the
        benefit of the doubt? Nope. Food was old and chewy and clearly been
        sitting out and tasted kind of sour. On top of all that I paid
        ridiculous fees to order online. Never going back.

        This is the first established that I have encountered that has a
        separate menu for their AYCE items, which is more limited. I had to
        constantly compare the two menus to see if the rolls I wanted was AYCE.
        It was a good place to try and a good time for date night.

        Honestly one of the worst meals I’ve ever eaten.


        I’m not sure the restaurant owner has any idea what “tempura” means. Or
        “katsu”. Or “sushi” for that matter.


        I ordered a tonkatsu bento. Even the rice was awful: it was freaking
        *minute rice*. Yes, that’s right, a 22 dollar “Japanese” meal came with
        instant rice, and it wasn’t even shortgrained rice. Instead of katsu
        sauce, it included some rank pink sauce (NOT yumyum sauce, as I had
        initially hoped). Instead it veggie tempura, it came with three pieces
        of oily fried vegetables with no panko anywhere on them. The katsu
        itself was also foul, drenched in old oil and breaded in some stuffy,
        dense garbage instead of panko.


        Even the California roll managed to be pointless, though perhaps that
        was due to not even coming out with wasabi.


        And the prices? Like, I can’t cut them a break, I paid 30 dollars for
        lunch with a soda. The only way you’re hitting that 10-20 dollar range
        the google page claims is if you just order miso soup and don’t leave a
        tip.


        Abysmal. I hate to be so negative but there was ***nothing*** redeeming
        about this. Not a single decent item.

        Each piece was fresh, beautifully presented, and bursting with flavor. I
        especially loved the Dragon Roll and Sweet Stacy Roll. The Dragon Roll
        had the perfect balance of flavors with its rich eel and avocado, while
        the Sweet Stacy Roll was a delightful mix of sweetness and savory
        goodness that I couldn’t stop raving about. Every bite was a treat
