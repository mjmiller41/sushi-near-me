        We had the chicken teri roll, philly roll, gyosa sampler, and shrimp
        fried rice. Both sushi rolls were tasty with a nice ratio of
        ingredients. The gyosa sampler was fried well and is a nice way to try
        multiple fillings - all were good, the vegetable was probably my
        favorite. The shrimp fried rice has a unique, spiced flavor with a huge
        portion of rice with lots of shrimp, especially for the price. Good
        value overall!

        We had the chicken teri roll, philly roll, gyosa sampler, and shrimp
        fried rice. Both sushi rolls were tasty with a nice ratio of
        ingredients. The gyosa sampler was fried well and is a nice way to try
        multiple fillings - all were good, the vegetable was probably my
        favorite. The shrimp fried rice has a unique, spiced flavor with a huge
        portion of rice with lots of shrimp, especially for the price. Good
        value overall!

        They were so accommodating to us. My fiancé took me and our son here to
        enjoy an early dinner and EVERYTHING was 10/10. The first thing Lana did
        was greeted us and asked what she could cut the tv on to help entertain
        our son. TALK ABOUT TOP NOTCH SERVICE. Not to mention she was so kind
        and patient. I tried my first sushi ever (Lorenzo Roll) it was amazing.
        Not to mention the servings were great as well for the price. Thank you
        so much we will DEFINITELY be back.

        Ordered on DoorDash, they decided they didn't wanna make $30 dollars
        worth of my food and sent it anyway! Literally have checkmarks next to
        what they actually made and packed out. It took TWO hours to even be
        delivered. Horrid customer service that immediately blamed the dasher as
        soon as I called to complain. Real convenient that they didn't make the
        most expensive parts of my order. Go elsewhere, you will save your
        money!

        I recently dined at Sushi Hero, and I must say it was an exceptional
        experience😄 As someone who typically steers clear of raw food, I
        decided to step out of my comfort zone and ordered the 'Hibachi Single
        Order - Salmon' and the 'Lorenzo Roll.' To my surprise, the flavors were
        out of this world, and I couldn't get enough. The freshness of the
        ingredients and the expert preparation truly impressed me👍


        What made my visit even more special was the fantastic service. I
        arrived close to closing time, with limited knowledge of sushi
        varieties, but the server (Mr. Pujo) went above and beyond to guide me🥰
        Their recommendations, including the 'Lorenzo Roll,' were absolutely
        delicious, and I appreciated their patience and kindness.


        Thanks to this memorable experience, I've found a new appreciation for
        sushi, and I'm now a regular at Sushi Hero✨️ The quality of the food and
        the exceptional service have won me over, and I can't wait to explore
        more of their menu. Sushi Hero has definitely become one of my favorite
        dining spots! ✿˘◡˘✿

        This is by far the best sushi I have tasted in town. My wife and I love
        sushi but have not gotten what we really crave and that’s just good
        fresh original sushi. This place had it at amazing prices. I will never
        get my sushi any where else. Absolutely amazing. My two custom rolls and
        a salad were only 18.00 plus tax.
