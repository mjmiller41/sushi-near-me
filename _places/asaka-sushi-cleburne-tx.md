        The inside of this restaurant is beautiful! The service was great. The
        food was okay. I ordered the chicken katsu. It was fried to perfection,
        but it was very bland and the katsu sauce they use seemed too salty.
        Also ordered a dragon roll, I believe. It was decent.

        FISH ALLERGY ALERT!!!  Although the menu lists "Crab or Crabmeat" on
        certain items, IT IS KRAB meat, which is an imitation crab meat that is
        made with various types of FISH.....and to a person with fish allergies,
        that misrepresentation could have deadly consequences.  My Rainbow Roll
        was warm when served, the sushi rice had a mealy texture and the salmon,
        white fish and tuna were far from fresh.  Miso soup is usually a good
        litmus test for a sushi restaurant, so we should have known to leave
        after the soup was served.  It was obviously made from a powdered
        concentrate and was just terrible.  Not only did the "manager on duty"
        refuse to take the Rainbow Roll off of our bill, she was going to have
        the server pay for it out of her pocket if we refused to pay!  A
        TERRIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICE and a RED FLAG FOR ALL CUSTOMERS CONSIDERING
        EATING THERE.  The actual owners/manager were called and they acquiesced
        to removing the charge from our bill and not forcing the server to
        pay.   Our server however was wonderful.  She was very kind and
        understanding and the "manager on duty" should take a play from her
        book.
