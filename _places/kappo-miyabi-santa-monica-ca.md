        Was touring Santa Monica area and came upon this sushi restaurant. We
        were immediately greeted and immediately sat down at the sushi bar.


        We had several appetizers from the lamb chop to a soft shell tempura
        crab, and then we went on to an assorted sushimi and other great
        dishes..


        Everything was delicious and I have to say it was one of the best soft
        shelf crabs I've ever had. I order it all the time and in all types of
        restaurants, and I would say this was the best.


        The only thing that didn't pan out was the lamb chop, it was way
        overcooked. Lamb is supposed to be served medium-rare. Whether you like
        medium-rare or not. This was well done, but I'm not dinging him for
        that.


        Otherwise, we had a wonderful time, great service, great people working
        there really enjoyed it.

        Early dinner at the sushi bar was lovely. Chef recommended the fresh
        mackerel which did not disappoint. I thoroughly enjoyed the spicy tuna
        on crispy rice which was so big I struggled to pick each piece up with
        my chopsticks.

        Kappo Miyabi is an absolute gem in Santa Monica! From the moment you
        step in, the atmosphere immerses you in a blend of authentic Japanese
        elegance and modern charm. The food is nothing short of spectacular –
        fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented.


        The Omakase experience is a must-try, offering a curated selection of
        sushi and sashimi that feels like a true culinary journey. Every bite
        bursts with fresh ingredients and masterful preparation. Standouts for
        me were the Truffle Salmon Carpaccio and Albacore Sashimi – absolute
        perfection!


        The service is equally impressive. The staff is attentive, friendly, and
        knowledgeable, always ready to offer recommendations and ensure every
        detail is just right.


        Whether it’s a special occasion or just a regular night out, Kappo
        Miyabi delivers an unforgettable dining experience. Highly recommend
        this spot for anyone looking to enjoy authentic Japanese cuisine at its
        finest!

        Fun place with very gracious folks. We really loved the sea bass
        croquettes, and followed with two hot stone rice bowls, eel and salmon.
        The unagi was well prepared and their sauce is less BBQ and more subtle.
        Plenty of eel. Same with the salmon, not over seasoned. Rice was also
        fine and we will go back for raw fish next visit; their omakase choices
        look good. Had a nice few desserts including persimmon and ice cream and
        a great stout Japanese beer.

        As an avid sushi seeker, I came with high expectation due to reviews.
        However, it did not meet my expectations. We ordered sushi omakase
        ($100), unagi stone hot pot, and few other dishes. As for the omakase,
        the quality of the fish was average and rice (shari) was disappointing.
        When it comes to pricy sushis, I expect good quality from not only the
        fish but the base as well. Also for something that cost 100, I expected
        something better than a take out tray presentation. As for Unagi stone
        hot pot, it was actually decent! Unagi was flavorful, soft and juicy.
        Soft crab roll (current season special), I do not recommend. Bitter, dry
        and bland. Overall, this place has average sushi and few good warm
        plates. I recommend sticking to cooked dishes over sushis. Their sushis
        are priced ridiculously high for subpar quality and presentation.
