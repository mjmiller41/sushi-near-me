        Ordered $50 of food - shrimp, chicken and steak with rice, noodles and a
        side of the spring rolls. Food was so overcooked and dry. They tried to
        add sauce on top but really chewy meat, can’t be saved. I called they
        didn’t offer a refund but offered a credit. As someone not interested in
        trying again, it was unhelpful. However, she was nice on the phone and
        said she will call me back. We will see!

        I've been here about 4 or 5 times now, and I gotta say, I love this
        place. The crab cheese tempura (no pic, I was too busy eating it lol)
        was hot & the crab tasted fresh, the batter was very crispy yet soft.

        ⠀This time around, the brown sauce on the steak was too salty, although
        this is my first time thinking that. They're usually good about
        balancing their food, so it's nothing to worry about — the white dipping
        sauce on the side made up for that anyway. The atmosphere is somewhat
        quiet, but I wouldn't say it's awkward, and the staff is always very
        attentive to your needs. They'll often check up on you & ask if
        everything is okay, which is highly appreciated, and all of them still
        wear masks here.


        ⠀The food portion, as you can see, is massive. I always end up having to
        take the extras home, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. More bang for
        your buck, right? If I had to complain about anything, it'd be that I
        wish they had more variety, since the dinner menu boils down to combos
        of rice, vegetables, and your choice of a protein. There appear to be a
        lot of sushi options, unfortunately I'm not a fan of sushi.

        ⠀Delicious food overall; I'd recommend going there. They also offer
        online pick-up on their website, which I've done on occasion.

        The sushi items we got were fantastic & fresh. The hibachi food wasn’t
        the best, but not bad. We did find a hair in the hibachi chicken. The
        miso soup was delicious. The seafood soup was pretty much a clam chowder
        which is not what we expected. Tempura veggies were very good! The woman
        who  worked at the front counter was a sweetheart. Overall, would
        probably just get sushi and tempura next time. Would maybe like to try
        the noodles too.

        Saddest part is this place deserved less than 1 star. First, the
        waitress got part of our order completely wrong. I informed her and
        asked for the correct food. 15 mins later, she came back and asked if we
        still wanted the correct food. I asked why they hadn't put it on yet.
        She said the chef said it would take too long because it was frozen. I
        said forget it and I wasn't paying for incorrect food. For the next 20
        mins, she ran past our table and would not stop. I had to yell to her to
        ask for the bill. At the register, we were asked why we didn't pay for
        the wrong food. The nerve, especially since it sat there for 20 mins
        while we waited for the correct food that never came. The rest of the
        food was mediocre. The shrimp ramen soup tasted like the threw frozen
        shrimp, noodles, and veggies in a bowl of hot water. Such a
        disappointing meal. Thought it would be good, since others raved about
        this place.

        I had the Sexy Jalapeño appetizer.

        As well as the OMG roll.

        I was blown away by the quality, presentation, and taste. You can tell
        the chef has a passion for what he does. I didn't want to be that guy
        who takes pictures of his food. But honestly next time I will. I can't
        even find google images that look as good as what the chef prepared this
        evening. It was a beautiful presentation, accompanied by an amazing
        taste.

        I have lived in the area for 5 - 6 years and had never stopped in. I
        will be a regular from this moment on. Honestly this is the best I have
        had in probably 20 years.
