        This had to be the cleanest buffet I've been to in years. Decor is very
        Instagramable. The food looked fresh. I had the crawfish, which was very
        tasty. It was actually boiled in seasoning and not just plain water,
        then dry seasoning thrown on top. My daughters enjoyed hot pot, sushi,
        and hibachi. We will definitely be back.

        Happy to have discovered this brand new buffet which opened recently. It
        met all my expectations and more. Tried it out on a very busy Sunday
        rush. Had to check in and had 10 tables ahead of my party. The line
        moved very quickly then was seated. The staff were absolutely friendly
        and helpful. I really liked the aesthetics and mostly the variety of
        food selection that was actually hot to enjoy. I ate hot pot, sushi, and
        awesome desserts. The super picky kids will enjoy it. The slushy machine
        was a bonus! Best spot in the area with great prices for now. The only
        feedback I would add is to put swinging doors and safe mats on the floor
        where the employees serve the drinks for the safety of both customers
        and employees.

        This was a good joint. The servers were friendly and prompt with the
        drinks. They are very busy but make you feel like you’re the only one in
        the room. Service is 5 star. They have a great variety of food. My only
        complaint is that the food is bland. The food has great presentation but
        needs more flavor. I loved the hibachi and deserts. Other than that,
        this was a great place.

        The staff is efficient and provides excellent service.

        The food is quite good, but the cake flavors could be improved.

        Since it’s newly opened, there’s a large crowd—even during non-peak
        afternoon hours, the line is still long.

        They offer snow crab legs on weekends, but if that’s not a priority for
        you, visiting on a weekday might be a better option.

        The number of customers exceeds the restaurant’s capacity, so food takes
        longer to arrive, and the crowded space makes it easier to bump into
        others. Other than that, it’s perfect!

        The food were cooked perfectly and was refilled constantly. This place
        is huge and decorated well! There are sooooo many tables. Can't imagine
        what this place look like on the weekend. I like the soup/hibachi
        station, my soup broth was very good 💯
