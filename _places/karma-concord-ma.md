        Excellent hot and cold food! Our first time we got some noodle dishes
        and some hot veggies and scallion pancake. Only the pancake was meh,
        everything else was great.


        Second time was last night and we got the yellowtail hamachi special
        roll, spicy salmon, and sweet potato rolls. They took over an hour to
        get them out because they are also fulfilling takeout orders… but the
        first one was definitely something to write home about! Black tobiko and
        sadachi (lime) was a heavenly combo! The pineapple rum drink was
        excellent. And the miso soup was so rich and delicious!


        Servers and owners are all very nice! Also accommodated my allergy with
        zero issues.

        Excellent hot and cold food! Our first time we got some noodle dishes
        and some hot veggies and scallion pancake. Only the pancake was meh,
        everything else was great.


        Second time was last night and we got the yellowtail hamachi special
        roll, spicy salmon, and sweet potato rolls. They took over an hour to
        get them out because they are also fulfilling takeout orders… but the
        first one was definitely something to write home about! Black tobiko and
        sadachi (lime) was a heavenly combo! The pineapple rum drink was

        I’m so glad that I found this place! It has a great dining atmosphere
        and the food are excellent! My favorites are the tuna taco and mango
        salads. Their sushi are freshly made and I love the special sauces that
        came with it. Karma made Asian food very innovative which gave me a fun
        dining experience. In addition, I recommend to try out their cocktail
        menu and I think it’s great to grab a drink with friends and chill in
        there. Great food, great service, will come back again!

        Best lobster udon I've ever had. It's a beast of a dish.

        Servers were helpful, but the very long wait before anyone came to take
        our order was disproportional to the half empty state of the venue.

        Asian restaurant in Concord across the street from the train station.
        The restaurant is medium sized with a large bar area, an additional
        sushi bar, and an area of tables. We came at 5pm on a Saturday and the
        bar was pretty full but the tables were empty. They were doing a booming
        takeout business, and there were six guys preparing sushi. I had Lemon
        Basil Maki which was delicious. Service was fast and friendly. This is
        very different from Karma Burlington, there is no indication that they
        are related.
