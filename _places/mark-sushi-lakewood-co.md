        Had an absolutely wonderful experience from the start.  Plenty of room
        to sit.  Very pleasant, calm, warm, inviting atmosphere.  Service was
        quick and the waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable.  We ordered
        the sushi, which was visually presented as if it was a five-star
        restaurant.  Sushi rolls were much bigger than expected with high
        quality ingredients.  We were even treated to a special surprise sushi
        treat at the end of our meal, which was completely unexpected.  I can
        happily say that this was among the best sushi restaurants that we've
        ever been into!

        TL:DR- with all the other options in the mall skip this one.


        I've eaten here twice now. First time I ordered 2 bento boxes they
        seemed confused when I asked to go but got it all correct, they included
        a miso soup, a  salad, and our meals.

        The servers always seem confused when you ask to go doesn't matter who.

        Me and my partner walk in and said "we need a bento box to go" clearly.
        After about 10 minutes she asked if I wanted miso soup or anything that
        comes with the box, I said miso, she brought out my soup like wanted to
        eat it there when I clearly said "to go". I reminded her "this is to go
        right?" I wish I'd have taken a picture of her confusion and complete
        oblivious realization.


        After wrongly serving me the miso at the store they didn't include one
        in my actual to go order. I'm very upset that I wasn't given everything
        because your server served me wrong.

        I understand a growing business has hiccups, I won't be back to this
        one, when I frequent the mall they have like 20 different foods around
        within visual distance. On a day like black Friday when it was only me
        and my partner the only people in the eatery and it took 30 minutes to
        receive Our incorrect bento boxes.

        The cherry on top tho, after the entire situation I did not get an
        apology, did not get a price cut further, did nothing and straight up
        ignored it. Poor poor experience.

        *Edit- pics of ok food and opinion

        I have been struggling to find a good sushi spot after moving back here
        from the West Coast. Mark’s hits the spot! I eat here once a week,
        during my lunch break. My co workers all crave Mark’s sushi too ! The
        sushi chef Ko Ko is amazing!  The sushi is art and tastes delicious and
        fresh. I love the daily specials for lunch. Such kind and friendly
        people.

        Located immediately as you enter Gate #5, Mark Sushi is as authentic as
        they are delicious.  Their Miso soup is mildly flavored, while their
        special rolls have bold and familiar taste to them.  Their shrimp
        tempura was perfectly fried - crunchy outside with real firm shrimps
        inside.  I'd recommend this restaurant to any who wants to try the
        newest and only Sushi joint in Colorado Mills Mall.
