        Food and service were pretty good. I simply cannot give it five stars
        because the portions and quality did not quite match the price point
        charged. Each dish seemed to be overpriced by about $5-$7. I likely
        won't return as there are many other comparable quality options that are
        more affordable, or similar price points that are higher quality and/or
        offer bigger portions.

        We placed a car side to go order on Thanksgiving for pickup at 3:00P.M.
        We arrived, texted to let them know. No response was received by the
        restaurant. After a few minutes of no response, I go inside the
        restaurant to get the order. The order Was nowhere to be found. The
        employee nor the manager could find the order. The manager had them make
        the food and said she threw in another pumpkin pie (we ordered one slice
        of pie with our order) since we had to wait. I’ve included the receipt
        along with the time we actually received our order on Thanksgiving (yes
        I am just now getting time to be able to write this review). The food
        was actually delicious! The service was terrible. There was no text back
        for car side service so I had to go inside to get my order, which wasn’t
        ready well past the time for pickup, then the manager assumed we wanted
        an extra piece of a pie that was ordered. We didn’t. She could have
        asked what she could do for us that would actually be beneficial. We
        ordered only one piece for a reason….. Just not a good experience on
        Thanksgiving.

        Rick was one of the absolute best servers I've ever had in my whole
        life. Great food great drink recommendations. Perfect medium rare cook
        on the ny strip steak. Best food in clay terrace hands down, maybe even
        the entire North side.

        Zac was our waiter and he did a fantastic job. Drinks were never empty.
        He was very attentive and polite. He made sure that we were enjoying the
        food. The manager also checked to make sure my fiance's steak was to his
        liking. We had the $39 special per person. My fiance loved his newyork
        strip and potatoes and salad, along with his cheesecake for desert. The
        wine also came.withthe special. This was a great deal! Meanwhile I had
        the California sushi roll, and asian salad. The moscato wine was
        delicious. Great first time! We will be back.
