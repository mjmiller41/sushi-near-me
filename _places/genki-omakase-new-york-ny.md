        Genki Omakase is a famous Omakase place located right outside of NYU and
        Washington Square Park, serving a 15 piece course for a great price.


        The staff are excellent, with them observant at every turn, refilling
        waters when needed, asking for any extra pieces needed, and more. They
        provide free hand wipes throughout the meal, and are able to explain the
        dishes well.


        The courses were excellent. A favorite piece was the salmon, with a
        decent fish to rice ratio, though maybe smaller than other places. For
        the price though, I think it is well worth it. The A5 Wagyu was very
        good, the slice of wagyu they used had a great marbling and was cooked
        to perfection. They didn't have 1 of the pieces when we went, but they
        were able to substitute it for something else which was tasty as well,
        and didn't ruin the experience. the pieces were served with a dash of
        soy sauce and wasabi, however wasabi was able to be customized to be
        less or more depending on preference.


        Overall a 10/10 experience.

      text: "Best-value omakase I’ve had in the U.S.—$89 pp, done in under 45 minutes. Easily beats most of the sub-$150 omakase experiences.\n\nRecently visited for a Sunday lunch. Given the sparse crowd of only two groups during peak lunch hours, I was initially uncertain. However, once everyone was seated, the chef began without delay, and 15 course experience turned out to be great.\n\nThroughout the meal, there wren’t many noticeable compromises in sushi quality, aside from the salmon and akami. The menu still featured coveted indulgences like uni, Otoro with caviar, and Botan Ebi topped with uni. Yet the real highlights for me were the opening trio:\_ kanpachi,\_ Kumamoto oysters, and the black cod. I also appreciated their minimal use of toppings, which allowed the rich nuances of each fish's oil to shine through.\n\nFor its price, pace, and some premium touches, this omakase felt like an absolute steal. No over-the-top aesthetic plates or fancy cups—just good quality sushi, pure and simple."

        Non-descript sushi restaurant with a good omakase menu at decent value.
        Not much interaction with the chef or backstory to the menu but you get
        your sushi flavors and head on out pretty quickly.

        While the service and food quality are good, I find myself in a
        fast-food omakase experience. Typically, an omakase dinner lasts
        approximately two hours. However, here, I sense a rushed pace,
        suggesting that the establishment prioritizes accommodating a larger
        number of customers.

        Genki Omakase is an impressive sushi restaurant where the freshness of
        the ingredients truly shines, and every bite reflects the chef’s
        attention to detail. A special shoutout to Chef Chen, who not only
        showcases exceptional skills in crafting sushi with perfect texture and
        flavor but also warmly interacts with guests, explaining the highlights
        of each dish. This adds an extra layer of enjoyment and cultural
        appreciation to the dining experience. The cozy ambiance and seating
        arrangement allow you to watch the sushi-making process up close. Highly
        recommended for sushi lovers!
