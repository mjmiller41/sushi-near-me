        This was the worst sushi we have ever had.  The tuna had gristle
        throughout that was not chewable. The seaweed was dry and overall the
        entire roll dy and tasteless. The 2nd roll was tasteless but edible.  I
        will say the lady at the front was very nice and professional as was the
        manager that came out to talk to us.  He immediately called the owner
        who walked him through the refund.  So service and recovery was
        excellent.  Food was awful.

        We stumbled upon this place on our camping trip. The food was just
        enough to fill us up and not too heavy.  There was a few out door tables
        where we were able sit with our furbabies.

        This place has some fabulous flavors in their sushi! It's kept a little
        cool inside, but the front outdoor seating is great. I have to say that
        I also appreciate their branding too! Customer service is friendly and
        you don't have to wait long for your food. Small space, so don't think
        its a good spot for big groups; maybe they can expand sometime soon!

        I loved this place when it first opened. The best sushi in town. It was
        the only sushi in town back then, but so fresh and delicious.  Now the
        sushi is pitiful. The salmon that use to be a large fine cut of salmon
        is now a thin, off color piece of scrap with a fishy smell and a much to
        large rice to sushi ratio. The rolls were ok but I miss the good old
        days.

        Staff is super friendly here! I highly recommend this place if you're in
        the area and want sushi. You can customize almost anything you want
        here! I live out of town and I would definitely be back when I come
        back. They also serve red, white, and sake here.
