        I was on a business trip from out of town and was not looking for fast
        food. So I stumbled upon this healthier place. The food was phenomenal.
        They had several chili options on the side. The service was exceptional.
        You are seated and assigned a server. The ambiance was elegant, I did
        not expect this from the outside looking in. I suggest you visit with a
        larger group so you can share a variety of their portions. I will be
        back on my next trip, I definitely recommend it.

        Food especially sushi is always great and fresh we love it. We’ve been
        coming here lots of times but this time I have to do review cause enough
        is enough with the service they providing.

        Food comes out before they serve plates on the table. Order is always
        messed up and comes out in waves in parts. You have to constantly ask to
        remove entry plates, to clean the table, and ask for soy sauce (soy
        sauce should be on the table). (a lady) waitress barely understands what
        you ask for and whenever she brings something she has a face like she’s
        doing a favor (this is your job and hence it is not pleasant to eat when
        you are surrounded by  negative feelings/people) Today I left $25 tip on
        $177 bill. They were very not happy and they expressed this on their
        faces with a fake smile to ensure we see it. I smiled back and said good
        luck.

        Well good for them. Maybe it’s time to learn and hopefully management
        sees this. Pls fix your service. Your food and place is great but
        service is really bad. I wish I can give 5 stars but I’ve been here
        multiple times and service is always really bad.

        Jazmine is a somewhat unique experience in that it is both a Chinese and
        sushi spot. I've not taken the opportunity to partake in the sushi but
        the Chinese restaurant is a solid bet.

        The Peking Duck with Lotus Rolls and Plum sauce is pretty legit. Many of
        the dishes fall into the kind of greasy category so prepare yourself for
        a heavier meal.

        Overall the atmosphere is usually on the quiet end and fairly nicely
        decorating. Definitely an appropriate stop for a lunch with co-workers
        with a menu broad enough to suit most tastes.

        Discovered this place by accident when I was working in town before
        COVID. Had some of the best wonton soup I've ever had and brought my
        husband to experience this restaurant. We had sizzling rice, soup,
        chicken, chow, fun, and mixed vegetables and absolutely everything was
        delicious. Our waiter was very helpful and checked on us without being
        obtrusive and we really enjoyed our meal!

        Love the fact that they serve Chinese and sushi. Both are reasonable
        priced as well. Huge pot stickers! It's just not as crispy as I would
        like. Still delicious either way!
