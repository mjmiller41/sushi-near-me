        Came here for brunch on a whim and was blown away. Service was efficient
        (our server had 4 tables in the first 5 minutes of the restaurant
        opening and handled all equally well..yes, I'm nosy). I love the
        ambiance..lots of wood and natural plants. The brunch menu has a happy
        hour option before 12pm, so we selected from there. It's still pricy but
        it's not 2025-pricy. The food was AMAZING. Razor thin potato slices
        stacked and fried, crab cake Benedict and smoked bacon with fresh
        greens. Oh..my goodness. I've been getting bored by American breakfast
        but this woke me right up ! We'll definitely be back!

        Dined here for the first time last week and loved it. We ordered the
        Sticky Korean Ribs (on the New & Notable menu for Dec ‘24), the Birria
        Tacos and the Nashville Crispy Chicken Sandwich. I also ordered the
        Paloma Rosa cocktail and I enjoyed it!


        Everything was DELICIOUS and the ribs were especially tasty; our
        waitress recommended them to us and we were so glad she did.


        I didn’t get the best pictures of the restaurant because it’s quite dark
        at night, but it has a nice, swanky vibe and is very spacious.


        Total for two including all that we ordered plus tip was ~$100.

        Decided to stop by around lunchtime.  It's in a nice place, right by the
        shops and in the center of everything in Bellevue. The ambience was
        lovely, and the interior was beautiful. Our server was very friendly and
        attentive. Food was just alright. My bf really wanted brunch and was
        less than satisfied with his omelette, he said it seemed like they
        rushed it, and some vegetables were not cooked all the way inside his
        omelette. My sesame bowl with ahi tuna was pretty good, but had too much
        citrus dressing. Otherwise a good experience.

        I recently dined at Earls Kitchen + Bar and was impressed by the amazing
        ambience and music. I ordered the 14oz Ribeye/Wagyu Sushi for $68.50,
        and while the sushi part was absolutely delicious, I was not a fan of
        the sauce on the ribeye. However, I didn't want to inconvenience the
        staff by asking for a remake. My friend ordered the Tomahawk, but was
        mistakenly served a fish dish instead. Despite the mix-up, we decided
        not to wait for a replacement so our food wouldn't get cold. Our server,
        Rachel, was exceptionally friendly and made our dining experience better
        with her constant smile.


        Towards the end of our meal, we requested the check and had to wait a
        considerable amount of time. Understandably, the restaurant was busy,
        our server was occupied, and assistance seemed to be needed. This delay
        made us late for other commitments. Moreover, we were automatically
        charged a 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more, and additional tip was
        requested. While we typically tip generously, the extra solicitation
        felt unnecessary.


        Overall, the food was good and the service was commendable.
