        My family and I were extremely disappointed.  The food quality was very
        poor. We ordered calamari for an appetizer. You could not even chew
        them. The fried pickles were good. We ordered the family seafood meal.
        The crayfish were not cleaned. The corn on the cob was rancid. The
        sausage was the poorest quality I have ever seen in a restaurant. It
        reminded us of hot dogs. The shrimp and the few crab legs were good.
        Potatoes were also tasty. I will not be back. The server was nice and
        pleasant.

        I believe it was the owner or manager? Couldn't tell. But he was very
        friendly, seems like he loves kids, he gave my son a toy to play with,
        also at the end of our leaving, he wanted to hold our son and gave our
        son a stuffed panda.


        Such a friendly service felt very welcomed, food was fast, hot and
        delicious, and I will try seafood next time! The environment and
        everything were different and very clean! Kid friendly!

        Came in after a long day of work and had a delicious Mai Tai and some
        wonderful hot food. Such a relaxing atmosphere and my server Brittany
        took exceptional care of me. Quick and friendly service, even when they
        were close to closing. This place is a must try! Will be visiting again!

        Do the deceiving thing about this place is when we went there was only
        like two cars in the Parking lot and the outside of the place is dinghy
        and doesn't look that nice, but when you walk in it's a completely
        different story! It was a neat design inside and really clean! Now when
        it comes to service, it wasn't the best but it was some what friendly.
        The food option is pretty awesome and has a large selection! They have
        everything seafood you could want! I went with the gator bite for an
        appetizer and it was delicious! My main course was the ocean #4 and it
        comes with snow crab, shrimp, and green muscles, cooked with potatoes
        and corn in a Cajun boil! But man talk about delicious! it was the best
        shrimp I've pry ever eaten! My buddy got the catfish basket and that was
        pretty awesome too! Be

        prepared to get pretty messy while eating!

        I will definitely be back to this place

        I travel 36 miles 2-3 times a month for their Shrimp Seafood Boil.
        Headless shrimp, potatoes, corn in Cajun spicy Garlic sauce. It’s to die
        for!!! I love this place for dine-in or take out. My Boil is still hot
        after traveling home. The atmosphere is great. Large spacious seating,
        booths. You are not sitting on top of other patrons. It’s colorful and
        cool! Fresh Sushi made on the spot. The staff are friendly, efficient
        and knowledgeable of the menu. By far this is the best Seafood spot
        within 50 miles! Great for med-large groups. Parking plentiful. No
        reservations required. I dined in for my anniversary to review service.
        Fast seating on a Monday evening. The waitstaff somewhat too eager for
        ordering. Alcohol/Beer list is slim. No IPA for hubby!! My Ocean 2 was
        good, lacked sauce and required longer boil. Calamari and fried oysters
        delicious.
