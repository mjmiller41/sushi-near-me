        It's okay for being the only easily accesible poke shop in town.


        I mean, we keep coming back so it's obviously not terrible but it's also
        extremely inconsistent. I actually held off on writing this review until
        our after our fourth visit to make a fair judgement.


        Yo Poke is a good option if you're looking for a quick and easy meal.
        The quality of the fish is on the mid-level of good and the ingredients
        are typically fresh. As for the store itself, it's kept very clean and
        there are a several tables and chairs if you choose to sit and eat.


        We've visited on a few occasions now and the staff has been friendly
        every single time. The biggest problem lies in consistency. On two out
        of four visits, we received poke bowls that were so sad looking with 6
        or 7 little cubes of fish. On the other two visits, we were served a
        portion that looks like most other restaurants offer. (I've been BYO
        poke restaurants in several states).


        At this point, we watch the person building our bowls getting a tiny
        half scoop of protein, usually fish, or a full one. It's very
        interesting to me how the servings can come out so different even though
        they literally use the same scooper...just fill that tiny little thing
        up and let's call it a day. To be honest, a full scoop versus a half
        scoop usually determines a generous tip or a "this is just to be nice"
        one.


        The food itself is usually pretty tasty, no complaints on that front.


        Here is one of my favorite BYO combos:

        + Sushi Rice

        + Proteins: Tuna & Salmon

        + Mix-ins: White & Green Onions.

        + Sauces: Shoyu & Wasabi Mayo.

        + Sides: Edamame, Surimi Salad, Ginger & Avocado

        + Toppings: Sesame Oil, Tempura Flakes & Furikake


        If you try it, let me know what you think!


        Oh, one more thing! Don't try to order from GrubHub. I've tried to order
        delivery 3 times and my order was delayed by more than 2 hours every
        single time before it got canceled!

        It's okay for being the only easily accesible poke shop in town.


        I mean, we keep coming back so it's obviously not terrible but it's also
        extremely inconsistent. I actually held off on writing this review until
        our after our fourth visit to make a fair judgement.


        Yo Poke is a good option if you're looking for a quick and easy meal.
        The quality of the fish is on the mid-level of good and the ingredients
        are typically fresh. As for the store itself, it's kept very clean and
        there are a several tables and chairs if you choose to sit and eat.


        We've visited on a few occasions now and the staff has been friendly
        every single time. The biggest problem lies in consistency. On two out
        of four visits, we received poke bowls that were so sad looking with 6
        or 7 little cubes of fish. On the other two visits, we were served a
        portion that looks like most other restaurants offer. (I've been BYO
        poke restaurants in several states).


        At this point, we watch the person building our bowls getting a tiny
        half scoop of protein, usually fish, or a full one. It's very
        interesting to me how the servings can come out so different even though
        they literally use the same scooper...just fill that tiny little thing
        up and let's call it a day. To be honest, a full scoop versus a half
        scoop usually determines a generous tip or a "this is just to be nice"
        one.

        I started digging in right when I got it so excuse the half eaten bowl
        picture. Guy was really helpful and when I questioned the eel sauce a
        kid behind me said “it’s really good” eyes wide open and said he puts
        extra. So I got some. I was recommended the half white rice with salad
        and spicy salmon because I like spicy. Went down the line got basically
        everything beside quac. And long story short. 5 stars, atmosphere and
        food was on perfect. Recommendations and knowledge were great. I’ll be
        back next time I come through Bozeman!

        Ordered takeout, and my poke nachos were very flavorful and the chips
        were crunchy! Good healthy option for a quick meal that will fill you
        up!

        The staff working was unhelpful and didn’t say a word the entire time my
        family and I were waiting to be helped. When they began preparing our
        food, I had to ask the staff member to put on clean gloves after he was
        operating the register and wiping his hands on his apron. I wouldn’t go
        back.
