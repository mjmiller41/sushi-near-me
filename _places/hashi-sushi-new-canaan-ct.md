        I never write reviews, but I’ve also never had service like this. I made
        a reservation here for a special night out with my kids. We waited a
        while to get seated and again for our food, but were very understanding
        when the waitstaff kept apologizing. After dinner, the kids were really
        looking forward to dessert after seeing it at the table next to us. But
        suddenly, we were brought the check without asking for it. When I asked
        if the kids could order dessert instead, they told us no because there
        was a large family waiting for our table. It was really disappointing
        since we had a reservation, had only been there an hour, and had been
        waiting on them for our food most of that time. We’ve been going there
        for years, but won’t be going back after the rude service we had
        tonight.

        We went here for our anniversary. We ordered the love boat and some
        saki. We sat outside and the service was excellent. Food took a bit long
        to come out but it was very good. We ordered the love boat, edamame, and
        saki.

        Who doesn’t enjoy warm raw fish? Would you like a blood line or a
        sloppily cut piece of fish? Low quality food at slightly higher prices,
        but with a wait time that will make you wish your estate planner
        included it in your will. I’ve now ordered from here 3 times, once
        cancelling a pickup order after 2h waiting, and twice getting the food
        2ish hours after ordering via delivery services where the driver waited
        for at least 30m. Disappointing.
