        I recently went to Yummy Sushi, and I can't say enough good things about
        this little gem! As a small family-owned and operated restaurant, they
        truly provide a warm and inviting atmosphere that makes you feel right
        at home.


        The sushi here is fantastic—each roll is fresh, flavorful, and
        beautifully presented. You can tell that they take pride in their craft;
        the ingredients are top-notch, and the combinations are both creative
        and delicious. I especially loved their signature rolls, which are
        unique and packed with flavor.


        What really impressed me was the value. For the quality of sushi you
        get, the prices are incredibly reasonable. It’s refreshing to find a
        place that prioritizes both taste and affordability.


        The staff is friendly and attentive, making sure you have everything you
        need throughout your meal. Yummy Sushi is a must-visit. I’ll definitely
        be returning soon!

        I'm a fan of spots such as Yummy's. Owners are there and the staff are
        invested in the food and performance.  They are obviously very
        passionate about a good product.  If you are lucky on a hectic  day
        sometimes you can listen in on some of the chatter from the mysterious
        kitchen in the back.  Regardless the food is more than consistent and
        the plates all seem to be double checked and then some before heading
        out.  I am a difficult person and don't gravitate towards the sushi, but
        could almost live on what the back kitchen makes in chicken, beef,  and
        the Salmon. Chicken Katui is for the folks who like crispy for sure. I
        have not had the Pan Fry yet, and I know it's not batch made as a famous
        Chinese Woman who hardly speaks prepares those magical offerings no
        matter what I am told. ( Again, key word = passion😉)  I do want to be
        fair and point out much to my chagrin there aren't any desserts or
        treats to celebrate after such a good meal, alas, I shouldn't need it. 
        I do plenty of that in order to keep my Holiday weight + 15 to keep my
        spirits high. So should you.  Cheers, JB
