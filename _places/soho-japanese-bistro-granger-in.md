        Our chef was awesome! There is just something about hibachi fried rice,
        and this place did not disappoint.  I got the chicken and scallops, and
        my husband got the filet mignon and shrimp. All of it was delicious. 
        The mushroom soup was so good that I could have eaten multiple bowls of
        it. The salad was good as well. We didn't care for the calamari at all.
        I ordered the Mob Lobster roll, and I  wasn't a fan. My husband ordered
        the Dynamite roll he loved it. My sister and her husband ordered the
        sushi cake, I didn't try it, but they said it was delicious.

        The chef asked if we wanted the egg sauce, and we all said yes. I
        wouldn't get it again. It wasn't bad, but I just wouldn't get it again. 
        My husband and brother in law loved it. They also ordered the spring
        rolls, and I had 6 it was so good.

        I had an amazing experience at this soho Japanese bistro! The service
        was outstanding—our server, Ling, was absolutely fantastic. She gave
        excellent recommendations, made sure we were comfortable, and truly went
        above and beyond to make our visit special. The food was delicious, and
        the atmosphere was warm and inviting. This is definitely a place I’ll be
        returning to. Highly recommend!

        Man this place was awesome! I love the Udon soup, it was a huge serving
        and tasted wonderful, especially on a cold 15 degree day in winter! My
        husband had chicken teppanyaki with fried rice. He said it was moist and
        grilled perfectly.

        Went here for lunch and had a great experience. We did the hibachi
        option and had some sushi as appetizers. The service was good and the
        chef was good. This place also has the egg yolk sauce Wich is my
        favorite. The options are great if you’re a vegetarians or meat eater.
        Good time for the family as well. They have a small koi “pond”. The
        salad was very tasty as well as the broth soup.

        I fell for this place instantly after seeing fresh flowers in each
        tables . Very clean & decently decorated. Will give you a classic
        Japanese vibe .

        We ordered Shrimp dumplings as appetizer; omm it was good . I took Yaki
        soba with Shrimp ; I didn’t like it that much . My husband took red
        snapper with fried rice ; fish was good with decent portion & the rice
        was just okay .

        I wish I could leave a 5 star since I liked the ambiance but my main
        dish went wrong .
