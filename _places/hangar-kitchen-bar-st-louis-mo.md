        Very cool place. I love the aviation inspired decor and the large
        amounts of tapas (small plates). You don’t have to settle for one entree
        and your whole group can share. The real standouts of the meal were the
        tacos pastor and the “Thats My Jam” sliders. The chocolate chip cookies
        skillet was delicious and also tapas size so order more than one. Kevin,
        our server, was attentive and had really good food suggestions when we
        couldn’t make up our minds. All in all a fabulous dining experience!

        Avery was outstanding! We came with our doggies and she was so great!
        They made them a burger patty and fries- we had the fried crab roll,
        deviled eggs and candied bacon, 22 ingredients ranch salad, cod tacos
        and scallops! Literally everything was PHENOMENAL ! Avery went above and
        beyond with her service! They even have doggie bowls for our pups!!
        Anthony the GM was very great as well! He came and greeted us and our
        doggies- sat with us and was just really an all around great dining
        experience. Absolutely will be back and to try their sister brunch spot
        Momo’s!!


        We had the Peach Bourbon Mule, Comin’ in Hot, Flower Bomb and Ginger
        Betsy- ALL perfect for a hot summer night!

        Since dining here a few months ago, it immediately became my new
        favorite and I crave it constantly lol. I can’t get enough of the
        arancini, the Korean cauliflower or the chicken amandine. I could eat
        them everyday and be extremely happy. I also love the blackberry
        margarita, it’s amazing. The vibe and atmosphere of the restaurant is
        awesome, and they’ve got patio seating.

        We found this on Open Table. It had very cool booth seating and an
        ambiance that is great for groups. We took the server's advice and
        ordered several plates to share between the 2 of us. The 21 ingredient
        ranch salad was awesome - top 3 ranch experiences of my life. The
        assorted tacos were really really good. The surf and turf sushi was good
        but I'd try a new one next time. And the deviled eggs were fun. All in
        all everything we ordered was good and we enjoyed our meal.

        Loved the vibes of this place! Super cool design and feel, plus a great
        outdoor area. The food and drinks were exceptional, along with the
        service! A little on the pricey side if you are watching the budget, but
        well worth it. Can't wait to go back!

  Buzz Around Hangar Kitchen + Bar$$$Folks really enjoy the lively atmosphere
  and creative small plates at this spot, with many highlighting the fun
  sharing-style menu that keeps things exciting. Dishes like tacos and salads
  often steal the show, praised for their bold flavors and generous portions
  that make dining out feel fresh and satisfying. The service stands out as
  friendly and helpful, adding to the relaxed vibe that pairs well with craft
  drinks and cocktails. While it's noted as a bit pricey, the overall experience
  comes across as worth it for those craving a mix of sushi and other tasty
  options. All in all, it's a solid pick for anyone hunting for the best sushi
  near me, delivering consistent good times with a positive, welcoming feel.
