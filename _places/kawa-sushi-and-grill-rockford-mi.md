        Really great dinner! Prompt service and food arrived quickly. For drinks
        enjoyed the sangria and sav blanc. For apps the gyoza and edamame with
        spice garlic were delish! Birria ramen was a large portion and friend
        said it was very good. I had the fried rice which was a large portion,
        and the pink slip roll was great. Another friend had the Cali roll and
        Lisa Lisa roll and said both were good as well. And since we were
        celebrating a birthday we received a tempura ice cream, so yummy! Three
        drinks, two apps and the entrees/rolls was just over $100, not bad!!

        We always enjoy our meal here. The place seems very clean and the staff
        all seem to care about customers. The service is speedy overall and our
        hot food was hot.

        Everything is excellent, Jessica is an awesome server! It it would be
        nice to have dimmer light in the bar area. And… the outside patio should
        be screened off from Coldwell Banker next door. Some live palm trees
        would be nice outside.

        Love it! 😊

        To start I’d like to shout out to Dylan our server for being an all
        around pleasant, upbeat and attentive server. Good service really is an
        important part of a meal and embodied all the attributes you hope for
        when going out to eat. Thank you Dylan!


        Ok so this was my second time here, the first being when they had very
        first opened and I wasn’t particularly impressed- not a  negative
        experience, just nothing that drew me back.


        My fiancé suggested we try it again since he didn’t go with me the first
        time and I’m quite happy to report it was a phenomenal idea. The house
        salad was fresh, bright and well varied in texture and composition - not
        to mention it was quite large for just a “half” portion. The bibimbap
        (which we got in the hot stone bowl but I cannot remember the term for
        that sorry!) was also very good and was about 50/50 veggies to rice
        which is a win for me because nothing is more dissatisfying than a bowl
        that’s nothing but rice. Lastly, we got the ultimate Kawa roll which is
        what really turned my opinion around since I only ordered sushi the
        first time. This roll was absolutely jammed with flavors while remaining
        very well balanced and well rolled to boot.


        Good lighting, not too loud or echoing, clean feel, comfortable seating,
        quick turn around even when it was busy and at the end of the night.


        **tonight I also found out they have a patio that overlooks the river.
        We’re not quite to nighttime patio season so we sat inside but we look
        forward to checking out that area out in the future**
