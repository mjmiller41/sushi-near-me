        Was pleasantly surprised by this Japanese restaurant!

        We stopped by during a long road trip and didn’t expect such
        high-quality food and attentive service.


        Most Japanese restaurants in Northern California—especially around the
        Bay Area—tend to follow a predictable formula: bland miso soup, dry
        overcooked salmon teriyaki, and neon green fake wasabi served with
        sashimi. But this place exceeded expectations across the board. They
        clearly pay close attention to details that most others overlook, which
        really deserves appreciation.


        The miso soup was probably the most flavorful I’ve ever had—even
        compared to places I visited in Japan. That’s impressive, considering
        miso soup is usually an afterthought, served almost like a freebie. The
        care they put into it really stood out.


        I always order salmon teriyaki (I know it’s not the most authentic
        choice, but it’s my comfort food), and after trying it at dozens of
        Japanese restaurants in Northern California, this was the first time the
        salmon wasn’t dry. It was juicy, tender, and thoughtfully prepared.


        The sashimi was another highlight—served on ice, with great flavor and
        real wasabi, which elevated the entire experience.


        If I lived in the area, I’d be here all the time. Honestly, most
        Japanese restaurants in SF or San Jose don’t match the quality of this
        one.

        I’ve had sushi hundreds if not thousands of times and let me tell you
        this is the top 3 best I have ever had. I hold it up against any sushi
        spot in the country. The freshness of the fish and uniqueness of the
        dishes. It is one of a kind and if you are in the area a must try. Trust
        Sean (the owner) and the rest will take care of itself.

        Really quaint, but great quality Japanese cuisine restaurant nestled in
        the Lathrop area. Fantastic food and great service! Would highly
        recommend. Lovely modern atmosphere and seating arrangement. Large open
        tables for couples and a bar for dining solo or with colleagues. Has
        just the right touch of modern cues while being very professional.
        Dishes are portioned modestly, just the right amount. Plating is
        excellent with dishware that accentuates and provokes emphasis on the
        food itself. The authentic wasabi option on some dishes is quite a
        creative culinary experience.

        If you pass through Lathrop, California on Interstate 5, I recommend
        stopping at this restaurant for sushi and sashimi and other Japanese
        dishes. The Hamachi (yellowtail) and otoro (tuna belly) were excellent.
        The sashimi was accompanied by fresh wasabi - loved it. Enjoyed the soft
        shelled crab, flying fish roe, and uni (sea urchin), too. Fresh uni from
        Santa Barbara. The shrimp and vegetable tempura were lightly breaded,
        hot, and crisp. We had two orders of shrimp tempura. The waiter John was
        fun to talk to. Lots of energy and lots of good recommendations.
        Excellent selection of beer and Sake. John recommended the Funaguchi
        Kikusui Sake which is un-pasteurized and undiluted. It was a perfect
        pairing with the sashimi. There were a few issues. The ginger slices
        were cut too big like the size of two of your fingers. Tables are close
        together. The restaurant is on the corner of a strip mall, so seating is
        a little tight. We wanted to chat with the owner, but he was
        preoccupied. The restaurant closed 20 minutes early, and they started
        putting chairs on top of the tables while we were still eating.
