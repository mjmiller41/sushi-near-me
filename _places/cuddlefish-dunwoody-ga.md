        We did the Temaki Tasting. I highly recommend because you can try a
        little bit of everything. I had a couple favorites in there like the
        Shrimp Katsu Temaki, Crispy Spicy Tuna Temaki, Taiwanese Chicken Nuggets
        and Crab and Scallops Temaki. The server recommended this sake because
        it’s popular. It was easy to drink but if you don’t like sweet, try
        their other options. They have an array of sake, wines, and beers that
        are displayed.


        It was a busy night as it was their soft opening so we waited a little
        and got to take a look at their menu. We were well taken care of. Our
        server recommended drinks and food which was nice!


        The atmosphere is spacious, clean, elegant. You walk in and you’ll see
        the temaki bar to the left and cafe to the right. Their lattes sound
        good but we didnt get to try them yet. Their breads are a must try! They
        have an assortment of flavors. All yummy.


        Try out Cuddlefish for a delectable meal. What a treat this was!

        Foul fish... I normally don't write bad reviews, but people can get
        really sick here.


        I was so excited to try Jason Liang's new restaurant and came for lunch
        during their soft opening. Interior and plating- beautiful; hostess and
        server- friendly and professional; food- reason for concern.


        I ordered their poke bowl because it had my favorite fish (yellow tail,
        salmon, and tuna) and I didn't want to order 5 temaki at the temaki bar.
        The poke looked cute, but when I took my first bite, it tasted
        overwhelming of sushi rice vinegar followed by some chili based sauce
        masking bad (if not already spoiled) tuna. I really hate wasting food,
        so I tried to at least eat the avocado, salmon, and yellow tail. I got
        through half and felt ill. The server was super sweet and tried to help
        me, but I just wanted to leave.


        I understand if the cuts of poke bowl are ugly cuts and maybe even the
        brown parts of salmon, but don't put food that's about to spoil into
        people's food. Really disappointed and expected better quality. Will not
        return even to their café half.

        TLDR: Pricy as heck for a “smaller than what appears on camera” food.
        Won’t be back.


        Visited yesterday in their soft opening so I’ll be criticizing softly.


        I called in for a reservation and the host did a great job and was very
        friendly and pleasant.


        Restaurant was empty at this hour and as we sat, the same server came
        back twice to ask us if other people were coming and I’ve answered him
        twice that there will be 4 people total. Seems unprofessional. He should
        know how many people based on the reservation and not ask me 2x if we
        were waiting on more people… but oh well, he is probably very new as a
        server.


        We ordered 2 appetizers, the fried tofu which was I think $14? Came with
        5 pieces of 2 inch tofus. Came to,.. $3 a piece? For tofu? lol…. Scam.
        We also ordered fried chicken. Which was just a different name for
        Taiwanese chicken nuggets. $10, not too unreasonable. But the worst part
        of this? Those 2 overpriced snacks was 40 minutes long to make for no
        reason at all considering the restaurant was empty. Had to ask the
        server 3x if it was coming instead of him letting us know how our food
        was doing. Apparently he said it is supposed to be served with our
        temaki? It’s appetizer no? Are we supposed to sit there with our waters
        for 40 minutes? This displeased me.


        My friend ordered their in-house made sake and they were out. We asked
        him about their other sake options but he did not understand what he was
        selling. Need more training for sure. Beer took him 20 minutes to grab….
        Again…. In a n empty restaurant. Never asked us if we wanted our tea hot
        or cold so they messed up on the order.


        Now let’s talk about the temaki. I think Atlanta restaurant owners just
        love scamming people with these prices. Some of the original concept of
        temaki restaurants in west coast and NYC doesn’t even charge this much
        for a 2 inch mini bites. Kazunori, which is one of the OG temaki
        restaurants charge $36 (tip included) for 5 PREMIUM hand rolls that
        includes, yellowtail, salmon, otoro, lobster, and lastly creamy
        scallops. What do I get for $32 in Cuddlefish? yellowtail, salmon ,
        shrimp tempura (cheap crap), crab scallop, and 3 think slices of
        avocados (a HUGE scam). Easy to say I will not be coming back.


        Another annoying reason would be these plastic that covers the nori… I
        get the point of trying to keep it fresh but the point of the nori is if
        you’re serving me 5 temaki at the same time like some of the other
        restaurants I’ve had it in. Waiting an hour for 2 bites of food that I
        have to push plastic out of IS NOT a good experience. Also waiting an
        hour for 5 pieces of “snacks” isn’t great. We all left very hungry and
        disappointed. Is the food good? It’s okay. Definitely wouldn’t rave
        about it. The best thing I liked from it was the crab scallop.


        The biggest turn off is prices. Atmosphere was probably the best thing
        they offer. Also manager took a while going back and forth trying to
        figure out how to check us out. Definitely need to work on their kinks.
        Service being crap is fine, but the food needs to cover that lack there
        of. Which it did not.


        Despite my review I know this place will do well, because Atlantans do
        not know the value of the food they’re eating because it’s simply the
        new “hype”.

        TLDR: Signature hand rolls were tasty. Flavors complemented each other
        well. Appetizers were great. Customer service was outstanding. Food
        service a bit slow due to busy opening week.


        My coworkers and I work at the hospital nearby and came here after our
        shift. We did not realize it was during their first week of opening.


        Food service was understandably slow as they were still getting a grip
        on things.

        Our waiter, Jimmy was friendly, calm (yet urgent), and fantastic amidst
        hungry customers. He even knew the menu and was able to describe
        anything we asked.


        The manager, Jasmine came out to apologize, checked on us frequently,
        and even helped to serve us (rare quality!). She even comped a part of
        our meal. AMAZING!!


        Overall, a phenomenal dining experience and I would come back despite
        the wait. (I did lol).
