        Best sushi I've had in NoCo. It's hard to find good sushi in a
        landlocked state, and being from a seaside state, standards are high.
        The sushi was fresh & delicious!  Lots of options for sushi on the menu.
        The spot has primarily sushi options, but there are also some other
        items on the menu like tempura, noodles, fried rice, along with a number
        of appetizers. The presentation of the sushi & sashimi was also really
        good. I loved the small boats with the dry ice for larger platters of
        sushi. The atmosphere was nice, the place was clean, and the service was
        quick and friendly on the evening we went. We ordered the Sushi platter
        2 as well as an appetizer for dining in and a Bento box that we ordered
        to go. The Thai tea was good, strong tea, and not too sweet like a lot
        of places tend to do. The decor was nice, the music playing was not too
        loud or distracting. Our waitress was very attentive. We will be back to
        try some other options on the menu. Highly recommend for sushi &
        sashimi.

        If you were to drive off the freeway, go to a strip mall, and see a
        random sushi place in northern colorado, how good do you think it would
        be?


        If you are the forever optimist you would enter telling yourself you
        found some hole in the wall that bill become your new go to place.  You
        won't write a review about it cause youndont want it to be instagrammed
        to death and want your little secret to stay in your front pocket. But
        more likely- staistically your secret and its sushi would be medicore -
        maybe even worse- and when you got the bill would be asking yourself,
        "why did I think this was a good idea?" That pretty much sums up Kobe
        sushi: a Japanese restaurant masking as a Chinese Asian all in one stop
        with a fish tank, random Asian decor,  with really average bland
        flavors... think sushi but stuff you got at MCR. Surprisingly a fair
        amount of people go there? Maybe they were like me and hoped food would
        be different than the free stuff at the hospital.


        I spent 50 bucks for sushi and tempura i could have bought at sprouts or
        whole foods - and that is not saying much if you like sushi. Just save
        yourself the time and go to in and out next door.

        friendly and attentive, and the odd musical selection makes the ambiance

        Ordered 3 rolls and a Teriyaki chicken, sesame chicken bento.

        Presentation was pretty nice, but price and taste is not great.

        Rolls ordered: Lion dance roll, Paradise roll, and dragon roll.

        Every roll was mediocre to taste, the fish used was honestly bland, low
        quality fish, the spicy tuna had no spice and barely tasted it in the
        roll.

        Most of the fish you can see at the bar had no plastic wrap on them to
        keep them fresh, or sitting on any ice.

        So the rolls came out lukewarm instead of having any chilled fish in
        them. That ruins the texture and quality when served.

        I don't know any Japanese restaurant that also didn't offer iced green
        tea or matcha tea. So I stuck to it and ordered the hot green tea.
        Again, extremely low quality green tea. Checked inside the pot and it
        was just a cheap low quality instant green tea bag.

        Barely had any green tea taste. Yes I let it brew for a while before
        tasting again, same, bland.

        Everything was about 18-20 per roll and the darn bento was almost 30.
        That's very expensive for low quality mediocre food.

        I don't mind paying well for decent quality, this isn't the place.
