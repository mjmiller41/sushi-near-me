        I had lunch on a Saturday at SUSHIDELIC for my recent work trip, and it
        was definitely an experience to remember! The restaurant’s design was
        one of a kind. The fun, quirky theme and the attention to detail really
        stood out, especially the revolving artwork at the bar—such a cool touch
        that added to the vibe.


        Since I was their first customer that day, it wasn’t busy at first,
        which gave me plenty of time to soak in the ambiance. I ordered the
        lunch special Chirashi Parfait, and wow, the presentation was so
        creative! It was unlike anything I’ve seen before, and the flavors were
        just as great as the visuals.


        Things got a bit hectic when more customers started arriving. There was
        only one server managing the front desk and taking orders, so he got
        understandably busy. He was doing his best to keep up, but I had to wave
        him down a couple of times to get his attention.


        Pricing-wise, the meals were on the higher side for the portion size,
        but when you factor in the unique experience and the creativity, I felt
        it was worth it—especially when I was in the mood for something
        different.


        Overall, I’d recommend SUSHIDELIC for its fun atmosphere and inventive
        dishes. It’s the kind of place that’s perfect for those who enjoy a
        dining experience as much as the food itself.

        Very very cool atmosphere, very very sweet waitress, very very terrible
        food. I say this with all kindness but the food bordered on inedible. We
        are people who do not leave an empty plate out of guilt. We could not
        bring ourselves to finish several dishes on the tasting menu. It
        absolutely sacrificed taste for cute aesthetic. Cocktails were ok - just
        treat it like a bar and enjoy the vibes.

        Cat themed sushi restaurant with a beautiful ambience.   Servers dressed
        like cats. Everything was pink and pretty.  Conveyor belt bar was
        unique.   Nice music playing in the background.  Great place to
        celebrate  and party. The sushi was good.  Cute place. Decent food.

        HEY PIKACHU 😺 HERE! I NEED TO TELL SOMETHING!!


        THE SUM:

        This experience was one of a kind definitely a unique experience on top
        of that everything was so colorful and the waiters and servers were very
        nice and spoke in small bits of Japanese 🍙🍡. When we went apparently
        there was a boy band that was getting catered there so it was a very
        unique experience on top of two people's birthdays with the same day of
        birth!  ITS SUPER CREATIVE PLACE IS SO COOL AESTHETICALLY


        PRICE FOR VALUE:

        Price for a full dish's technically ranges from under $25 or Over $50
        per person

        1 Main 1 Side and a Drink


        Drinks are kinda pricey for what you get so that can add on another $15+

        Expect perpetson totally to be around $60

        + if you want to experience what this place really offers then over $80+


        FOOD🍙🍡:

        The food comes on a conveyor belt the waiter if you're new will tell you
        when to grab your meal so you get the hang of it.


        The menu could be considered limited but it's definitely condensed with
        a lot of the best types of Maki and other food types and it's got group
        specials foods as well.

        Their advertisements are very unique as well so I recommend trying at
        least one appetizer if you go there


        They do provide alcohol menu

        With a decent selection


        THE SERVICE:

        There are three cats and the ladies get the dress up inspired by the
        cats which is also created for there by the pretty top tier clothes
        designer.

        The very nice, they do speak a little Japanese to you, at the door
        (WHICH WE LOVE THE MOST), if you love or are inspired by the Japanese in
        Asian cultures this place is definitely a great place to showcase that.
        Or to get immersed in.


        THE CULTURE:

        Me and my girlfriend have been studying Japanese we've also been into
        Asian cultured as we were kids. She went to school to study for the
        language and I learned all by myself from just hard work studying and
        trying to remember while I work for a while I've been learning for a
        year and a half so far and I will continue to learn for most of my life
        for sure I definitely want to be more fluent, and being able to speak to
        them in Japanese a very nice experience even though I'm still studying.
        I am very thankful to the servers and waiters for being kind with trying
        to represent ourself with Japan and Asian culture language and more!


        So five stars from us that is for sure we will be back again and I will
        give you more detailed review in the coming days


        THE PLACE SIZE:

        It's a really small but big place in terms of creativity so if you're
        going in a large group, at least larger than 3 then you should
        definitely make reservations to go there! I highly recommend
        reservations or calling to make sure that there's spots available

        This place was so fun!! The place is just dripping with personality. The
        atmosphere and decor/art made it feel like we were transported to Japan.
        The hosts and staff were all so nice and genuinely excited to be there.


        Food was colorful and avante garde. We got the sushi tower, which came
        with a wheel of sauces that were meant to be paired and experimented
        with. The food was good, but the ambiance and experience was the real
        showstopper.
