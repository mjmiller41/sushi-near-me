        It was quite a wait but we had a big party. So that was expected. Would
        have been nice to be able to make reservations. The food was good
        portions ok but still ordered extra. Which cost too much. The service
        was ok, for the driver getting a mandatory 18% because of the party size
        I feel it should have been at least 2 servers to take care of us. There
        were many times I was just waiting for refills. Don't orders were not
        given or missed on the list for the cook, but were taken off the check.
        Overall a good experience.

        Took my grandmother and 2 of my sons. We had hibachi grill. It was
        amazing from the food to the service. Everyone was inviting and
        accommodating (my grandmother is an amputy in a wheelchair).Delicious
        with huge portions. The chefs are both fun and engaging. All around
        great experience everyone couldn't of been happier.

        This is my third time here…Honestly, anything I order here is delicious
        and fresh and the service is very exceptional!!! I love the cooks they
        are very friendly and creative.


        Also, the food portions are worth the price. You must try with your
        family and friends. 😊

        If you love hibachi you will love this place!!! The food quality is
        excellent, the portions are satisfying, the price is beyond reasonable!!
        The place is always clean, the service is fast, and the servers are
        great!! I’ve been going a minimum of twice monthly for 2 years and I
        show no signs of slowing down! It feels like a family run business and
        the family works there as well. (I know a husband and wife do for sure).
        I love to see the employees interactions with each other and once they
        recognize you as a regular their interactions with you. The ginger
        dressing is the best I ever had (they even sell it by the bottle)! Even
        at capacity our wait is never long. I’m a pleased customer who shares
        with everyone the experiences I have at Nasu!!! They had one waitress
        who is no longer there, her name is Asu she was the best and her absence
        is truly felt! Nasu you rock! Please get a rewards program so I can find
        another reason to come!!!


        One more note, left overs warm up great!!!

        Absolutely beautiful atmosphere! So calm and our server, Budi, was so
        sweet and we did not have to ask for anything, he was on top of it
