        On vacation. Went for the sushi and it was very good. We have an
        excellent sushi restaurant near us in our hometown and this was not as
        good as that is, so if there was a 4.5 it is what I’d rate this.


        Service was excellent. Very attentive. Water is not filtered, in a
        vacation are we’d recommend that as a service to the customers. Not to
        have to purchase bottled water.


        There was a lot of food. Ended up not having room for one of our meals
        so took it to go. Pot stickers were very good.

        On vacation. Went for the sushi and it was very good. We have an
        excellent sushi restaurant near us in our hometown and this was not as
        good as that is, so if there was a 4.5 it is what I’d rate this.


        Service was excellent. Very attentive. Water is not filtered, in a
        vacation are we’d recommend that as a service to the customers. Not to
        have to purchase bottled water.


        There was a lot of food. Ended up not having room for one of our meals
        so took it to go. Pot stickers were very good.

        Usually I am wary of places that offer cuisine from different countries,
        but this place does it well. We ordered sushi along with galbi ribs and
        beef bulgogi and all of the food was superb. The portions were also
        great and allowed us to enjoy for lunch the next day.

        We arrived at the restaurant on a cool evening, craving something hot
        like soup or a hearty dinner. The place smelled delicious with spices,
        and it had a cozy terrace vibe. It seemed like a family business, and a
        young lady greeted us at the entrance.


        After perusing the menu, we were thrilled by its diversity. When the
        dishes arrived, it started with a variety of appetizers, including
        kimchi with cabbage, radishes, and pineapples. Alongside the Kim Chi
        soup, they offered tempura vegetables in a beautiful plate: onions, a
        piece of squid, sweet potato, and zucchini.


        My husband chose the "Jampong" soup. Imagine our surprise when we found
        in the seafood "Jampong" soup: 4 small shrimp, 3 modest mussels, and a
        few pieces of tough squid (definitely not tentacles, as the squid had an
        uneven shape).


        The service was attentive and friendly, but there's room for improvement
        in the taste and composition of the dishes, guys.

        Update 11/24 Sushi was bland and slightly burnt tasting. Not really sure
        what happened, but $130 worth of sushi should be phenomenal.


        We went here on a whim and will be going back for sure! The sushi had
        large pieces of very fresh fish, and the rolls were big, colorful, and
        absolutely delicious.

        NOTE: They're MOVING on April 22, 2023.


        Sushi is fresh, and Nigiri (pieces of fish on top of rice) have large
        portions of fish on top of rice. Was a little disappointed to see that
        ONLY the Spider Roll uses REAL crab. All other menu items use Krab
        (today's way of showing that it's imitation, and often doesn't even come
        close to the real thing. The Spider roll did have real crab, and it's
        real crab flavor was there, but a little skimpy based on the typical
        medium/large roll size.


        I've been to a number of sushi establishments that offer to substitute
        real crab for an extra couple of dollars per item. I'm removing a star
        because they don't offer this, and was kind of blindsided by the Krab
        offering initially.
