        V&A Sushi is owned and operated by a charming couple, it is named for
        their children.  We have been eating their delightfully prepared, always
        fresh sushi,  yakisoba and other Japanese treats for years, since before
        the pandemic. We order takeout regularly from them and when we dine in
        they are exceptionally friendly and the atmosphere is great. We never
        get sushi anywhere else now, you can pay three times the price in a
        boutique restaurant for substandard food and rude service but not us, in
        25 years living in Portland this is by far our favorite ever sushi
        restaurant.

        If we could rate them ten stars, we would.!

        Great (hidden) spot for some delicious sushi! The portions of sushi are
        very generous and offer great value for money sushi. The staff are
        friendly and helpful. I imagine this place could get quite busy, try to
        eat outside of the lunch/dinner rush for good service.

        We went there for a late lunch, and we were absolutely in love. My best
        friend and I had a wonderful time. The food was amazing and they were
        very kind!  They didn’t continuously come and talk , they checked in to
        see how it was tasting and just * chefs kiss* delicious,  can not wait
        to go there again !!!!  I ordered 3 rolls , The flavor was great ! And
        so was the presentation. I loved the calamari also !

        We ended up here by accident - we were looking for conveyor belt sushi.
        By the time we walked in and saw the owners and only the owners inside,
        and no belt, it was too late to walk out. That's on us.


        Would I recommend this place? No.

        Was the food good? Yes.


        I love a hole in the wall as much as the next person, but I draw the
        line at sushi. Instead of looking forward to the meal, I was worried
        about the quality and freshness of everything, something you don't want
        to think about when you're about to eat raw fish. The restaurant is
        stark and you can see into the back kitchen where inventory is stacked
        in piles. The energy savings sticker is still on the wall-mounted tv.


        It was also a real turnoff to see the original prices scratched out on
        the menus and new prices written in $2-3 higher on each item. At least
        use a permanent marker or tape to hide the original prices. That means
        for seven or so dishes, we knowingly paid $20 extra. I'm happy to pay
        more, but with the stark design and it being empty the duration of our
        meal, it felt like we were filling the gap for the lack of customers.

        Pick up order through Grub Hub was ready super fast and absolutely
        delicious. Excited to have such stellar sushi within a few minutes of
        home. Especially loved the seared bluefin nigiri, the prince roll, and
        perfectly crispy sesame balls. Highly recommend!
