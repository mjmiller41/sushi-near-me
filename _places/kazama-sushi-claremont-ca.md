        When we arrived, all the tables were taken, so we ended up sitting at
        the bar. The waiter was very attentive throughout our meal. We started
        with oysters and the dynamite appetizer. While the oysters could have
        been served a bit colder compared to other places I’ve tried, the
        dynamite appetizer was outstanding—I’ll definitely be ordering it again.


        For the main dishes, we had the popcorn lobster roll and the dinner
        sushi combo platter. Both were delicious and satisfying. The staff was
        great about keeping our water glasses full, and their overall
        attentiveness added to the experience. I’ll definitely be back,
        especially for that dynamite appetizer!

        We’ve walked by so many times over the years and there was always a line
        to wait in. Finally decided to give it a shot last Saturday afternoon
        and what a great experience it was. The sushi and food were all so
        delicious and fresh. They were busy but still attentive. We dined with
        my 3 1/2-year-old son with so much energy, and there was one woman
        server who took the time to talk and play with him whenever she would
        walk by. If any mother knows what it’s like to eat at a restaurant with
        a toddler and knows how stressful it can be, this small gesture just
        melted my heart. Can’t wait to return next time we are in town.

        This place was pretty decent! This was my first time visiting and I
        definitely give it a strong 4.5 stars and highly recommend fried chicken
        Gyoza the dynamite role, the surf and turf roll, and the spicy baked
        salmon roll. This place is kind of pricey however it’s offset by the
        really large portion sizes. We went on a Saturday evening and it was
        quite busy however the service was still acceptable. I also got free ice
        cream by leaving this Google review.

        We came 15 minutes before they closed, and they were willing to serve my
        family and I. We ordered the loveboat and other dishes, and we
        absolutely loved it. They prepared it very quickly, and were very
        friendly. Best sushi I’ve had in a long time. Definitely recommend!
