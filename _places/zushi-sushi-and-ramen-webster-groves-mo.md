        Went here for lunch because I was craving some sushi and Zushi
        definitely delivered! I was confused about the layout when I was outside
        and I thought it’ll be a small restaurant but when I walked in I was
        completely shocked to see how beautiful it was in the inside and how
        long it is. Definitely don’t judge a book by its cover😂. Our servers
        were so so nice and friendly and very attentive always serving us
        definitely felt their positive energy! The food was absolutely amazing
        I’ve always ate Sam’s club sushi and this was my first time trying
        something new and the flavor on the Salmon Nigiri and the Fuji rolls
        were amazing and service was super quick! Definitely going to keep this
        one in the arsenal to have a quick bite or when i’m craving more sushi!
        Let’s go Zushi!

        It was my first time dining here. Service was friendly and fast. The
        restaurant looks small from the outside, but roomy and has a lot of
        seatings inside.  Very chill, relaxing vibe. We ordered 4 rolls - killer
        salmon, samurai, caterpillar and eel avocado. Sushi rolls were decent
        imo. Hakata ramen was pretty good. Broth was flavorful and not too
        salty. It didn’t come with ajitama, but pork belly was given generously.
        The fried tofu was so good that I ended up ordering 2 plates. Thai milk
        tea was alright. Kinda sweet and lacking of the creaminess. I’d
        recommend the Hakata ramen and fried tofu here.

        Had a lovely dinner date here during valentines, and they had everything
        so cutely themed and the staff was working so hard. The food is delish
        as always, the teriyaki salmon + veggies are so colorful I see it in my
        dreams sometimes. Not badly priced either.

        Literally the best service and the meals were excellent! Made
        reservations to confirm a spot as it was my daughter's birthday and they
        held there end of the bargain. Very quickly addressed us and made us
        feel like family! Food was amazing and service was top end! I personally
        wanted to thank everyone for our amazing service and especially Zach or
        main service provider "they all work as a team so you have many" for a
        very memorable moment for our family! Will definitely be returning and
        my picky family loved everything from the service to the food! Must try
        if you have never been!
