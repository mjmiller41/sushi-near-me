        -The quality of the fish is very good and tasty. They know how to
        combine and play with the ingredients

        - the price is too expensive for what you get

        - the service is average. Our server is very friendly. However, we
        arrived a bit early for our appointment, the server told us to wait for
        10-15 min for them to get a table ready since the customers at that
        table about to pay.We waited for more than 30 min outside, watching new
        customers came in and out. The server knew we were waiting outside at
        the door. Then we went inside just to see why they took new customers
        and saw there were multiple empty tables. It's quite weird when they
        have available tables and still let us wait outside. It took us a while
        to get the server attention at the door and also at dining.

        We had such a great experience—Zoe went above and beyond in helping us
        choose the perfect handrolls. Her recommendations were spot on, and she
        made the whole experience even more enjoyable. The food was incredible,
        especially the Uni with ikura, which was a standout. The atmosphere was
        welcoming and lively, and we’re already looking forward to coming back.
        Hoping to be served by Zoe again next time!

        Some really good Sushi here.  I enjoyed the presentation and flavor on
        pretty much all of our rolls. There were a few I wasn't a fan of, but
        that's a preference thing, I could still appreciate them and they were
        fresh and flavorful.  We did end up ordering pretty much 1 of every
        roll, so it wasn't cheap, but it was a great night out.  Standout for us
        was the Black Cod and the Snow Crab.  Drink menu was decent, my wife
        liked both her cocktails and I was happy with the Fieldwork IPA on
        draft.

        I made a reservation for Yonsei Handrolls at 6:30 PM. It's crucial to
        book in advance as getting a seat without a reservation is extremely
        difficult. The restaurant is located in an area that might be considered
        somewhat rundown, so it's important to park in a safe spot.


        Upon arrival, I noticed that there were two servers working inside,
        which was great because they were quite attentive and responsive
        throughout our meal. The restaurant has a dark and cozy ambiance, which
        creates a unique dining atmosphere. The setup is simple yet effective,
        contributing to an intimate dining experience.


        For our meal, we opted for the BALLER set, which offered a variety of
        rolls. We decided to swap out the uni due to its high cost—an additional
        $8 on top of the $57 set price. Instead, we chose two different rolls
        from the menu. Among the rolls we tried, the toro roll was the standout,
        offering a delicious and memorable taste.


        Overall, Yonsei Handrolls met my expectations. The attentive service,
        unique ambiance, and quality of the food made for a satisfying dining
        experience. If you're planning to visit, I highly recommend making a
        reservation and being mindful of parking in a safe area.
