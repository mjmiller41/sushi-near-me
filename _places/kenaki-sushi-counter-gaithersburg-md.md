        For us this was a great find.  It's the best sushi joint I've visited in
        Montgomery County yet.  The Chef's Choice sashimi sampler is a must have
        item.  The waitress gave really good recommendations, among which the
        White Tiger sushi roll was my favorite.  Portions are generous.  Flavors
        were satisfying - yes, each sushi roll had a distinctive and great
        taste, not something most sushi places can say.  You can tell they have
        real sushi chefs working with real ingredients in the kitchen.


        Small foot print but tastefully outfitted with a relaxing feel.  Last
        but not least, super clean restroom.  All in all, I can't recommend it
        highly enough, especially given one has to pay $15+ for Five Guys these
        days.

        Montgomery County yet.  The Chef's Choice sashimi sampler is a must have
        item.  The waitress gave really good recommendations, among which the
        White Tiger sushi roll was my favorite.  Portions are generous.  Flavors
        were satisfying - yes, each sushi roll had a distinctive and great
        taste, not something most sushi places can say.  You can tell they have
        real sushi chefs working with real ingredients in the kitchen.


        Small foot print but tastefully outfitted with a relaxing feel.  Last
        but not least, super clean restroom.  All in all, I can't recommend it
        highly enough, especially given one has to pay $15+ for Five Guys these
        days.

        Dining at this gem is always a delightful experience, consistently
        hitting the mark no matter when you visit. The welcoming and friendly
        staff ensure every meal feels special, while their sushi remains
        impeccably fresh and beautifully prepared. In particular, the Black
        Magic Roll is a standout—easily one of my favorite dishes, period.


        Conveniently nestled in the heart of Kentlands, the location offers
        ample parking, making visits stress-free. Highly recommended for both
        sushi enthusiasts and casual diners alike.

        Very fresh sushi with creative maki selections and other great
        appetizers and drinks!


        There was no wait to be seated for our party of 4 during a weeknight
        evening. We got a list of monthly specials and tried some of their
        drinks and appetizers!


        I highly recommend the duroc pork belly bun (comes in an order of 1) and
        their karaage, which comes with shaved fish flakes on top as appetizers!
        Many for their specialty rolls (maki) also included eel in interesting
        combinations like with potato or plantain, so I really enjoyed trying
        those out (Kitchen Sink or Donkey Kong maki). We also tried out their
        seasonal special croissant pudding with matcha and blueberry.


        I happily enjoyed all the food we ordered and I look forward to going
        track to Kenaki again in the near future! 😋

        This was my second visit to Kenaki Sushi, and once again, the service
        was outstanding. The sushi was fresh and flavorful, and I ordered three
        rolls this time. The White Tiger roll stood out with its unique
        combination of flavors and a satisfying crunch. The Scallop roll was
        equally delicious, offering a perfect balance of taste and texture.
        However, the Blue Crab roll, while decent, didn’t quite hit the mark—it
        was missing that extra something to make it memorable.


        I also tried the Tokyo cocktail, which had a flavor profile reminiscent
        of an Old Fashioned—smooth and well-balanced. That said, the
        presentation could use a bit of refinement. A touch like clear ice and a
        cocktail pick for the cherry would have elevated the experience.


        Overall, the atmosphere is inviting, the service is attentive, and the
        sushi is top-notch. I’ll definitely be returning for another round.

        My god is this place good. KENAKI uses high quality fish with modern
        takes, so you get the quality of a high end sushi restaurant with unique
        flairs. What drew me to this place was that they serve bluefin tuna (not
        that cheap hot pink looking tuna) — we got otoro and chutoro.
        Immediately just melts away in your mouth. The quality of their fish is
        just next level. I barely had any room to finish my tekka bowl too
        because I was so excited to eat everything.


        Hamachi crudo was a great appetizer — grapefruit was slightly sweet and
        refreshing. Hamachi quality was exceptional.


        Bluefin tuna was worth every dollar. There are so many varieties to
        choose from and I can’t wait to go back and get the rest of the bluefin
        menu.


        Maki were excellent. And tekka don used chili crisp which was a nice
        touch. Desserts were so decadent.
