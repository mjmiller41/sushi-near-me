        Super tasty off the beaten path sushi place in Arcata. It’s a mom n pop
        shop atmosphere but the food is fine dining style. We both got a roll
        with salmon in it, can’t remember the names but they were both
        delicious. The Miso soup, tempura veggies and edamame are all bomb too.
        Made a mistake of ordering three sakis, they came in a nice size bottle
        with more than enough for the three of us. Portions are generous and the
        food is fresh. Got the seaweed salad this trip and it was great, nice
        roasted sesame flavor. This is now our favorite place to get sushi in
        Arcata

        4 person meal, we ordered two pots of green tea. They charged 15$
        dollars for two small pots. When we brought this up they said oh its
        3$/person not per pot. (even with 3$/person we were overcharged). The
        waitress got very angry and defensive when we brought it up and told us
        "I gave you a discount". We informed her that even 3$/cup is
        overcharging and that the sushi restaurant right down the street charges
        1$/pot. Inside the pot you can see 1 measly bag of green tea, so
        regardless of the number of teabags you are actually charged by the
        number of people drinking the pot, how does that make sense ? Also the
        tea is not even on the menu so we unknowingly consented to this
        outrageous price. Regardless of the price of tea, the waitress was very
        rude, loud, defensive, and confrontational. As we were signing our
        receipts she came back and broached the subject all over again insisting
        that it's not her policy it's not her fault and that we can go to the
        sushi spot next time if we don't like the prices.

        My husband and I used to say this was our favorite sushi spot in town.
        We loved the mom and pop vibe and peaceful environment. This waitress
        has changed the whole atmosphere. She is loud, inattentive, and rude;
        the opposite of what a Japanese restaurant normally strives for.

        This food was so good! I took my mom here for mother's day. There was
        hardly anyone there because it was still pretty early. We got seated
        right away and our server was super cool & mellow but on top of his
        waiter game.

        We ordered the tempura basket and got it in like 5 minutes the tempura
        was perfect. Light, hot, crispy and not greasy. The portion is huge it
        can with yam, asparagus, onion, broccoli and shrimp, it was delicious.
        So we went a little overboard but everything was bomb and in good we
        went a little nuts. We had enough food for ourselves and took a bunch
        over to my son-son at work. We had the golden dragon with avocado and it
        was amazing! We also had the house special roll, the fire dragon roll
        and the three fairy tales. Everything was fresh, bright, and clean
        tasting.

        I couldn't believe the total it was very reasonable. The restaurant is
        clean, service is great, food is delicious. This is a 5 🌟 review.
