        Did not expect to have above average sushi in Logan! I throughly enjoyed
        it! One of the best Sexy Lady rolls I've ever had. The Caribbean-O roll
        was good too. Everyone at our table loved the monkey balls.

        The quality of the sushi is much better than the outer appearance of
        this place suggests. We loved the French Kiss and Crazy Boy rolls. We
        thought we ordered a Fire Ball roll but ended up getting a Fire Roll
        which was a delicious and unique surprise--it comes out in foil on a
        plate and they light plate. We looked at the menu after we got it and it
        even said "served on fire." Unexpected but yummy.

        I have been going to Takara Sushi for almost 10 years. For the quality
        of sushi, their prices are very reasonable. It is almost always busy but
        our food comes quickly every time. I've never been disappointed by
        anything I've ordered and I will continue to come here for the next 10
        years!


        Our favorite rolls are the Golden California and the Sunny Roll.

        Small shop with fast service. We came in at 9 and got it to go.


        It was confusing walking in because the sign outside seemed to say 50%
        off on all rolls because of the way it was formatted, but it was
        actually only select rolls. Should’ve read the finer print better. Any
        of their specialty rolls are full price, and at $18 a roll it is not a
        good price.


        We got a Kaleidoscope Roll, TNT, Anger Management, and Sunny Roll. Only
        the Kaleidoscope was full price. The total cost was $45 with some
        change, which also included an auto 10% gratuity added for take out.


        The TNT was the best. Nice spice to it and a good portion of soft tuna
        inside.


        The Sunny Roll was 2nd best. The mango and cream cheese were a nice,
        sweet combo that was interesting.


        Anger Management was good. The spicy mayo and flakes were the best part
        of the roll, making it a safe bet.


        The Kaleidoscope wasn’t worth it. The meat on top was bland. Not to
        mention it was the most expensive.


        All of the rolls were smaller than I was expecting, I usually find other
        places in SLC with better portions. Might be a good spot in Logan, but I
        found it overall expensive and unimpressive.
