        pricey, but the updated look of the  Japanese burrito and sashimi salad
        is still my go to...yummy.😋

        After reading revies,, I brought my wife here. My wife received a fish
        plate, and I got  the all-you-can-eat sushi. Before one of my sushi
        platters arrived, I ordered some ramen. My wife's fish, my ramen, and my
        1st sushi platel were all excellent. My wife was about done with her
        plate, and I had finished my ramen and shushi. It took me an additional
        twenty minutes to receive my final two sushi platters. To get the
        waitress to appear, I had to hold up my hand. She claimed that i had
        recieved my other plates which i have not.   We did have beverages, but
        she didn't stop by to ask how the dinner was or if we wanted anything
        else. Just let us be until I had to get her attention.   Again the food
        was great.  The service does need more attention to their customers.

        A small, unassuming sushi eatery that will blow away your expectations.

        They have an all you can eat deal for $30. That is amazing. No special
        restrictions, no nonsense. Plus, it is all good, fresh sushi.

        The service was some of the best I’ve had at any restaurant, anywhere.
        That includes five star Michelin rated restaurant. I never wanted for
        anything. The weight staff saw whenever I was done with a plate and
        cleared it away. They asked me how I enjoyed everything. They asked me
        if there was anything else they could get for me. Finally, everything
        they did was with Grace and a smile, which I truly appreciated.

        If you were in Loma Linda, California, you owe it to yourself to check
        this place out.

        This is one of your quintessential hole-in-the-wall Japanese
        restaurants. It's location is easy to miss. I actually drove past twice
        because it is so conspicuous. Parking is difficult because of how small
        the strip mall is. The food was amazing. We opted for their lunch
        specials. There are many options as far as your proteins are concerned.
        The combo comes with edamame, miso soup and salad. Quite a good deal if
        you ask me. Next time, we will try the sushi and rolls too. The sashimi
        pieces that came with my combo were nice and fresh, so I'm sure their
        sushi will not disappoint!
