        Happy we stumbled across this gem. We came for lunch on a slow Tuesday.
        We were kindly greeted at the door and sat promptly. The order was quick
        and we received really flavorful miso upon arrival. The sushi roll
        preparation wasn’t my favorite, but the scallops inside were good. Both
        my ramen and gfs udon were really good. Flavorful and good spice levels.
        The seafood was slightly tough in my ramen, but the beef in the udon was
        fantastic. Overall a really pleasant experience and a nice spot in Ann
        Arbor.

        The owner was a kind Korean lady and the kitchen was mostly Latino.
        Their food tastes decent but was definitely unauthentic and a bit
        overpriced. Katsu curry was the best in town, with a thick pork cutlet,
        but came with a price of $18. Sushi was Americanized and ok-ish. They
        provided complimentary miso soups, but those were premade and
        supermarket-quality. The lights were weirdly blue-purple and felt
        unsettling.

        Been here many a time and it never gets old. Great sushi, great service.
        It can get pretty busy at nights and it’s a small space so it’s hard to
        hear sometimes. Love the specialty rolls and the variety

        Decent food and nice staff, with a campus restaurant feel. Overall, the
        food is pretty good, although the sashimi I had was a little all over
        the board. I was also less than impressed with the Mama Satto Ramen, but
        the bao was tasty. The prices seem a bit high for the quality of food,
        and even though I knew about the 18% automatic gratuity ahead of time, I
        was still put off by it. I would much rather see higher prices on the
        menu than have an extra charge hidden on the check (labeled
        "surcharge"), with a prompt below for a tip, and no indication that the
        tip was already priced in. Just seems a bit shady to me, and although
        I'm not a fan of the tipping system in America, I don't think this is an
        improvement. In general, I think there are much better places in town
        for both sushi and ramen, and I would much rather support those places.

  Visitor Feedback Highlights$$$Folks rave about the tasty ramen and udon dishes
  at this spot, often noting the flavorful broths and solid portion sizes that
  make for a fulfilling meal. While some mention that the sushi rolls can vary
  in preparation and might not always hit the mark for authenticity, many
  appreciate the fresh ingredients and creative varieties that keep things
  exciting. Pricing gets mixed reactions, with a few feeling it's a bit steep
  for the experience, but overall, the friendly service and quick turnaround add
  to the charm. Reviewers generally enjoy the cozy vibe, even if it gets busy,
  making it a reliable choice for casual lunches or dinners in Ann Arbor's sushi
  scene.
