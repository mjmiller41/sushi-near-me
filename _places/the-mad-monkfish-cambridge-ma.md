        Excellent spot for American style sushi with some classics with some
        spunky creative rolls. Everything is presented with a little bit of
        pizzazz.

        A little pricey for what it is. But not surprised since itâ€™s in
        Cambridge. Good for a date night or a nice casual outing. Would
        recommend trying once or twice.

        They do live jazz on the side and you can hear a tiny bit of it in the
        other dining section.

        I went for their jazz + dinner evening and enjoyed it very much. The
        music was lovely. The sound was at the volume that was allowing you to
        have a conversation at the table - but it was also a "statement show"
        enough that if you come primarily for music, you'll IMO also enjoy. The
        service was swift and attentive even though they obviously had a few
        dozen people to be served at once. Solid food.

        We made reservations so that we were able to get to eat with some good
        jazz music. The atmosphere was super fun. Music extremely loud, donot
        expect to be able to talk a lot with the folks on your table when the
        music is playing. Lots of vegetarian sushiâ€™s were available which was
        awesome as we had vegetarian folks in our group. Drinks were regular
        nothing extraordinary. Pricey place because of the kind of atmosphere it
        offers. Perfect place to go if you have a celebration or want to enjoy
        jazz with your food.

        We had soups and the sushi boat. The ginger- mushroom soup was great and
        very refreshing. The sushi was very delicious.

        I came to Monkfish for the first time in 5+ years. I don't remember much
        about my two previous visits, but it seems like a good place for group
        meals and for live jazz. The ambience is great and the service is
        friendly.


        We shared the fried chive dumpling appetizer, which I thought was quite
        good. It was a little bit gooier inside than I would've liked, but
        otherwise had a great crunch and good flavor.


        The shrimp tempura udon was hands down the worst udon I've ever had in
        my life. The broth tasted like soy sauce water and the shrimp tempura
        was awful -- hard, tough, and just bad. I think the photo of the tempura
        speaks for itself. I cannot not recommend this dish enough. I don't
        think it should be on the menu.


        While the menu is very large at Monkfish and they can accommodate for a
        wide range of dietary restrictions and cuisine preferences, I think some
        things shouldn't be on the menu if they can't be executed well. If I
        came back, I would get some sushi or Thai food.
