        2 adults for dinner with 2 granddaughters. As I watched the dining room,
        I saw the same scenario playing out at table after table. Food was being
        sporadically served among the diners. Typically, the adults were being
        served while the children were left waiting for their food. This was the
        second time we encountered this happening at this restaurant. We waited
        and waited for our second granddaughter to finally get her food. It was
        served 20 mins after all other food had been served. There doesn't seem
        to be any pattern to how dinner orders are prepared and served to dinner
        patrons. Children shouldn't be made to wait for their dinner, especially
        when adults have already received their orders. Additionally, nobody
        checked back on drink refills. We also noted multiple tables get take
        home boxes because parts of their dinner orders were served so late
        after initial parts had been served.

        2 adults for dinner with 2 granddaughters. As I watched the dining room,
        I saw the same scenario playing out at table after table. Food was being
        sporadically served among the diners. Typically, the adults were being
        served while the children were left waiting for their food. This was the
        second time we encountered this happening at this restaurant. We waited
        and waited for our second granddaughter to finally get her food. It was
        served 20 mins after all other food had been served. There doesn't seem
        to be any pattern to how dinner orders are prepared and served to dinner
        patrons. Children shouldn't be made to wait for their dinner, especially
        when adults have already received their orders. Additionally, nobody
        checked back on drink refills. We also noted multiple tables get take
        home boxes because parts of their dinner orders were served so late
        after initial parts had been served.

        I really wanted to like this spot, but it missed the mark. The food
        itself was decent, nothing special but not bad either. However, the wait
        was ridiculous. We were there for two hours, and during that time, only
        one table left. Everyone else was just sitting there waiting for their
        food, while the restaurant seemed more focused on pumping out takeout
        orders than serving the people dining in. To make it worse, the staff
        was unfriendly, and the atmosphere was cold and uninviting. Definitely
        not the experience I was hoping for, and I won’t be rushing back anytime
        soon.

        We eat here frequently. The lady that runs the place is just the
        sweetest. Food is always delicious! My kids always eat the Chicken Katsu
        and I always get hibachi chicken and steak.
