        This is what happens when a bunch of dudes with no restaurant experience
        try to open a sushi restaurant. It looked like the staff had gotten into
        a soy sauce fight before we showed up; all of the napkins and
        countertops had soy sauce splattered everywhere.


        The sushi was… warm. At 5pm. Big red flag. Thankfully, no diarrhea.


        We were interrupted no fewer than 9 times by the staff, who definitely
        resembled those annoying helicopter parents who linger unnecessarily at
        their kids’s friend’s backyard birthday party.


        Man, I just can’t get over that warm sushi. So freaking weird…

        Came here on a random Tuesday. We were the only ones in this place so we
        were skeptical. Well we were very impressed to say the least. Great
        sushi, great service, great portions… to top it all off it was very very
        reasonably priced! 10/10 would come back

        Great vibe and service. I really don’t know any other way to get sushi
        than from a conveyor belt. They also can make a selection if they don’t
        have it out and they’ll make it fresh. I mean it’s the best. Me and my
        girlfriend come here all the time and we love it. Seriously this has
        been my spot since high school going on 6 years now and I won’t eat
        sushi anywhere else. The workers are so friendly and they make it a
        comfortable atmosphere every-time. I recommend this spot highly!

        Extremely disappointed. I’ve come here constantly for about 4 years now.
        Always a good experience until today. Drove from Arrowhead all the way
        here just for the food to be absolutely disgusting. The bar sushi was
        moist and cold. I bit into a roll and the rice was completely
        undercooked and hard. The Rangoon was wet, the spring roll also was wet
        and soggy. After telling my waitress she told me she can take my half
        bitten spring roll, and put it back in the deep fryer. Not only is that
        a health code violation, it’s stupid and gross. I was then told “if you
        want fresh food, order from the menu”. At that moment I felt extremely
        belittled and disrespected. I was told that I was lying about my spring
        roll, was constantly told that this is how the food always is, was told
        “we’re not busy so they’re not making the food fresh every hour” and was
        not shown any compassion for the utterly disgusting food I had just
        eaten. Literally the worst experience ever and I will most definitely
        never be back.

        Went at night time. Sushi go round or a la carte. Chose to try out the
        sushi go. Round.  $2.50 each plate, sushi wasn't stale, but didn't taste
        very fresh

        Whatevers on conveyor belt must have been made hours ago.


        Will i return? Probably not. Was it a fun experience?. Kind of, but the
        quality of food leaves something to be desired.
