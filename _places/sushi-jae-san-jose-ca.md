        Staff is polite but foods plain bad. Worst dining experience I’ve had in
        recent memory


        Rolls consist of an immense amount of fake crab, a tiny piece of raw
        fish, and doused with sticky sauces. Also keep in mind most menu items
        are +$5 compared to images on Google reviews

        The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, and I immediately noticed how clean
        and well-maintained the restaurant was—something that always makes a
        great first impression.


        The sushi was incredibly fresh, beautifully presented, and bursting with
        flavor. Every bite was a delight, from the perfectly seasoned nigiri to
        the creative rolls that were clearly made with care and attention to
        detail.


        What really stood out to me was the balance of quality and value. The
        portions were generous, and the prices were very reasonable for the
        level of freshness and taste. It’s clear that the owner and staff take
        pride in what they do, and it shows in every aspect of the dining
        experience.


        If you’re in San Jose and craving sushi, Sushi Jae is a must-visit. The
        combination of a welcoming owner, a spotless environment, and delicious,
        fresh food makes this place a standout. I’ll definitely be returning and
        recommending it to friends and family.

        Why did I come here? Bad reviews. Yes, really. Call me strange but I was
        intrigued by reports of rudeness.  I wanted to see what was happening.
        So, I ate here alone once. Then a 2nd time, then a 3rd time. And a few
        days ago, a fourth time, with a friend. EVERY TIME.... everyone here was
        so nice. Each person there was sweet, friendly, courteous and helpful.
        So... keep in mind, sometimes people can be jerks to restaurant workers,
        and when they are, and they encounter a worker who's had enough and
        isn't standing for it, unfortunately the restaurant is the one who
        endures a negative, and possibly unfair, review.

        My friend by the way says all sushi tastes pretty much the same to her.
        Ok. Fair enough. And even SHE noted with grateful surprise that this
        sushi at Sushi Jae stood out as surprisingly good. I agree. The rice and
        fish were the right temp (not refrigerator cold) and tender, fresh and
        beautiful. Oh man.

        I like the low sodium soy sauce option (which to me just tastes so much
        better) and the ice cold Asahi beer.

        So why 3 stars for Atmosphere? Not a criticism. It's just a very basic
        environment. I don't need flowers and fish tanks. I like the low,
        ambient lighting. I got the Sushi Combo (I think?). It was like 29
        bucks. Salad and soup included.

        Would I change anything ? Yeah. I'd do away with the masks. One pretty
        girl wasn't wearing one, thank G-d. And I think the entrance to the
        store could be brighter and more stylish. I honestly think it's an easy
        place to drive past. Either way, I so look forward to going back.

        Reliably delicious!  Hats off to the sushi chef who has served delicious
        sushi time after time. The rolls are well balanced-Not too much rice. 
        Chicken ramen is great here too!  Staff is friendly and it is a family
        friendly establishment.
