        Zhen Bang Noodle & Sushi is a restaurant that specializes in Japanese,
        Vietnamese, and Chinese. It can be found on the casino level of Ocean
        Casino Resort across from Wahlburgers.


        During my stay at Ocean this past June, I was craving noodles so I had
        to hit up Zhen Bang. This time around I got to try the Shrimp Pad Thai,
        and It was delicious. It packed alot more flavor than the Seafood Pan
        Fried Noodle.


        Service wasn't great this time around. The host was unwelcoming and our
        server wasn't able to be attentive because he was too busy.


        Takeout is available but there is no delivery.

        I had an unpleasant and unprofessional experience recently on Tuesday
        night 9/10/2024 around 8-9pm. I don’t know the name of the host but it
        was very unprofessional and I felt discriminated and uncomfortable.
        First of all, I love this restaurant and I am a regular there which I
        often came to AC twice a month or more and this is a must stop by place.
        All the waiters were hardworking and super friendly, i understand during
        busy time they are busy running around and wait time maybe a big long
        but I really appreciate their service and the food and I always tip them
        well. The host I recently encountered was very unprofessional I don’t
        know she is treating me this way due to my appearance which I am Asian
        American wearing a hoodie and short pants for my comfort , I called the
        restaurant from my room which no one picked up I thought they must be
        busy to take online order so I walked in to make the take out order.
        When I walked in atmosphere was filled with a decent amount customer not
        as busy as on weekends. I caught her on her phone then I asked “hi, can
        I make a take out order? She looked up and glance at me and do u need a
        menu, I said no I know what I want. then she point at somewhere and tell
        me to go stand over there. I asked where? And she said go stand next to
        the computer pointing at the computer there and then went back to her
        phone leaning against the host cabin. I Normally dine in but I wanted to
        save the food for later and I prefer to take out this time, normally the
        host will greet customers nicely with a welcome face and guide customers
        or at least would say “can you please wait by the counter there I will
        send someone to take your order” but she was very rude pointing fingers
        Two TIMES impatiently and throw me off there; does she expect me to know
        where or how to make an order? I am paying for my food and I am not
        there to beg for free food. I felt discriminated and racist by her
        behavior. I would understand if she was busy with other customers or
        other things but she was busy on her phone and gives a poor service to
        customers who love this restaurant, that ruins Zhen Bang’s reputation. I
        was also once a host in my early age and  this is not how I would treat
        customers no matter what they are or how they look. I believe Putting
        personal things aside and performing a good work ethic is very
        important. I felt very uncomfortable and disrespected. but the waiter
        greets me well and take my order nicely, he said it would be ready in 10
        mins and I told him I will come back, I m glad he remembered me coz I
        just ate there two times last week. Eventho it is an Asian restaurant I
        am happy to see diversity in the work place and everyone is so friendly
        and hardworking. I could not stand to see the disrespectful host so I
        left and told my Indian friend to pick up the food for me. he also said
        the same thing that she was on phone and barely greet him and just
        standing where she is and pointing at the bag that’s already packed at
        the counter, he has to go and get the food bag. Normally the host would
        bring the food bag to us or at least nicely guide us where to pick up
        the food. I don’t know how many customers faced this unprofessional
        behavior and customer servicing of a host last night but as a customer
        who loves to come back to this place again in the future, I hope not to
        encounter this kinda of situation again.

        A little on the pricey side but we had a great experience. Wonderful
        service and the best lo mein I've ever had. I recommend the crab racoon,
        pork lo mein and pan seared black pepper flank steak. All
        extraordinarily seasoned and tasty!

        Wow! Delicious spot in the center of the action, steps from the casino
        floor at Ocean Casino and Resort. Zhen Bang has a varied menu of freshly
        prepared, authentic Asian food.

        We visited for a quick lunch and tried mostly dim sum. We tried two
        different sushi rolls, crab Rangoon, steamed dumplings and fried
        dumplings.

        Everything arrived quickly at our table, hot and prepared well. I really
        liked it here. I'd visit again.
