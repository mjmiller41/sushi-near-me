        Okay. So I typically try to leave as honest of reviews as I possibly
        can. I really didn't want to leave a review this time. Because I felt
        that the service was exceptional, but the restaurant itself was not. I
        felt the sushi was a bit off temperature. The crab meat didn't taste
        like it should, And the rest of the feeling in the restaurant felt a
        little bit dirty, not too much. Which leads me to my next point I was
        constantly bombarded from the time my drink hit the table by tiny little
        flies that I kept killing over and over it ruined my entire evening, as
        I tried my best to hold a smile for the hostess, as I knew she
        understood that I was probably aggravated by what I was going through? I
        tried to mention it to her, but I know there was nothing she could do
        about it, but the flies were absolutely atrocious. Even though the
        service was great, I probably will not be back. Side note: this was the
        first time I ever took myself out to eat alone as an adult, and it made
        me feel like I don't want to do it again haha also.. what's with the
        shrimp tails?? UPDATE: Got home and felt something in my teeth.. what
        was it?? One of the flies.. wow. Just.... wow..

        Solid go-to for yummy affordable lunch bento boxes like pork katsu. I
        love that it comes with a variety of tempuras, miso soup, California
        roll ans salad. I haven’t tried other dishes or the dinner bento yet but
        the pictures look delicious too.

        I love the complimentary miso and salad.


        Service was friendly and attentive.


        I wasn't a fan of the nigiri (I'm super picky), but I really liked the
        taste and quality of the teriaki.


        The pacing of the dishes was off - apps came out after the mains - but
        they also came out hot and fresh.


        The favorite dish was the fried calamari - the most tender squid I've
        ever had.


        I would recommend the cooked dishes over the fish.
