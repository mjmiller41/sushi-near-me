        This restaurant has been known and visited by us for 25 years. It's
        always delicious here and we love it. We just liked the atmosphere
        before the interior design was rebuilt, when there were tables on the
        floor and we took off our shoes and sat on cushions, putting our feet in
        the recesses in the floor. We enjoy enjoying delicious food or ordering
        from there to home.

        The first word that comes to mind is WOW! The service was outstanding,
        and the experience was made even better by the incredible food and
        atmosphere. To truly savor it all, I believe great company is a must. On
        this particular evening, I had the pleasure of being joined by my
        brothers from MRD.


        Now, about the restaurant—let me just say, the food was exceptional! The
        Pad Thai was absolutely delicious, and the fried fish quickly became the
        star of the night, sparking lively conversations at the table.


        If you haven’t visited this place yet, it’s time to try something new!
        Check it out, enjoy, and may God also be your company on your day or
        night.

        We had driven past this place so many times and kept saying we need so
        visit. We'll we finally did and we were amazed.  The atmosphere was
        inviting and really brings you to Thailand.  And the food was out of
        this world. Definitely a must visit.

        The food is good. The flavors are there! We have been twice BUT, I have
        to tell you guys we did get a little sick the last time we were there.
        We had Tom Ka, Pad Thai, & sushi... Not sure what we got sick from so
        just eat with caution. The service is okay but they are forgetful. The
        bathroom is clean.


        We will be giving this place a rest for a while though.

        DIRTY utensils… I had a food poison before here …. The food is good also
        the service …. But lately there is a lot of Asian restaurants with full
        violations about sanity and food management…. Call the city for them to
        inspect this restaurant
