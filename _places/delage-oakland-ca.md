        This is the best sushi/omakase in the Bay Area. I live in LA (and have
        tried most every sushi restaurant in the Bay and LA) but whenever I fly
        into Oakland, I always make reservations here. Chikara is a master.  You
        will not be disappointed. The sake pairing is excellent!

        Just had dinner at Delage. It was such a delicious meal with wonderful
        service and very knowledgeable chefs preparing the sushi right in front
        of us. All of the flavor combinations were creative and well-balanced,
        and the food was presented very well with the artistic bowls and plates.
        Would definitely recommend this place for a fancy night out!

        This place is a must go.


        One thing I look for in places like this is simple but unique flavors.
        The chefs here absolutely knocked it out of the park with every dish.
        The flavor combinations were incredible, the textures were spot on, and
        the plating was beautiful. The staff was really kind and helpful and the
        overall atmosphere was really laid back.


        Can't wait to come back.

        8 course omakase experience - they get their fish fresh daily and
        incorporate seasonal ingredients into the menu. The flavors were simple
        yet complex and each course had it's own surprising element. Each dish
        is prepared was thoughtful in complimenting flavor and texture! The
        nigiri was exceptional - (if eaten in the correct order) the buildup of
        complexity and umami was a delight to experience. They were also
        accommodating for our dietary restrictions. Highly recommend this place!

        Atypical. Tiny restaurant (10 seats, 6 at the counter, one table for 4)
        with a unique 7-course menu changing each week. Food is very delicate,
        essentially around fish (only one small piece with meat during the whole
        meal). I was maybe expecting something more creative, more different
        across the courses, but was still very enjoyable. Service was very
        efficient, as all guests were mostly served at the same time.
