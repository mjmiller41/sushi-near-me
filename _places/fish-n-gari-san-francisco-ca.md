        If you're looking for great sushi,  this is a place to visit. It is a
        small place with limited seating and only one chef. So if there's a lot
        of people expect the service to be slow. We had the sea urchin which was
        very fishy and ocean flavored. Be sure to ask for the price if you're
        looking to order this for it was very expensive but I felt we got a
        large amount for the money. I had the beef teriyaki bento and we thought
        the amount of beef was a little on the small side. We were the only ones
        dining in on a weekend but it seemed like they were doing a lot of
        takeout orders. If you're on Polk Street and looking for some great
        sushi, this is the place.

        I'm not a sushi expert,  have only been to Japan once,  but I am from
        New York!


        I can't compare to other SF sushi places.

        I can say,  the service here was exemplary,  attentive, without being
        pushy and when I asked for a recommendation of one roll versus another, 
        he actually gave me a recommendation,  which I took and was very
        pleased.

        Having drunk a ton of fresh green tea in Vietnam,  I'm not accustomed to
        dry green tea, but I really liked what they offered and they were kind
        enough to fetch the bag and let me take a picture. I'll find it before I
        leave California.

        I had two rolls, and they were top notch.  Had four pieces of sushi
        because I was still craving a bit of protein and wanted to check out
        their fish. Also perfect.

        I started out with edamame and was very pleased that they were obviously
        very fresh and perfectly boiled and salted with kosher salt.

        Lastly,  the large, hot sake, was hot,  but not too hot.  They obviously
        knew to keep the temperature below 180° , the point alcohol boils.  If
        only those sushi places in southern California understood that.


        All,  in all,  I simply can't see how you would be disappointed here. 
        It has a homey,  comfortable feel that makes even a New Yorker like me,
        feel at home.

        This place is awesome.  Excellent friendly customer service from the
        moment we walked in until the moment we walked out.  We loved everything
        we got--gyoza potstickers, red dragon roll, unagi, yellowtail, and
        philly.  Good priced sushi and beer.  Also, second order of hot sake is
        only $1.  Definitely making this our go to sushi joint.  I could tell
        there was a lot of return customers in there.  One lady even gave our
        server a hug on the way out !

        The worst sushi I ever had. The rice were hard and the avocados rotten.
        The udon was really weird and had a strange moldy taste to it. The
        interior is also old and dusty and untidy. Stay away!

        Extremely kind staff. Went the extra mile to separate sushi with gluten
        from the rest. I ordered several platters and they helped me walk the
        food to my place. Tom and Wendy, if you read this - thank you for a
        really great experience!!
