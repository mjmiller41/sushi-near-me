        First time here! Was planning to have pho but as I was walking to the
        restaurant, my partner and I decided to give this place a try instead.
        We got 3 different roles plus a miso soup and spicy edamame. The rolls
        that we had were Sophie Mango, Charlie Chaplin, and Spider Man. They
        were all really good but the one that stood out was Sophie Mango. The
        freshness of the mango mixed with the spicy of the jalapeño was
        delicious. Definitely will go back and trip some more good. It was very
        slow that day so we service was great.

        We tried the agedashi tofu, rainbow rolls, and a few special rolls. The
        food was decent overall, but the rolls had a bit too much rice, and the
        fish on top was sliced quite thin

        Great atmosphere. We ordered gluten free. There was a little confusion
        in the beginning which was sorted out quickly.

        Friendly staff. Great service and food.

        Uni was not available today. I am definitely coming back to eat here.
        Great food for affordable price

        I can say without hesitation that Aniki’s Sushi offers an unparalleled
        dining experience. From the moment I walked in, the attention to detail
        in the decor immediately signaled a restaurant committed to excellence.


        The food, to put it simply, was sublime. The quality of the fish was
        evident in every bite, offering a freshness and excellent flavor
        profile. The chefs have mastered the art of balancing flavors, textures,
        and presentation to create a dining experience that transcends the meal
        itself.


        To anyone seeking an authentic, high-quality sushi experience, consider
        your search over. Aniki’s Sushi isn’t just a restaurant; it’s a culinary
        revelation that you’ll want to revisit time and time again. Five stars
        simply don’t do it justice—I wholeheartedly recommend dining here.

        SF East Bay (Fremont).  We did the lunch special which is a pretty good
        deal for around $22 for a miso soup, a regular-sized roll and 3 pcs of
        nigiri.  Hubby got Enter the Dragon which was good since of course you
        can't go wrong with shrimp tempura and avo inside and unagi on the
        outside.  I got the See Through roll which was pretty unique since it
        had seaweed salad inside which amped the taste of the salmon and avo
        then it was wrapped in rice paper vs the usual seaweed wrapper.  The
        miso soup was decent and the 3 pcs of nigiri were of course the chef's
        choice which were ebi, tuna and salmon.


        What we did not like:  the wasabi was super weak as in hubby's sauce
        container was already muddy with all the wasabi he put in and he still
        did not taste any heat!  This also might be one of those very few
        Japanese restaurants that charge for hot tea since tea is usually
        complimentary.  Lastly, the roll and nigiri were placed in an oval bowl
        which was also chipped btw and made it a little hard to get to the
        roll/nigiri vs the typical flat plate which would've been much better.


        Overall, just ok and we kinda wished we chose another restaurant,
        Japanese or not, to eat at especially since we don't go to Fremont that
        much.

        miso soup was decent and the 3 pcs of nigiri were of course the chef's
        choice which were ebi, tuna and salmon.


        What we did not like:  the wasabi was super weak as in hubby's sauce
        container was already muddy with all the wasabi he put in and he still
        did not taste any heat!  This also might be one of those very few
        Japanese restaurants that charge for hot tea since tea is usually
        complimentary.  Lastly, the roll and nigiri were placed in an oval bowl
        which was also chipped btw and made it a little hard to get to the
        roll/nigiri vs the typical flat plate which would've been much better.


        Overall, just ok and we kinda wished we chose another restaurant,
        Japanese or not, to eat at especially since we don't go to Fremont that
        much.
