        We have walked past this place many times wondering how it was.  Well,
        we stopped and went in.  On a Saturday night it is recommended to get
        reservations.  We didn't have reservations but they gave us a seat at
        the Sushi bar.  It was really fun watching the Sushi Chefs TJ, Raul, and
        Kiichi creating some amazing creations.

        The Owner was working in the kitchen producing some amazing items.  We
        started off with a Tempura dish with Shrimp and fresh vegetables.  The
        vegetables actually come from the husband of the owner's farm.  It was
        very well prepared and extremely delicious. That was followed by the
        Seafood Chowder.  There were ample quantities of seafood and a fantastic
        flavor. We also had the potato filled rolls.

        Following the apps, we had three Sushi rolls, the Top Hat, the Lotus
        Blossom, and the Ocean City.  All were well prepared and very enjoyable.

        Tony and Mel were our servers and made the visit very enjoyable. This is
        definitely a place to visit if you like good sushi and a pleasant
        atmosphere.

        For sure a place I'll visit again.

        Went back again. It was fantastic. We got 4 rolls and a Shrimp Shumai. 
        So good. We like to sit at the sushi counter and watch the chefs making
        the delicious rolls.  Always a fun time and amazing food.

        We have walked past this place many times wondering how it was.  Well,
        we stopped and went in.  On a Saturday night it is recommended to get
        reservations.  We didn't have reservations but they gave us a seat at
        the Sushi bar.  It was really fun watching the Sushi Chefs TJ, Raul, and
        Kiichi creating some amazing creations.

        The Owner was working in the kitchen producing some amazing items.  We
        started off with a Tempura dish with Shrimp and fresh vegetables.  The
        vegetables actually come from the husband of the owner's farm.  It was
        very well prepared and extremely delicious. That was followed by the
        Seafood Chowder.  There were ample quantities of seafood and a fantastic
        flavor. We also had the potato filled rolls.

        Following the apps, we had three Sushi rolls, the Top Hat, the Lotus
        Blossom, and the Ocean City.  All were well prepared and very enjoyable.

        Tony and Mel were our servers and made the visit very enjoyable. This is
        definitely a place to visit if you like good sushi and a pleasant
        atmosphere.

        For sure a place I'll visit again.

        Overall:  Terrible service, mediocre food, ridiculously expensive for
        what you get, and a general waste of time and energy to eat here.


        Went in for a celebratory dinner - showed up just at opening time.  The
        hostess asked if we had a reservation (we didn't) and then proceeded to
        seat us in the back near the hallway to the restroom.  There were
        multiple open tables, including one at the front window, that remained
        empty for the entire meal. In other words, reservations don't matter
        there, so I'm not sure why they act as if they do matter.  The place was
        1/2 empty on a Friday night with a freaking street festival going on
        outside.


        We ordered gyoza, chicken teriyaki, and two different sushi rolls.  The
        gyoza was tasty - light dumpling wrapping and flavorful inside - the
        ponzu sauce wasn't really (no citrus) - it was soy sauce with chili
        oil.  The sushi came out first.  The "dragon" sushi roll was tasty and
        well made, but clearly skimped on the fish.  The other roll was supposed
        to have "seared" salmon, but it was cut so thin that it was completely
        cooked through and rubbery.


        20 minutes into the service the chicken teriyaki was still not on the
        table.  The server came by to ask if everything was okay, but didn't
        listen for an answer- she just asked in passing while walking by.  I
        could have said the kitchen was on fire and she wouldn't have paid
        attention.  We waited another 9 minutes and she came with the check and
        asked if everything was all right.  I told her I hadn't been served yet
        so she went to the kitchen and said that they were cooking it.  We asked
        to cancel the dish and were told "they've already started cooking it." 
        We took the food to go instead because at that point we were done with
        the place.  When the to-go order came I did taste the chicken so I could
        see how it was.  Dry and in need of seasoning is the answer.


        The server offered no explanation for failing to recognize that one
        person hadn't been served their entree, and certainly didn't offer to
        remove the dish, offer a discount, or even apologize.  Overall, very
        disappointing dinner.  Photo shows the "to go" order.  $21 my friends. 
        Save your money or go somewhere else, this place isn't worth it at all.

        I'd recommend going early and reserving a table. We always get the udon
        tempura. They have great sushi as well. In the picture we have 6 nigiri
        samplers merged into one plate. Probably the way to go if you're into
        nigiri.
