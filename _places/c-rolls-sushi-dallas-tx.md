        C Rolls Sushi makes awesome sushi rolls that you should try. It has been
        a favorite of mine since I discovered it about 19 years ago. Yes. It has
        been there that long. I have enjoyed watching their evolution. Believe
        it or not they have never made a bad meal in all of this time. This is
        my first review.


        I started things off with some Yellowtail and Smoked Salmon Sashimi.
        This was my first time trying yellowtail. It was interesting. It had a
        very suttle taste with a hint of lemon (that I liked. Next time I will
        request that they slice it thinner. Just my preference.


        I moved onto The Mexican Roll. Another first. It was spectacular! This
        is a cooked  roll made of crab meat, avocado, cucumber, shrimp inside,
        topped with avocado and amazu sauce. My first bite had me seeing
        fireworks because it was magically delicious. I did also order fried
        rice. It was pretty bland to me. I like to taste flavor in my fried
        rice. I would not order it again. The sushi will make you forget the
        rice lol.


        The only drawback to my meal was that the bar was out of Plum Wine. That
        is my go to drink when eating sushi. Since the food was so good, I’m
        willing to overlook it this time 😉.


        C Rolls Sushi should be on your list of restaurants to try soon. The
        staff is welcoming and their sushi and sushi rolls are top tier. The
        prices are amazing. Head on over and check them out. Don’t worry. You
        can thank me later.

        The sushi was incredible. We tried a fresh, cooked, and baked roll. All
        of them excellent quality and flavor! They had a huge variety to choose
        from and some unique rolls. We especially loved the heavenly roll and
        the Fredrick's rolls. The Cajun edamame was just good. Prices were so
        reasonable.

        Only critique is that it was freezing inside.

        Would definitely come again!

        I’ve had this sushi in house and Togo and was very happy! We enjoyed
        every roll and the freshness of the fish can’t be beat. Look forward to
        visiting a third time soon.
