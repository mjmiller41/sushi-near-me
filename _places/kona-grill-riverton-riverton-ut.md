        This place was amazing!!! Came here for dinner on a Monday night and
        everything was great. The food was delicious, well worth the price,
        ambiance/decor was great, and the staff were way cool and friendly. Both
        Marion and Coleman helped us out and they were super helpful and
        attentive to when we needed water and extra sauces etc.   I got a medium
        rare filet with lobster which was delicious and we loved the sushi as
        well. Very big menu and great staff! If you get a side, the meatballs
        are a must try!


        Looking forward to going back for a birthday this weekend!

        We came here at 1 pm on a Sunday to celebrate my oldest son’s birthday.
        At first they only gave us brunch menus but they eventually brought
        regular menus per our request. Our waiter’s name was Coleman. He was
        very nice and he seemed to be trying very hard. The problem was that we
        asked about using a Facebook coupon for a free burger and he said he
        would make it happen. However, when we were finished the manager came to
        our table and said we couldn’t use that offer because it was supposed to
        be for take out only and the computer would not let her do it. She
        didn’t seem to care about the fact that our waiter told us he would
        honor it before he took our orders. I ordered the Rocky Mountain Omelet
        because it said it included roasted red peppers. When I told the manager
        that it didn’t include any red peppers she said “corporate took those
        roasted red peppers away from us”. I told her they are listed on the
        menu, but once again she didn’t seem to care. My omelet was overcooked
        and filled with mostly onions. The rest of the food was okay but way
        overpriced for what we received. The total was $185.62 for five of us
        and four of us just had water to drink. The best items I tried were the
        Sunset sushi roll and the asparagus. This is a beautiful and nicely
        decorated restaurant with fish tanks and an awesome looking patio on an
        upper deck. However, because of the manager’s ‘I don’t care’ attitude I
        doubt I will ever return.

        Kona Grill is a hip, island-inspired eatery that truly has something for
        everyone. This was our second visit, and while everything was great, I
        gave it a 5-star rating that feels more like a solid 4.5. Let’s talk
        about it!


        We came in early on New Year’s Eve (4:30 PM) and were greeted warmly.
        The staff were all wonderful, engaging, and made us feel right at home.
        The ambiance? Simply fantastic—a great mix of chill vibes and classy
        touches.


        Now, let’s get to the food. We started with the meatball appetizer and
        then moved on to the macadamia nut chicken, the KG Burger, and a side of
        mac and cheese. Everything was plated beautifully and looked very
        inviting. While each dish tasted good, they all could have used just a
        touch more seasoning—mainly a bit more salt to really make the flavors
        pop. That said, we enjoyed every bite.


        Our server, Sierra, was absolutely awesome. She was friendly, attentive,
        and made the whole experience feel special. We had a tiny hiccup with
        the KG Burger (we requested no onions, but it arrived with them). Sierra
        noticed right away and went above and beyond by comping the burger. It
        was such a kind gesture and completely unnecessary, but it left a
        lasting impression. Thank you, Sierra!


        I would highly recommend giving Kona Grill a try. It’s perfect for a
        date night or a fun evening out with another couple (or two). You won’t
        be disappointed. :)

        Best experience EVER! Came in on a Tuesday afternoon with my family of
        6. Kids ranging from 6 weeks to 13. The staff didn’t skip a beat. They
        were so accommodating! We were greeted by Silas at the front door, and
        he was amazing. So kind and friendly, struck up a convo with my us about
        Demon Slayer because our girls were wearing their merch and that was
        just an awesome way to break the ice. The food was so delicious, our
        cups were always full, and Sara was so kind and made sure we were happy
        the entire time. It can be so nerve  racking to go out for a nice meal
        with a large family and little ones, but the way we were treated and
        cared for at Kona Grill made it the most pleasant and memorable
        experience we have had in years.
