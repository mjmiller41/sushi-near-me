        Calamari was just ok. Too much breading, chewy and small portion. Sushi
        itself was good. However, I was annoyed that my baked roll was placed in
        the same container and right next to my husbands raw roll. I
        specifically order cooked/baked because I had a kidney transplant and am
        not allowed to eat raw. At least place them in a divided container so
        they’re not touching.

        Haven't been in here for a while since we moved out of town but came
        back and really enjoyed that I could go out for some Japanese food. This
        is really spectacular


        Service was absolutely stellar. I had lots and lots of questions and I
        think all of the weight staff stopped by to answer my questions for me
        and I ended up getting the pokeball and I am really delighted with it.
        They explained to me they've got several different kind of sesame bowls
        and I like the pokey bowl. It has a really nice sauce to it and there
        were just tons of food in here just and very delightfully presented. I
        did ask for the lettuce instead of rice and they said it would be an
        upcharge of $2 which I didn't want to go for. But that would have been a
        nice addition if they would have been that the atmosphere was a lively
        there all lots of tables were full. There's a sports bar football game
        on right now. Music playing in the background. The chefs are busy at the
        sushi bar. The tea is really great. I definitely know this is one of the
        places I like to go to. So sorry my husband doesn't want to eat Japanese
        anymore. This is a real treat

        We live up in Mount Baker now and it's 100 mi trip to get down to
        Everett but I was down here today and thankful to come out of my way a
        little bit to be able to eat here.
