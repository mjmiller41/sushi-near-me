        This was a great place. We are from out of town and not knowing the area
        we weren’t sure about it. But we were pleasantly surprised that the food
        was outstanding and our waitress was exceptional our daughter wasn’t
        sure of what to order and after asking my daughter a few questions she
        recommended a fabulous roll unfortunately I don’t recall the name but
        she did say it wasn’t on the menu (it is the one on the pic) I
        absolutely recommend this great place oh and the kids fried chicken was
        really good too.

        delivery was impressive. We had three sushi rolls and dessert. We will

        Sushi Fever: A Hidden Gem for Sushi Lovers


        If you're looking for an amazing sushi experience, look no further than
        Sushi Fever! This place has quickly become my go-to spot, and for good
        reason. First off, the food is absolutely incredible. Every dish is made
        with such care, and the sushi is always fresh and bursting with flavor.
        Whether you’re a fan of traditional rolls or more inventive creations,
        Sushi Fever has something to satisfy every craving.


        The quality of the ingredients is always top-notch, and you can tell
        that they use only the freshest fish. The rolls are beautifully
        presented, and you can taste the difference in every bite. I especially
        love the variety they offer—it's hard to choose just one favorite!


        What truly sets Sushi Fever apart, though, is the staff. Amanda is
        incredibly friendly and attentive, making each visit feel special.
        Whether you're a regular or a first-timer, they always greet you with a
        smile and provide excellent service throughout your meal.


        Another standout feature is the pricing. For the quality of food you’re
        getting, the prices are more than reasonable. It's definitely an amazing
        value for the experience.


        Overall, I can't recommend Sushi Fever enough. If you’re in the mood for
        amazing sushi, and great service Sushi Fever is the place to be!

        First time trying Sushi Fever and it was delicious! Everything we had
        was really good. From the calamari (which is not your typical calamari,
        it is better) to the specialty rolls. My favorite was the Carrot Top. So
        many flavors exploding in your mouth! We also tried the spicy Hawaiian
        and I believe the sex on the beach.

        The place is small and was very busy but we will definitely be back!
