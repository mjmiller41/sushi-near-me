        My husband and my best friend surprised me with a birthday dinner here.
        I was so delighted. From finding the non descript entrance to the
        coolest music scene in a restaurant. We sat right in front of the DJ and
        the ambience was so fun! I added at last 10 songs to my favorites
        list.... Great music!  Our wait staff was so lovely and every food item
        we had was delicious. Those fries....so good. We couldn't make a
        decision on dessert, so we ended up with three. Definitely recommend for
        a fun night out. Would love to come back on our next trip to Nashville!

        My husband and my best friend surprised me with a birthday dinner here.
        I was so delighted. From finding the non descript entrance to the
        coolest music scene in a restaurant. We sat right in front of the DJ and
        the ambience was so fun! I added at last 10 songs to my favorites
        list.... Great music!  Our wait staff was so lovely and every food item
        we had was delicious. Those fries....so good. We couldn't make a
        decision on dessert, so we ended up with three. Definitely recommend for
        a fun night out. Would love to come back on our next trip to Nashville!

        Every single dish we had and every single drink was delicious and top
        quality.  The presentation of each was lovely.  Our server Nikki, was
        outstanding, as she was able to describe each drink and dish to our
        taste preferences. The ambiance  was relaxed and classy with the
        selection of songs from good vinyls, emanating from a quality sound
        system.  The birthday acknowledgment was classy, yummy and just enough.
        This will continue to be one of our number 1 choices for top quality
        Japanese food and special occasions.  Triple applause for "888"!

        We had dinner at the sushi bar and were so impressed with the food and
        space. Highly recommend the fresh sushi but also loved the steak meal
        with carrots. The records wall is fantastic. Great whiskey and sake
        selection, as well as a couple good mocktails.

        Very cool space where there’s a DJ that plays vinyl albums.  Good food.
        Service is a little slow.  Made a reservation for a seat at the sushi
        bar which had wide availability (every 15 minutes) but still had to wait
        30 minutes past my reservation to get seated.  Would have appreciated an
        apology or something.

        Our experience at 888 absolutely blew me away! My partner and I are huge
        foodies and we know how rare it is to find a place that has an amazing
        atmosphere and incredible food; 888 managed to knock both of them out of
        the park. Our server Allie was so kind and helpful, and had the best
        suggestions for what to order. The asparagus tempura, "Not So Midori
        Sour" and table side wasabi were absolutely outstanding, and the chef
        special sushi roll that night was phenomenal. The DJ was also fantastic
        and had vibe down perfectly, it was exactly the listening bar experience
        I was hoping to have. We walked out saying it was a meal we'd still be
        talking about for a very long time. Couldn't recommend this spot enough!
