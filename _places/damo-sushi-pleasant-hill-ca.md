        teriyaki and tempura. Food was crunchy and fresh. Loved the salad
        dressing!

        Came here on a Sunday to waste time while we were waiting to sell our
        car. We originally were going to go eat vietnamese pho but saw that
        there was this sushi place in the same shopping plaza.  We went to the
        restaurant thinking it was open since the door was fully open but the
        staff told us they were closed until 3pm but they could still seat us
        anyways and we could wait about 10 more minutes for them to be ready. 
        They gave us menus and we took our time to see what they had.  When all
        the staff came back in we were waited on by a nice waitress who took our
        order and came back with our drinks.  We ordered the Damo specialty
        roll, char-siu ramen, beef udon, and a 3 item bento box. The ramen
        looked great and tasted good too but was on the small side with not too
        much noodles, the beef Udon was the same but it tasted good.  The Damo
        specialty roll was in the skinny side like it was a bit anorexic but
        again,  it tasted good. The 3 item bento box was good but the rice bowl
        serving was tiny as well as the California roll that it came with.  The
        rice was also a bit hard like it hadn't been fluffed and they scooped
        the hard top or edge of the rice pot. Oh, I almost forgot that the Miso
        soup was awesome! It had a buttery taste to it, which was nice and
        unique!


        Overall the restaurant had great ambiance,  very friendly staff,  food
        was good and worth visiting again but the portions and proportion of the
        food was lacking.  I left still hungry since i was the one that ordered
        the sushi roll... 😓🥹

        This location was already amazing a year ago, but they've revamped it!
        The dining area looks nice, and the food seems to have improved as well.
        Even the water tastes cleaner! Always excited when we choose this for
        date night

        I don't know what happened to this place like if they got new management
        or ownership or something, but the quality is just so bad now. The last
        time I ordered from here they never confirmed or started my order
        despite me ordering well in advance, so I ended up having to wait 30
        minutes over my 20 minute lunch break just to get my food, and when I
        got back to work and went to eat it was the completely wrong order, and
        completely gross quality at that. I took a break from this place for a
        few months before trying again tonight, didn’t have to wait too long and
        actually got my order, but customer service was horrible when handing my
        order off to me, and the food was once again gross and just bad quality.
        I used to go here 1-2+ times a week and always loved it, so disappointed
        to lose such a beloved spot, but I’d rather save my money than eat this
        stuff ever again.

        We are avid sushi eaters an we like to pick a new place everytime.


        Staff were splendid and kind.


        The food was delicious and price wise we actually got more then the last
        place we ate that was more expensive an less food.


        We know sushi doesn’t always feel you up so we ordered a few things an
        shared with everyone at the the table. The spicy tuna was actually
        spicy. Whoot!


        No kids menu- no problem- 😉 chicken teriyaki, rice, udon, tempera,
        seaweed salad!


        The one Star removed is for the temperature an bathrooms. It was rather
        warm inside an the bathroom area smells which in an warmer environment
        penetrates the air. The roof is massively high. They need to spend some
        money an put in a fake ceiling an better air.


        Overall good place. Will be back if on this side of town. We are
        everything!
