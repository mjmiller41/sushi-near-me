        LOVE this place! We’d been missing a great vegan sushi place ever since
        Tataki Canyon closed, and I’m so glad Lion opened. Everything we had was
        delicious, and the little carts going around, Dim Sum-style, were a nice
        treat. Service was wonderful. The no-tips model makes me feel good about
        patronizing an establishment that pays its servers fairly rather than
        forcing them to rely on tips. We’ll be back here frequently.

        Great addition to the neighborhood. The food is not your typical sushi
        fare. More like little dishes, grilled items, selection of rolls and
        other innovative chef specials. Everything is super fresh and tasty.

        You can taste the quality in the food. The fish tastes so fresh and the
        flavor profile is elegant and well balanced. An experience overall!
        Service is also just so great. I love how they come out with different
        appetizers in a cart to choose from. Mun & Suki were wonderful!

        Heya (vegan) and Bow to your sensei (vegan) were both recommended by the
        waitress and they both did not disappoint!! Both were delicious - but I
        must say the Heya roll won my top choice. All the flavors in the roll
        and the vegan salmon made me feel like I was enjoying a ‘real sushi
        roll’ 😍


        It was also nice to have the whole top floor section to ourselves while
        eating 🤗 the waitress was attentive and friendly.


        The only things I wouldn’t order again were the two items from the dim
        sum cart (see photos) as they were just alright - too much rice

        I visited during their soft open, it was just their fourth night of
        business. The service was still getting itself worked out, so things
        were a little slower than I would have liked, but things were on par
        with other soft open operations I've seen.


        The food was really good and more than made up for the front-of-house
        hiccups. The dishes were unique and filled with a host of flavors. We
        ordered one main from the menu and then had a bunch from the cart. This
        place will be GREAT if you have a mix of omnivores, vegetarians, and
        vegans.


        We ordered "Paul the Pilot", named in honor of a customer which has
        followed the chef in various restaurants through the years. The dish is
        cooked table-side using open flame, it's really an experience. What
        emerges from the foil is a delicious combination of flavors.


        Next the restaurant has a cart that comes around every 5-10 minutes with
        small plates that might be sushi, maki, or a variety of other
        interesting creations. I can't remember exactly all the things we
        ordered, but they included scallop sashimi, vegan "salmon" sashimi, a
        couple of rolls, and bean curd pockets filled with rice and sea urchin.


        A great "bonus" for this place is that it is tip-free. I love not having
        this pressure. I thought the prices were reasonable, and if I take 20%
        off, the prices are quite good. Thank you to the chef/owner who decided,
        "let's just put the real cost on the menu"!


        Do GO HERE if you want a calm atmosphere to enjoy unique dishes, in each
        of which you will find a complimenting set of flavors, and an
        interesting dining style, thanks to the mix of menu and surprises from
        the cart.


        Do NOT GO HERE, probably, if you're looking for a fast bite as parents
        with a couple of kids. The service is likely to be a little slower than
        you want and the dishes might be a challenge for picky or nervous
        diners.
