        The food was good. I have 3/5 for food because the VALUE isn't there.
        It's expensive for what you get. I think our table was $40 per person.
        They first fill you up on noodles, salad, soup, and veggies so the meat
        portions are average (and not worth $40).

        All that said. The food is good. Not great, but perfectly respectable
        aside from maybe needing a bit of salt. (But I get that is a losing
        proposition for restaurants one man's too much is another's too little.
        We even disagreed at the table).

        Our server was great. He was fast and attentive, if not a bit weird.
        (The guy with the long beard).

        I wouldn't choose to go here again, however I wouldn't be opposed to it
        if others wanted to go.

        We did not sit at a hibachi table (by design, we didn't want to. We were
        all hungry after a long day of work). However the people that were at
        the tables where they cook the food in front of you looked like they
        were having a good time.

        The food was good. I have 3/5 for food because the VALUE isn't there.
        It's expensive for what you get. I think our table was $40 per person.
        They first fill you up on noodles, salad, soup, and veggies so the meat
        portions are average (and not worth $40).

        All that said. The food is good. Not great, but perfectly respectable
        aside from maybe needing a bit of salt. (But I get that is a losing
        proposition for restaurants one man's too much is another's too little.
        We even disagreed at the table).

        Our server was great. He was fast and attentive, if not a bit weird.
        (The guy with the long beard).

        So glad this place was worth the trek across the metro!

        Celebrated a friends birthday dinner here and we had so much fun and the
        food was really good too

        I ordered the Red Lotus for a cocktail-was very easy to drink probably
        more soda water than I needed though

        The hibachi dinner filet mignon and shrimp combo was delicious and a ton
        of food. Comes with the onion soup and then a small salad(not my
        favorite) and then the amazing fried rice and then noodles and
        vegetables. I was stuffed at the end so make sure you come hungry.

        Our chef was fun entertaining and cooked our food perfectly. Don't skimp
        on the yum yum sauce and the ginger sauce, I mix them together delish!

        The happy birthday song seems to happen every 30 mins!! and that got
        annoying but overall I enjoyed my first time there

        I have never dined in, but their food is delicious. I had multiple food
        items delivered to my home last year for my birthday celebration. They
        were punctual and brought the food laid out in a way that was ready to
        be eaten. I also order for pickup just a couple of weeks ago and was
        very pleased with the flavors and timeliness. Thank you! :)

        We are from out of town, celebrating and wanting a hibachi that cooks in
        front of the family. This place hit the spot. It’s much larger than
        expected, but the environment is fantastic. The atmosphere was great and
        all of the staff were terrific and friendly. We’ll be back.

        First time here. The chef was really good he wasn't getting all fancy
        like some get which I appreciate as one of the others in the twin cities
        is a bit much.

        The steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right and the shrimp
        also and the yum yum sauce! Fried rice was really good too. Good service
        and very laid back atmosphere. Prices were actually cheaper then the
        others around. And the portions were just right.

        If your not looking for the "show" and want great hibachi. Check it out
        you won't be disappointed!
