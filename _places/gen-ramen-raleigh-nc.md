        This is some of the best food I have ever eaten.  It was hot. The
        flavors far exceeded my expectations.  The dining area was comfortable
        and well decorated. Service was impeccable, drinks were filled well
        before they were empty. The food was prepared quickly and efficiently.

        One of the go-to ramen spots in the area. We ordered the chicken curry
        ramen, takoyaki, and chicken teriyaki donburi bowl this time around. The
        food was hot and very tasty. The staff was attentive and the atmosphere
        was great as always.

        Our weekend family outing led us here, and we waited about 15 minutes
        for a table. It's a smaller place, but they do their best to fit larger
        groups. The ramen portions are a touch smaller than other places, but
        the broth and ingredients really stand out in quality. The Tonkatsu was
        a highlight. If you like spicy, go for the top spice level – it's not
        overly intense. The Takoyaki was just right.


        We'd definitely come back when we're in the mood for good ramen.

        Dinned here on a Sunday evening. Cozy and nice vibes restaurant. We were
        seated right away. Our server was knowledgeable and answered all
        questions and helped us with our order.


        Ordered a veggie bao bun, and 2 Lemongrass Ramens. Both of them were
        perfect.


        Their spice levels are more of milder side. I ordered level 3 but it’s
        still not spicy enough. If you like your ramen spicy I think you can do 
        4 which is their highest level.


        Overall a nice find for Ramen and we elll visit again.

        This ain’t the ramen you’re making at home! This is the second time I
        have eaten here. My son is the ramen guy, I am a mere pedestrian.

        I slurped and enjoy my big bowl of ramen with a spice level of 2. They
        go to 4. I am glad I stopped where I did.

        I saw families and couples all slurping and enjoying themselves and the
        food.

        I hope to come again soon when I’m off Wake Forest Rd.

        Also I asked for a fork and there was no judgement.
