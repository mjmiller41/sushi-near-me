        TL;DR fresh, tasty, good price. Deep Sushi was very nice. It was our
        first time going in and they took great care of us. Typically sushi for
        two means spending over $100 but we left full and satisfied including an
        amazing dessert for around $80. We did not have any alcohol though and
        that would likely have pushed us over the $100 mark. Everything tasted
        fresh and delicious and had unique but vibrant flavors. I will be
        returning in the near future. Great spot for a date or family dinner. Oh
        and they have a weekend happy hour which is hard to find these days.

        items. It is a location that demands a visit. The staff are notably
        friendly.

        Service was quick, waitress was kind, outside area was good experience.
        The Patriot was a yummy roll, thought the ramen was good portioned but
        okay flavor to it.

        I love fried sushi and was looking for a sushi bar skilled at it. The
        food was amazing. I believe the fried rice is the best in Dallas. I
        tried all the food I could stomach and afford in one setting and wasnât
        disappointed. I came at a great time. Itâs a great place to chill after
        working all day. They have happy hour specials that include drinks and
        appetizers. The waiter was so kind and had a great personality. He gave
        me many recommendations and made sure I enjoyed my stay. You can pay on
        the tablet your server has. It looks like they even take mobile pay.
        Feedback: Only advice is the waiterâs zone partners could definitely
        speak to guests that arenât their own. They look at you for sure but
        that could be followed by a greeting or a smile. They talk to themselves
        and their guests, but if you are going to refill a water, or stare at
        your partnerâs guests, speak too.

        Parking is HORRIBLE, and you will more than likely have to pay if you
        wanna eat here. Sadly. Also, this area is LOADED with homeless people
        continuously trying to talk to you while you are just trying to get in
        the restaurant to eat. Once you get past those things, get ready to be
        amazed. The food is fantastic, simple as that.
