        Beauty in humble simplicity.


        The entrance door can be cumbersome especially if the strong winds are
        blowing. We were greeted inside and the gentleman kindly took our coats.
        He verified our reservations and remembered that it was to celebrate my
        wife's birthday. He led us to our reserved seats at the sushi bar and
        less than 5 minutes later we had another gentleman come by with the
        wine/cocktail menu.


        There were 2 sushi chefs at the counter and each was in charge of 4
        people that night. Each delectable course is explained where it is from,
        what is on it, recommend way of eating it and is served timely after the
        other as to enjoy their unique qualities. There is ample time to make
        small talk between each course so you don't feel rushed.


        The majority of pieces felt well crafted, and some were a bit
        overwhelming to the point it masked the adjuncts overpowered the flavor
        of the fish. It took away the focus from the fish and made the fish seem
        more like it was to enhance the flavor of i.e. ginger/scallion. The
        seared wagyu, super fatty tuna+uni, and seared super fatty tuna with a
        hint of salt were absolutely divine. The various sashimi+smoked tuna
        dish had a beautiful presentation. The least amazing for us was the
        tamago dish. It felt out of place and was uninspiring. It was as if they
        added it to the menu to increase the count of dishes they offer for
        their price. If they added it in as and off the menu surprise I wouldn't
        be complaining.


        Overall it was a great experience. For my wife's birthday they gave her
        a menu with a little writing from everyone on the staff to take home
        which was a bit cute. I feel that they could have given her something
        else considering the price and the Michelin star. Unfortunately we
        didn't have plans to keep it as a memento so we left it. I felt as if
        the server staff was a bit more conversational and welcoming that the
        sushi chefs prepping in front of us at the counter. We would of course
        be asked if we are enjoying everything but not much more than that.
        Maybe it's just me but an omakase is more than just the food. It's about
        the whole experience, interaction, intimacy and connection to the people
        and the food.


        Paid street parking/lot in the area, no valet, recommend reservations,
        gratuity already included in the check, free coat check, handicap
        accessible, no pets.

        Beauty in humble simplicity.


        The entrance door can be cumbersome especially if the strong winds are
        blowing. We were greeted inside and the gentleman kindly took our coats.
        He verified our reservations and remembered that it was to celebrate my
        wife's birthday. He led us to our reserved seats at the sushi bar and
        less than 5 minutes later we had another gentleman come by with the
        wine/cocktail menu.


        There were 2 sushi chefs at the counter and each was in charge of 4
        people that night. Each delectable course is explained where it is from,
        what is on it, recommend way of eating it and is served timely after the
        other as to enjoy their unique qualities. There is ample time to make
        small talk between each course so you don't feel rushed.


        The majority of pieces felt well crafted, and some were a bit
        overwhelming to the point it masked the adjuncts overpowered the flavor
        of the fish. It took away the focus from the fish and made the fish seem
        more like it was to enhance the flavor of i.e. ginger/scallion. The
        seared wagyu, super fatty tuna+uni, and seared super fatty tuna with a
        hint of salt were absolutely divine. The various sashimi+smoked tuna
        dish had a beautiful presentation. The least amazing for us was the
        tamago dish. It felt out of place and was uninspiring. It was as if they
        added it to the menu to increase the count of dishes they offer for
        their price. If they added it in as and off the menu surprise I wouldn't
        be complaining.

        Hidden gem nestled in the west loop.  About 15 seats at the counter and
        a few small tables.  We sat at the counter.  Every bite was delicious
        and unique.  Pricy but worth it for a special occasion.

        We were extremely excited to try out Chef Park’s Michelin starred
        omakase experience in west loop after falling in love with Juno. The
        tasting menu flew by for as many courses as it was but we were a bit
        disappointed with the service. Chef Park was  engaging and personable
        through the meal and the intimate setting of the restaurant makes this a
        natural choice for a special occasion/date.

        Wow!  This place was incredible!  The food, service, atmosphere were
        very special.  I’ve always wanted to go to a place like this after
        seeing the documentary “I Dream of Jiro”, years ago.  So glad I went.

        We went here the weekend after 2/14. The food was amazing, esp the lamb,
        uni, raw shrimp, and soup courses. However, I found the pricing to be
        deceptive/scammy and it wasn’t enough food. Firstly, on tock the tasting
        menu was listed as $185 when we booked, but when the bill came it was
        suddenly $215pp (they probably didn’t update it at the time, but they
        should’ve). Most importantly, the chef offered a salmon piece with king
        oyster mushrooms in the middle of the meal and asked if everyone would
        like to “try it” as if it was a complimentary piece. Everyone in the
        room said enthusiastically, sure why not, and accepted the extra piece.
        I believe others assumed it was a complimentary piece as well. I didn’t
        think it was not complimentary esp given it wasn’t a special or
        memorable piece at all. Then when the bill came it was an extra $60
        basically, $26 per piece. We felt like we were baited. There are many
        ways to convey this course wasn’t complimentary. The most obvious way
        would have been for the server, to offer the special item on the menu,
        not just the chef casually asking if we wanted to “try” a piece. Being a
        fine dining establishment, they should have known to convey this better.
        With the bill being with all these unexpected curveballs, the $350 pp
        total felt not worth it for just one Michelin star. I also was only semi
        full at the end of the meal (I’m less than 110lbs…) as the nigiris were
        small. Side note was that it was really cold inside for some reason, the
        other guests around and I were freezing and had to ask them to turn up
        the space heaters. TLDR: great tasting food, gorgeous interior, but
        deceptive pricing, left semi full
