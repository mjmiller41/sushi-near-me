        We were in town for my son's hockey game and needed something to eat. We
        chose the Poke Bowls, and they were delicious. The service was great,
        the person who took our order was kind, knowledgeable and efficient. We
        would eat here often if we lived here. 10/10 would recommend!

        The poke bowls here are just the best. No other ramen place or even
        restaurant comes close. The food is incredibly fresh and the staff has
        been the nicest every time I visit.

        Delicious from the 1st bite.  I make sure to buy one or more "make your
        own" sushi burritos every time I'm in town.  Bought one for my S.O. last
        year, and now, each time I'm near there, he requests I bring him two
        back as well.

        This time: 1 chicken, 1 fresh salmon.

        Next time: 1 fresh salmon, 1 [fresh] tuna.

        Haven't tried the bowl/other versions.

        Reasonably priced, excellent service, family run.  The food has tasted
        fresh every time.  Appreciate the non-plastic take out container (sauce
        containers are still plastic)

        I remembered to snap a photo for you all before I finished.

        Enjoy.

        Without a doubt, the best ramen place I have been to in the area.
        Service is quick and everyone there is friendly. Food is DELICIOUS.
        Tried a couple things and cannot wait to go back to try more of their
        menu. We had the spicy Tonkotsu ramen and it was amazing. The soup was
        spicy and flavorful. They use egg noodles which are my favorite and the
        pork belly was nice and tender. Definitely recommend this or the
        original Tonkotsu ramen if you’re not into spicy. It’s not too hot but
        there’s a little kick. We also got the Lincoln signature roll aka a
        wrap. I’ve never had a sushi wrap before and I was pleasantly surprised
        by how much I liked it. The process there is cool too because you can
        actually create your own burritos, bowls, poke bowls, etc. Lastly, I got
        the J.K Rowling fries. They are korean or Japanese style fries topped
        with kimchi, pork belly, cheese, spicy mayo, and teriyaki sauce. Pretty
        heavy side dish but very tasty. One hundred percent would recommend
        checking this place out. I was not disappointed. Update: adding comments
        for COVID regulations as of September 2021. Interior is very clean and
        all staff members are wearing masks. Felt like a very safe experience.

        Reviewing the tonkatsu ONLY  ---- Ordered takeout tonkatsu ramen for
        lunch based on all of the great reviews. The service, portion size, and
        atmosphere were all relatively good however.... I hate to say it, the
        soup was terrible. Very little pork flavor at all in the broth and the
        fat was not properly emulsified. The noodles were of decent quality but
        the pork belly had not been cooked for long enough. The pork was stringy
        and not tender, with a strange cloyingly sweet aftertaste. It seems like
        the ramen recipe prioritizing looking and sounding pretty, rather than
        the broth itself.
