        I dined in today with a friend of mine. The food was incredible and the
        staff was so kind and attentive.  The Spicy Crab roll was my absolute
        favorite! It was so refreshing yet tasty. My friend enjoyed her Chicken
        Tempura Roll, the serving size was so big she couldn’t finish it but it
        was delicious. The Mango Sticky rice was sweet and tasty, the mangoes
        were very ripe and cold as well. We will be coming here more often as
        regulars and hope to try more on the menu!

        I dined in today with a friend of mine. The food was incredible and the
        staff was so kind and attentive.  The Spicy Crab roll was my absolute
        favorite! It was so refreshing yet tasty. My friend enjoyed her Chicken
        Tempura Roll, the serving size was so big she couldn’t finish it but it
        was delicious. The Mango Sticky rice was sweet and tasty, the mangoes
        were very ripe and cold as well. We will be coming here more often as
        regulars and hope to try more on the menu!

        Food was edible and that’s all I can say about it. Was not enjoyable in
        any way though. Flavor wise the fish wasn’t what I wanted it to be but I
        really tried to mind over matter it. But it wasn’t good. The sweet
        potato roll had a lot of filling which, while generous, was actually too
        much for what it was. Wish it were crispier as well but I know some of
        that is lost in delivery. Sushi did look like whoever rolled it had
        never rolled sushi before. Lastly, the delivery driver did not call,
        text, or update on grubhub that it was delivered, but after reading
        other reviews, I went outside and it was there, on my porch. Delivery
        driver should be letting people know when it’s delivered.

        Just tried Sushi Mizu for takeout for the first time and I have to say
        it was delicious. Very pleasant surprise due to the mixed reviews.


        I will admit walking in made me question if I made the right call. I
        would highly suggest taking out, but undoubtedly the food was great.


        I got the KFC Bao (a must), eel avocado roll, shrimp avocado roll, New
        Haven roll (amazing!), and a Yaki Udon w/ beef (good - think beef lo
        mien not as oily, and had a good array of veggies: mushroom, broccoli,
        zucchini, and carrots).


        All was great, I will be returning, seems like a nice working family.


        Update: second time - still awesome! The Dinner Bento Box is good value.

        Really wish I had seen the reviews before ordering. 1. I ordered shrimp
        tempura, and the tempura was cut into these 4 gigantic blocks, and they
        didn’t give me any soy sauce, no, instead they drizzled it on it so some
        of the rice was either soggy with soy sauce or there was none on it. I
        like to dip my sushi myself. And then I also ordered hibachi. It tasted
        like shrimp and broccoli, which honestly that’s exactly what it was.
        Shrimp and broccoli drowning in what tasted like mirin and soy sauce.
        And it also came with white rice. No hibachi fried rice or hibachi
        noodles, just a container of white rice. I would never waste my money
        here ever again.

        The food is trash. I got the soggy general tso with gloomy fried rice
        and overcooked hard chunks of pork in it. I haven't had it but I
        wouldn't recommend the sushi either if they can mess up chicken and rice
        so badly.
