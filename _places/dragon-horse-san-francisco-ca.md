        Overall good value for the area.

        They were out of chicken gizzards so I got the chicken skewers. They
        were well-cooked, but had a strange, almost bitter flavor.

        The nigiri tuna was good.

        If I could give more stars I would. The food is always delicious, the
        cocktails are incredibly creative and perfectly mixed, and the service
        could not be better.


        Every time I come here is a great experience. I honestly can't say
        enough good things about this restaurant. It's a hidden gem for sure.

        Let me start with the positives - the drinks were really, really good.
        We were big fans of the Onion Cream Cheese and Seaweed Mustard
        cocktails, both of which sound a bit bizarre, but had amazing flavor
        profiles. We also tried the Tomato Jalapeño, Guava Thyme, Smoke Umami,
        and Tea N Strawberry, all of which were very solid.


        The scallop nigiri was really fresh and the karaage & gyudon were
        fragrant and perfectly cooked. The hamachi collar was tender, but had
        some bitter parts (maybe from burnt bits that stuck onto the outside
        from the grill?), but overall, was pretty decent.


        My biggest gripe was with the service. It was a Monday night and wasn’t
        terribly crowded when we arrived. Drinks came out within 20-30 minutes,
        which is a bit slow but acceptable, but the first dish (gyudon) didn’t
        come out until 45 minutes after ordering. The 2 small pieces of scallop
        nigiri, which didn’t even require any cooking, took a full hour. We also
        ordered monkfish liver and hamachi collar and checked with the waitstaff
        2 times on the status of our order because our food was coming out so
        slow. We waited 1.5 hours for these two dishes but they maybe forgot to
        put the order in or and never checked with the kitchen any time we asked
        about our food. When we inquired a third time, they finally checked with
        the chef and said they had run out of the monkfish and only just started
        cooking the hamachi. We ended up subbing the missing monkfish for
        karaage because we were starving.


        The portion sizes for each were also quite small and we had 4 people, so
        it was difficult to fill up on enough food for it to qualify as a proper
        dinner. We had planned to order more, but the food was coming out so
        slowly that we decided to just eat more elsewhere. Also because our food
        took forever, none of our individual dishes came out at the same time,
        so we were awkwardly left watching each other eat.


        The waitstaff was kind and apologetic when we mentioned how long it was
        taking, but the  long wait times soured our experience. Such a shame
        when the food and drinks themselves were quite good.

        Restaurant blending Japanese aesthetics with a touch of fantasy.The
        nigiri rolls are very good and Each piece bursts with fresh flavors .The
        Game of Thrones/Camelot-ish-inspired cocktails are a brilliant touch
        that adds an extra layer of fun to the night.Service was prompt and
        friendly, and the staff was knowledgeable about the menu.

        Out of the 3 dishes we ordered, dragon horse roll, organic chicken
        skewers, and karaage chicken, the karaage chicken was the only decent
        dish. The sushi tasted pretty low quality like what you’d get from the
        supermarket, and the organic chicken skewers were too salty. For drinks
        we got the flaming dragon and miso peppercorn and ended up preferring
        each other’s drink, so we swapped. I think maybe this place would be
        better for karaoke where the food is just an addition to the
        entertainment.
