        Perfect Simplicity: A Return to The Hamilton


        As DC residents, my wife and I have come to appreciate restaurants that
        blend quality, atmosphere, and consistency. Our recent dinner at The
        Hamilton, a repeat visit during the vibrant Cherry Blossom season, once
        again confirmed its place among the city’s most satisfying dining
        experiences. “Perfect Simplicity” best describes our evening—not because
        the dishes were simple in execution, but because everything felt
        effortlessly right.


        🌸 The Cherry Blossom Glow: Atmosphere & Service

        With DC in full bloom and visitors flowing in from across the country
        and abroad, The Hamilton was lively and energetic. The space was
        bustling but never chaotic, and the service stood out—attentive,
        polished, and unhurried, allowing us to fully enjoy each course in
        comfort.


        🍜 Starter: Miso Soup

        I began with the Miso Soup, which turned out to be a quiet revelation.
        The broth was velvety and savory, its umami notes deepened by shiitake
        mushrooms sliced to perfection, silky tofu, scallions, and the subtle
        marine touch of seaweed. This was a dish in harmony—elegant, balanced,
        and deeply satisfying.


        🧀 Shared Starter: Grayson Cheese Plate

        We shared the Grayson cheese, part of the American Farmhouse Cheese
        selection, and it delivered a beautiful range of flavors and textures.
        The semi-soft, aromatic cow’s milk cheese was accompanied by pickled red
        onions with a delightful crunch, tangy and vibrant. The cranberry walnut
        bread was both chewy and fragrant, and the two accompanying spreads
        added complexity—one fig-forward and sweet, the other earthy and savory.
        It was a starter that invited slow bites and long conversation.


        🍝 Main: Classic Meatballs & Pomodoro

        I followed with the Classic Meatballs & Pomodoro—an unfussy but
        comforting dish done impeccably well. The meatballs were tender and
        well-seasoned, nestled in a bright and savory pomodoro sauce, with a
        base of Parmesan polenta that was creamy, rich, and wonderfully
        textured. It felt like something straight out of a rustic Italian
        kitchen.


        🥪 Her Main: Roasted Turkey Sandwich

        My wife enjoyed the Roasted Turkey Sandwich, built on everything
        ciabatta and layered with pimento cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and
        scallion aioli. She noted the turkey’s shaved texture, which gave the
        sandwich a light yet satisfying mouthfeel. The flavors were vibrant and
        well-integrated, especially the subtle heat of the pimento cheese and
        the crisp, smoky bacon. Served with golden, perfectly crisped fries, it
        was hearty and delightful.


        🍷 A Place We’ll Keep Coming Back To

        While we are still getting to know DC’s full culinary landscape, The
        Hamilton has quickly become a favorite—a spot that balances
        crowd-pleasing versatility with thoughtful execution. The space is
        elegant yet relaxed, the menu broad but curated, and the service
        consistently warm and professional.


        Whether it’s a simple bowl of soup or a full entrée, The Hamilton
        doesn’t overreach—it delivers with confidence and care, and that makes
        it one of the most dependable and rewarding dining options in downtown
        DC.


        Rating: 5/5

        Standouts: Miso Soup, Grayson Cheese Plate, Classic Meatballs

        Vibe: Warm, lively, welcoming—great for both locals and visitors

        Would we return? Absolutely. Again and again.

        Prior Visit:

        We stopped a week ago in for an early dinner at The Hamilton in DC and
        had a wonderful experience. I went with the Cobb salad, and my wife had
        Evan’s Chicken — both were delicious and beautifully prepared. The
        atmosphere struck the perfect balance: stylish and energetic, yet still
        warm and welcoming. It felt very DC, in the best possible way. The staff
        was friendly and attentive, making the whole experience even more
        enjoyable. We’ll definitely be back, we we have done recently before
        this visit. Definitively we are becoming regular customers

        Perfect Simplicity: A Return to The Hamilton


        As DC residents, my wife and I have come to appreciate restaurants that
        blend quality, atmosphere, and consistency. Our recent dinner at The
        Hamilton, a repeat visit during the vibrant Cherry Blossom season, once
        again confirmed its place among the city’s most satisfying dining
        experiences. “Perfect Simplicity” best describes our evening—not because
        the dishes were simple in execution, but because everything felt
        effortlessly right.


        🌸 The Cherry Blossom Glow: Atmosphere & Service

        With DC in full bloom and visitors flowing in from across the country
        and abroad, The Hamilton was lively and energetic. The space was
        bustling but never chaotic, and the service stood out—attentive,
        polished, and unhurried, allowing us to fully enjoy each course in
        comfort.


        🍜 Starter: Miso Soup

        I began with the Miso Soup, which turned out to be a quiet revelation.
        The broth was velvety and savory, its umami notes deepened by shiitake
        mushrooms sliced to perfection, silky tofu, scallions, and the subtle
        marine touch of seaweed. This was a dish in harmony—elegant, balanced,
        and deeply satisfying.

        Last week, a friend and I visited The Hamilton for Happy Hour. While it
        wasn't my friend's first time there, it was my first experience dining
        at the restaurant. The place is quite large, featuring several different
        seating areas. We chose a table towards the back, which was nice since
        the front area was packed.


        Initially, Kate was our server, and she was fantastic—very attentive and
        helpful in assisting us with our roll selections. Once Kate's shift
        ended, we were served by Erin. Erin was pleasant, but she wasn't as
        attentive as Kate had been.


        We ordered a variety of sushi rolls, and I also tried the cream of crab
        soup. The soup arrived first. It had a good flavor, but I found it a bit
        bland for my taste; however, it was full of crab, which I really
        enjoyed. The sushi rolls were decent, but I've definitely had better
        before. Each of us ordered three rolls: my friend had the Tsunami,
        Crunchy Tuna, and Rainbow rolls, while I chose the Caterpillar,
        Firecracker, and King Toro rolls. Our favorites were the Rainbow and
        King Toro rolls.


        If you're unsure about what to eat, The Hamilton offers a wide selection
        of options to choose from.

        I had an excellent experience at The Hamilton! The food was
        outstanding—fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The service was
        just as impressive, with attentive and friendly staff making sure
        everything was perfect.


        The restaurant itself is spotless, well-maintained, and has a welcoming
        atmosphere. It’s a great spot for any occasion—whether you're here for a
        business meeting, a romantic dinner, or just a nice meal with friends
        and family.


        The prices are very reasonable for the quality and experience you get. I
        highly recommend The Hamilton to anyone looking for a top-tier dining
        experience.

        Look up and around at the architecture and paintings. They are very
        interesting. The bread basket was good. The branzino with no head was
        excellent! The brussel sprouts were cooked to perfection with great
        seasoning too. The truffle fries were good too! Service was excellent
        too. Two bars too. Lots of space. Book reservation on open table too.
        Packed restaurant due to cherry blossoms 🌸
