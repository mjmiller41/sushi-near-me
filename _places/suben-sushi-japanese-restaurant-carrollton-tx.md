        Went to swing by with my co-worker on our break the other day. The
        service was AMAZING alongside the food. We were warmly greeted by a
        lovely woman and I was given immediate attention. She checked on me and
        my friend regularly making sure we were enjoying our time there. We both
        got sushi rolls, I’ve been eating Sushi for years and the food we got
        exceeded my expectations. Cannot believe it took me so long to grab a
        bite here! We definitely plan on returning soon. The environment was
        quaint and lovely.

        This is not a Japanese ran establishment. The man at the counter is not
        Japanese. I ordered the California Roll and it was horrible. I have
        never had a roll that was SWEET and full of sugar! Absolutely
        disgusting. The man at the counter acted like he was surprised that I
        wasn’t there for “pickup” because I’m African- American. Don’t waste
        your money. It’s not authentic.

        We were craving sushi and decided to order at this place (through door
        dash). I paid 75$ and could not have been any more disappointed. We had
        4 sushi rolls and some noodles with chicken. The amount you get for your
        money is ridiculous. They shoved 3 of our rolls in one medium sized to
        go box. You get 8 pieces tops, and they are so small. If I pay that much
        money, I expect it to be a little more than a mouth full. The taste was
        average, and it didn't even come with any wasabi or gari. It looked so
        cheap. The noodles barely have any chicken in it, only cabbage. I sure
        won't order here again; it is not worth the money.

        I spent 27 dollars at this place and left hungry. The service was very
        slow, yet the rolls came out looking like they took only a few minutes
        to make. It felt like their wasn't even any ac in the restaurant. The
        quality of the food was average at best, and the quality of the wasabi
        and soy sauce were both horrible. The attached photo is all I got for 27
        dollars. For that same price I could go to another place to get more
        food at a better or similar quality or even go to my local Walmart and
        get much more than what i got here and if made fresh, of much better
        flavor and quality. There are many, many places to get sushi in
        Carrollton, and I advise you to not waste your money here and instead go
        somewhere else.

  places in the neighborhood, this one delivers a generally enjoyable experience
  with a few minor tweaks that could enhance value. Despite the mixed notes, the
  positive vibes and high ratings make it a worthwhile stop for anyone craving
  Japanese flavors.
