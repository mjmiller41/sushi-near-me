        Great Place. It was recommended to me on a Facebook group [eat outside
        your world] and we went before seeing the final dress rehearsal for Good
        Night, and Good Luck. Will definitely be back. The 1up machine near the
        bathroom is a great touch.

        We passed by this place and saw good review, so we went it.


        The staff members are brilliant and deserve all the praise of their
        service. The food, unfortunately, could be improved. The okonomiyaki was
        not great, I could only eat a slice of it. The noodle was just okay, and
        I am being generous.

        This place was a nice little surprise.  It's kind of like a blend of
        many kinds of small Japanese restaurants into one, almost like a
        restaurant sampler and a great bar in one. What this meant to us is that
        while I am not sure that any single food dish we had was a 10/10, the
        vast amount of unique foods we could try alone made the place a good
        spot.  The vast selection of sake and other Japanese beverages that pair
        well with those dishes made it a great spot.  There were grilled meats,
        ramen, sushi, onigiri, okonomiyaki, and more.


        If you are an adventurous eater, you would likely be satisfied with many
        of the options.  From the grilled meat side we tried beef tongue which
        we both agreed was good and chicken gizzards which split our group
        texturally.  We had gotten the pickles with this (oshinko) and I would
        highly recommend pairing any grilled meats with those and a drink.  I
        would comment that the kimchi didn't really fit with the pickles, but we
        loved the pickled daikon and the spicier green pickles.  The monk liver
        and salmon roe (ankimo) was another adventurous dish that we thought was
        okay.  The spaghetti with creamy spicy cod roe (mentai pasta) was
        another very unique one, we could have taken or left.


        Overall though, I would suggest trying maybe fried and grilled meats
        with the pickles and booze.  We also tried two types of onigiri which
        were both very good, plum filling the non grilled one and spicy cod roe
        filling the grilled one.  Both of the onigiri were excellent, but I
        really think the grilled onigiri stands out as perhaps the best dish of
        the night.


        We did try the miso soup, which was very good, however there is a lot of
        salt in all the food so I would tell anyone to consider if they really
        need that much salt before ordering.  We tried a sushi roll, which was
        good, but it was hard not to find the sushi selection just a little bit
        disappointing.  There were maki rolls and sashimi, but no nigiri or
        temaki which just seems like such an easy miss.  There's a big
        difference between a quality slice of yellowtail nigiri and a maki roll.


        I wish we would have gotten to try more, but we left very stuffed and
        also a bit tipsy.  We were very free flowing in our orders, ordering
        just a few items at a time and the staff seemed very prepared and
        acquainted with that.  We also ordered a nigori bottle of sake to start
        (this was a great deal and kicked us off properly) before we later
        finished with a higher proof shochu and mixed drink.  I do think I would
        have appreciated the option to get flights here to lean more heavily
        into the trying everything vibe.  I have never had shochu before and
        while my selection was fine, it would have been nice to know if I just
        picked the wrong one or if I'm just not a huge shochu fan without having
        to order several entire drinks.  Same for the sake honestly, need
        flights.


        The restaurant itself seemed fairly clean, was popular but not
        overcrowded, and was very well themed.  There were anime posters, manga,
        a vertical standing record player, the bar looked cool.  Overall a good
        vibe.

        Tip Included, Bad Service, Smelly Restaurant - Not My Place Anymore...


        We’ve been to Sake Bar many times before, across their different
        locations, and have had a lot of great experiences. Among friends and
        family, I’ve always recommended Sake Bar as the go-to place to hang out.
        Even though they’ve moved around, Sake Bar was my number-one Japanese
        restaurant, and I didn't want to lose that connection.


        However, my recent experiences there were awful. During my last two
        visits, the food was either overly salty or incredibly bland. The
        okonomiyaki was the worst—it tasted like it had just been microwaved,
        with an unreasonably salty flavor.


        The karaage and spicy karaage were over-fried and rock-hard. Sure, they
        were crispy—so crispy they made my jaw hurt! The sunakimo, on the other
        hand, was dripping with oil, making every bite unpleasant.


        To make matters worse, main dish; eel over rice arrived around 15
        minutes after we had finished all our appetizers—talk about bad timing.


        The entire restaurant had an awful smell, and it was a relief to get
        outside and breathe fresh air. It really makes me wonder what’s wrong
        with their ventilation system.


        And to top it all off, they charged a tip automatically for our table of
        just two people. I’m pretty sure this isn’t legal, and the server didn’t
        even mention it when handing us the bill. Wow. Expecting extra tips
        without providing good service? No thanks.
