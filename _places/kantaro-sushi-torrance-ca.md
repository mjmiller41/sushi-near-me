        Best omakase for the value in South Bay. Owned by a Japanese husband and
        wife duo in a strip mall corner. Parking has always been available every
        time we’ve been here, and we’ve came over 6+ times now. Go often and
        keep them in business for years to come!

        Great value for the money. The amount served in their omakase was very
        satisfying for us. It felt like the progression of the dishes (with
        reappearances of a few that were cooked and served in two different
        forms to enjoy), along with the unique dinnerware each course was served
        on, were well thought-out. A wide range of flavors and textures that
        excite the senses—most were familiar, with a few that were unexpected
        and fun. The green tea/matcha they serve in retro cups is quality. All
        of this in a nostalgic, no-frills space with prompt and friendly
        service.

        So. Much. Food.


        Hole in the wall spot with amazing quality and great price. Waitress
        explained each dish. I’d say the variety was less than other omakase,
        but the quantity and flavor was spot on. Sake is really cheap too.
        Definitely coming back.

        I love mom and pop joints like this. The omakase, which was reasonably
        priced, was an amazing experience. Each offering was prepared
        masterfully.


        This unassuming restaurant is located at the corner of a petite shopping
        plaza, so parking shouldn’t be too difficult. It’s best to make a
        reservation well in advance.

        A True hole in the wall omakase experience. It's like time traveling
        back to the 90s but not in the good sense. The amount of food you get is
        definitely worth it, but our experience included partially defrosted
        Toro nigiri, and very rushed service. Dishes were brought to our table
        before we could even finish the previous one. Highlights were the black
        bass and desserts.
