        Stopped off here when they opened before a concert. The staff was very
        nice. The food was delicious. Small place but not cramped. Everything
        was fresh and hot. They have can sodas, so there are no refills, but
        that's my only complaint. Will be back to try other rolls. Highly
        suggest the unagi with tobiko. So delicious.

        I recently visited Sushi California and was blown away by their amazing
        Dragon Roll. It was a perfect blend of flavors and textures, beautifully
        presented. The service was equally impressive—friendly, attentive, and
        efficient. Dining at Sushi California was a delightful experience, and I
        highly recommend it for both the fantastic food and exceptional service.

        Walked by this place today, noticing the sign on the street showing BOGO
        hand rolls and went for it.


        I’m very happy I did! These were excellent, and very fresh! That’s
        always a worry with an unfamiliar sushi joint mid-week, this place
        really impressed. Tuna was very fresh, rice was perfect. Ginger was
        crisp.


        The restaurant is small with a cozy bar, doesn’t stand out that much
        from the outside but I could certainly spend some time here eating and
        enjoying company.


        We will be coming back soon for Omakase!

        Wow. What a surprise. We found this place by accident to be honest. We
        were looking for a good place to eat and walked past this place.  Came
        back later as we couldn't find anything else that looked good. Kiyomi
        was an excellent waitress and was very friendly and helpful. We had the
        49er, Mexican, and Lion king rolls which were excellent. But the chefs
        choice sashimi and hamashi was beyond delicious. Excellent atmosphere
        too. We went on a Friday which had live music,  a nice jazz duo played
        by 2 Japanese musicians which was perfect atmosphere for this place.
        Really pleased with our experience. Will recommend to my friends for
        sure.

        Came in here on my lunch break a couple of times recently, one take out
        and one dine in.

        This spot looks to be a smaller family owned business, Both times that I
        came in. I received good customer service from the guy in front as well
        as good quality food from the chef. I will definitely be coming back
        soon.
