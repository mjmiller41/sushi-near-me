        This place offers some exotic Nigiri options that we haven't tried
        before. We like that most of their rolls don't use imitation crab and
        fancy sauces to over compensate for the imitation filling. I chose this
        place because I wanted the fan fair of a sushi boat. If your order is
        large enough, they'll fulfill the request. We went on a Sunday night,
        and the place was full, but not loud. They've got a couple of really
        cute seating options depending on the size of your party. We'll still
        explore the other sushi restaurants in town, but this one has so far
        been the best sushi we've had in Colorado.

        We had such a wonderful time with our kids here. It's super kid friendly
        and the kids menu has so many options. I got the 007 roll and the taste
        was amazing. Our waitress was also very friendly. The food even came out
        very quickly.

        beautiful presentation and a nice variety of appetizers and entrees.
        Service is great and we always look forward to the friendly

        This place is so yummy! My group happened to find parking right outside
        this restaurant and we decided to try it out for lunch. I'm so glad we
        did because the sushi they prepare is fantastic and and so well
        prepared! The presentation of each plate is beautiful and the staff are
        so friendly and welcoming. The energy in this establishment is positive
        and tranquil and the decor is really cool. We had a great experience and
        we will definitely be back! Thank you Zanmai!!

        Don't order the King Crab roll (with the cooked crab on top).   We first
        tried it three months ago when it was new.  It was pretty good, so we
        ordered it again a month later when we went, and this time it tasted a
        bit burned/off.   We thought a cook was having an off day.  Then we
        ordered it this weekend.  You could tell someone had burned the crab
        topping, but they still decided to serve it.  It was burned so bad the
        whole roll smelled like burned food.  We were really hungry and ate
        three pieces before we stopped eating it.  I told the server but she
        didn't offer to to anything- remake it, refund it, or talk to the
        kitchen.  She clearly saw we had only eaten half the roll.  The other
        rolls we've had here are fine, but when your average bill is $90-100 for
        two people you expect higher quality.  I have to rethink how often I
        visit here.  Just be warned about the crab roll.  I was burping burned
        crab topping all night because of it, and my wife had bad indegestion
        also.

  What Visitors Are Buzzing About$$$Visitors often rave about the fresh and
  high-quality fish used in the rolls and nigiri, highlighting how the variety
  keeps things exciting without relying on artificial fillers. Many appreciate
  the family-friendly setup with kid-friendly options and quick service that

  praised for its positive energy and beautiful presentations, a few mentions
  note occasional inconsistencies with specific dishes, though these seem to be
  exceptions rather than the norm. Overall, folks find it a solid pick for
  groups or casual outings, with the attentive staff adding to the welcoming
  feel that encourages repeat visits. If you're on the hunt for reliable sushi
  spots nearby, this place delivers a mostly delightful experience that's worth
