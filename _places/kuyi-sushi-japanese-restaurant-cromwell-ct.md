        First of best thing about this place is that you get served quick and
        they attend well checking up every so often . Sushi here is good but my
        second visit, I got a bento box with steak(being under cooked, very red)
        Server didn’t even ask how I wanted the steak not sure if because they
        are young and don’t understand that yet but yeah , very turned off with
        this visit as well as my wife was . Food came out fast but seemed
        rushed! then the music playing was horrible and explicit for my dinning
        experience 🙃

        First of best thing about this place is that you get served quick and
        they attend well checking up every so often . Sushi here is good but my
        second visit, I got a bento box with steak(being under cooked, very red)

        I had such a wonderful night, our waiter was great and made the
        experience so memorable and everything was delicious.


        Got a Thai iced tea (like 4 of them and took the rest home haha),
        chicken tempura and pork gyoza dumplings for appetizers, and then got
        mushroom soup, shrimp tempura roll, and other things as well that were
        spectacular.


        Just go here. Or better yet, get it delivered!!!!!!


        YOUR STOMACH WILL THANK ME😍

        I understand why the ratings are so high for this place. Ate here on the
        way back to NYC from MA. It was along route and I was surprised by the
        amount of reviews and star count.


        The food really lived up to the expectations set. Myself and my friend
        had 5 rolls total and they were all delicious. I don't remember specific
        names but it spanned from shrimp to salmon to yellowtail.


        Everything was excellent!!

        Where to begin?! They have only been open for a year and service is
        impeccable- friendly, fast. Sushi always tastes great, good size and
        beautifully presented. The place is quite glamorous inside - with
        leather seats and light water fountain, but the atmosphere is casual and
        relaxing. Absolutely recommend for a great dinner experience! They are
        located in the Cromwell Shopping Plaza across the road from Stop & Shop.
