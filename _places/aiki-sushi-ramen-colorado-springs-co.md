        The restaurant looks nice and clean inside. We went weekday during lunch
        and it wasn’t busy at all. They have hibachi seating on one side and
        regular seating on the other. The  service was good, as one would
        expect. The food was okay. We order the bento box, which came with
        plenty of food, but the food was underwhelming. I was expecting the
        salad to be your traditional Japanese shredded cabbage salad with sesame
        dressing, not at all. The miso soup was tasty, the teriyaki chicken is
        your run of the mill teriyaki sauce—nothing special. For what it was the
        price was justifiable ($15 per bento box). The California roll left was
        not what one would expect, it was okay at best.


        Overall, good service, but the food was just okay. I have better hopes
        for the hibachi, which I will go back and try at some point. I’ve had
        teppanyaki in Japan and I’m curious to see how theirs compares so I’m
        looking forward to trying their hibachi grill in the future.

        We decided to take a chance on this place, and it turned out to be just
        okay. Although the restaurant was clean, it was unorganized with random
        supplies in every corner. Ordering was a bit confusing. We were promptly
        served drinks, but it took a while to place our food order. The waitress
        noticed we hadn't ordered yet and spoke to the waiter. She then asked us
        to write our order on a scrap of paper, which added to the confusion.


        We ordered the combo fried rice, spicy miso ramen, tiger roll, and angel
        roll. The meal began with a salad with ginger dressing, which I didn’t
        enjoy, although the salad was fresh.


        The combo fried rice portion was generous and came with a miso soup that
        was overly salty. Unfortunately, the chicken didn’t taste right and some
        of the beef pieces had the same issue. The spicy miso ramen was just
        okay; it lacked a strong miso flavor and the pork was dry, though the
        noodles were nicely chewy.


        The sushi was the highlight of the meal. Both the tiger roll and the
        angel roll matched their menu descriptions and tasted good. The sushi
        chef who brought out our sushi was pleasant and asked if we needed
        anything.


        Overall, the experience was quite disorganized, with staff repeatedly
        asking if certain things had been done, like whether they had brought
        the miso soup or taken our order. I wouldn’t return for the menu dishes,
        but the sushi might warrant another visit.

        We did not enjoy our experience at this place. We dined in. Lazy
        service- we had to write our order on a piece of paper, dirty plates
        were not picked up in a timely manner. Some odd music for the entire
        restaurant came from the server's phone. The food was very unimpressive.
        Pho looked and tasted like it was prepared with spaghetti noodles, which
        is very strange. The prices are way too high for the quality of food. We
        will not return.

        I've shelved my expections on sushi after my timing living abroad, as it
        would not be fair to the restaurant to grade it by those standards in a
        landlocked state.


        However, I was overall disappointed with my experience here. Aiki Sushi
        and Ramen feels like a cafe when stepping in. I was greeted by one of
        the two people behind the sushi bar.


        After sitting and one of the two sushi chefs took my order, I realized
        that the ordering system would be written down. The owner behind the
        cashier counter stood there with little to do but look at the TV. When
        he did bring food, he was extremely soft-spoken.


        I felt like some nigiri, and ordered a few salmon, hokkigai, saba, and
        hotategai.

        I also ordered a veg yakisoba.


        First, my sushi came out. It was smaller, but that was to be expected at
        $1 per piece. The rice was refrigerated and clumpy, and off-putting. As
        far as each fish went, the salmon and hokkigai were okay, and the saba
        was off even with its usual vinegary taste. The hotategai is where I was
        disappointed, as nothing on the menu said that it would be spicy. While
        I do love spicy food, I try to avoid it with sushi, as it taints the
        palate. Luckily, I was saving that for last in this visit.


        For the little bit of soy sauce that I did use, do be careful when
        pouring it out. The containers spill a lot. I lost my napkin to that.


        Miso soup came out during the sushi (as well as the entree).

        The broth was okay. Not overly strong but reliant on miso rather than
        dashi, and I was happy to see soft tofu as well.


        The entree was the star here, taking me back to yatai yakisoba at
        festivals. While the veggies tasted like they were cooked 8n a different
        sauce, the overall slightly tangy savory flavor was wonderful. Having it
        served on a house dinner plate was odd, but it too gave a good feeling.


        I did my best to leave Japan in Japan, but it is places like this that
        make me think why it is okay for us to expect excellent burgers, steak,
        chicken, pizza, etc for a top dollar, yet  we settle for mediocrity when
        it comes to Japanese food.
