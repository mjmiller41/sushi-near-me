        Walked in on a Friday evening for dinner since I have been craving sushi
        and wanted to go somewhere close. They were really busy, but our table
        of 2 was seated quickly. The restaurant was small, but there is an
        option for table or bar seating. We got a table seat and opted for all
        you can eat. The price was $32.99 for dinner.


        For appetizers, we got mussels, seaweed salad, miso soup, and gyoza. The
        seaweed salad, gyoza, and miso soup was good and standard across most
        sushi places. The mussels were really good, but they limit two orders
        per person.


        We usually go for nigiri and a few long rolls. The fish was fresh, but
        the ratio for fish to rice in the nigiri was way off. There is too much
        rice for the amount of fish. If they removed 1/3 of the rice for each
        piece, it would have been perfect. I see they might be adding more rice
        to get you to feel full faster and they can save on the fish. The rolls
        we got were JJ, rainbow, and black tiger. Not very memorable to me.


        They give you the typical wasabi and ginger. The wasabi was spicy which
        I love! There were only two pieces of ginger and it was a good palate
        cleanser so we asked for more.


        The service here is great. All the servers helped each other and on top
        of collecting dirty plates since the tables are very small. They provide
        you with the papers to mark your order and are quick to bring you your
        appetizers.


        This was a good experience, but the ratio of rice and fish in the nigiri
        turned me off and I do not like how they limit orders on the popular
        appetizers especially for the price. They can accommodate larger
        parties, but they only have 1 table for groups larger than 4. Hopefully
        they will adjust the ratio of rice to fish in the nigiri and I will come
        back in the future.

        JJ’s Sushi is an absolute gem! From the moment we walked in, the
        experience was exceptional. The owner was incredibly personable, taking
        the time to check on us and ensure everything was perfect—it’s rare to
        find that level of care. The restaurant itself was spotless, with a warm
        and inviting atmosphere that made us feel right at home.


        What really stood out was how accommodating they were. One of my friends
        is gluten-free, and the owner was so knowledgeable and went above and
        beyond to ensure they were taken care of, offering safe and delicious
        options without any compromise in flavor or quality.


        And the food? Absolutely amazing! Every roll was fresh, flavorful, and
        beautifully presented. You can tell they put thought and passion into
        everything they serve. This is hands down some of the best sushi I’ve
        had. If you’re looking for a clean, friendly spot with outstanding food
        and exceptional service, JJ’s Sushi is it. Highly recommend!

        This was our first time at JJs, Suffice to say it won't be our last. 
        The waitresses were very attentive and cordial. The chefs were fast with
        orders.  The food not only looked good it tasted even better. The Unagi
        and Salmon were both fresh and tasteful.  We had three rolls as well,
        everything just tasted good. My wife and I both commented on the rice
        being cooked perfectly and fresh.  We are by no means rice aficionados
        we just have three rice cookers and lived in Japan for a good amount of
        time. All that aside, when you hear customers come in and are greeted by
        name, it says a lot for the atmosphere of the restaurant.  It was a
        pleasure walking slowly out with a thank you come again from the staff. 
        Love it.

        Very disappointed in the fish to rice ratio, massive amounts of rice
        compared to fish... I read one review that said, "if you like rice, you
        will love this place", that review couldn't be more spot on. food was
        just average at best, atmosphere decent, service good, but when we asked
        the guy at the bar making the sushi, if he could put just a little less
        rice, he said it's a set amount... He was making it himself, so it was
        at his discretion... Again, the amount of rice to fish ratio was almost
        comical in nature, mountain of rice for every piece of nigiri, we won't
        be going back...

        The sushi had a lot of rice. I loved the environment and the sushi
        chef's. The servers were on point. They kept checking in on us
        throughout the night. The mussles we're missing the shell and juice.
        Miso soup was nice and hot. I could tell it was freshly made. The nigiri
        had way to much rice but it was nice they gave you four pieces per
        order. We loved the war roll. Everything else was simple. Small menu.
        Thank you for the experience.
