        The $28.95 all you can eat is worth every single penny. We bring our
        hungry boys and they get their moneys worth every single time. The fish
        is fresh and customizations are very easy to make. We love our servers
        and they make us feel like we’re at home every time we walk in.

        Looking 👀 for an affordable meal for lunch this restaurant is it they
        have all you can eat for $18.99 there one menu for all you can eat and
        everything on it. You can get as much as you want. You just have to eat
        it all the restaurant charges you per one sushi which is a $1.00 that’s
        left on your plate before they put it in. to go box so just be aware of
        that also the restaurant closes at 2:30pm and preparing for dinner. The
        cool thing about it. Is you get to see your sushi being prepared right
        in front of you the kitchen area is in the middle of the restaurant. Our
        was server was not the best server not train. Didn’t know the menu very
        well thank God it’s just sushi. I tried several types of rolls. My
        favorite is the hot girl Rolls had a spicy mango sauce and a crunchy top
        for on the sushi. That was my first time tasting something like that,
        and it was really good. It has shrimp inside of it. They also have fried
        rice and other side items that you could get during this buffet time. I
        decided to try their cocktail menu which they have a bar, but it’s on
        the other side of the wall and try the drunken monkey drink and it was
        really good. It was $10 though overall, I enjoyed my time I was just
        confused to why they charge per item left on your plate. The manager was
        really nice regards to explaining it

        My wife and I came here a few years ago and were not impressed by the
        service but we were on this side of town doing some shopping and I
        really wanted sushi so we decided to to give it another shot. It was a
        great experience! Our server Micheal was very kind and attentive and the
        food came out quickly and was very good. I hate food waste so I really
        appreciate their policy of making people pay if they order more than
        they can eat and having them take the left overs with them.

        $28 all you can eat. 2 hour max. Waste and take-away not allowed.

        15 pieces max on sushi or sashimi. Then it’s a $.75 up charge per piece.

        Good deal if you can eat at least 3 rolls and a few appetizers.

        The waitress was slow and kept bringing me 1 piece of sushi even though
        I wanted 3 pieces at a time.

        Not a bad deal if you are hungry.

        Food was mediocre if you are doing the all-you-can-eat its about $30 per
        person, not including the drink. It was too busy on a Saturday and long
        waits. Some food wouldn't arrive and we had to ask for it a few times.
        Poor sushi choices. The special rolls were not special and small. Just
        being honest is All. The Pepper Tuna was delicious.
