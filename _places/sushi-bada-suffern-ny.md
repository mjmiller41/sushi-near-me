        deluxe is choice imo!), apps (👌Hamachi Truffle: yellowtail, crispy
        onion, scallion, sesame seeds with white truffle soy sauce and avocado
        fries) cocktails, hot sake. Been here a few times and service is usually
        better; service was just ok tbh recently. Had to ask for water a few
        times but otherwise would go back because the food is so good.

        Nice place. I went on Valentines Day and had a reservation. The place
        was crowded, but our server was nice. The sushi was expensive. The
        brussel sprouts were good, and they had great sauce. The calafornia was
        ok and so as the other rolls. The music was nice and the seats were
        comfortable. They had cute decorations on the ceiling.

        we walked in. We’re put on a wait, which was fine even though the host
        asked me if we wanted to put our names on the wait.. after saying we
        would wait however we were not acknowledged at the bar for more than 15
        minutes. We had to stand up and ask for a glass of wine while waiting
        for our table, then we were sat with McKenzie, who changed the whole
        experience. He was super attentive, quick and order accuracy was on
        point great job, McKenzie!!!

        Went in for dinner and it was perfect.

        All the ingredients are super fresh

        For starters ordered

        -Adamame

        -Fried Avocado - the tempura was very light

        -Avocado bomb with spicy salmon filling - beautiful dish, tasty,but I
        would recommend a bit less sweet chili sauce on it


        Mains

        Chefs choice (and the chef made great choices!) :

        -starter:Ceviche with yellow tail,salmon, cucumber,mango in yuzo
        -fresh,light ,great starter

        -second: Sashimi assortment,this was perfect! Very nice combination and
        super fresh,the salmon belly literally melts in your mouth

        -maon: Nigiri assortment - had a nice wasabi kick and again super fresh
        fish ,well made rice


        In addition:

        -Alaskan roll

        -Apple,mango,tuna and cream cheese roll with a lovely hot sauce on top
        (forgot the name of the roll)- had a nice kick to it and the flavor
        combo was surprisingly good

        -sweet potato roll- nice light tempura

        -vegi roll -very fresh


        For dessert we ordered the vanilla ice cream and chocolate mousse cake -
        delicious!


        The service was super quick and nice.

        Plenty of street parking in the area


        Definitely recommend -we all came out very full and very pleased 😄
