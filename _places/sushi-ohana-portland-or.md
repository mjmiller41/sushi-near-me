        I've been to many sushi places in the state of Oregon, especially
        Portland, but this place is just like the others. Just another common
        sushi place. Not bad, not good, but mediocre. It's a place you'd go if
        you're nearby and craving sushi quickly, straight off the train.


        Food: 2/5

        This place hasrubber chicken and mediocre "crab". That sums it up. But,
        if you're just out for a night in the town craving seaweed salad and
        tamago, this is your place. I got the California Roll and Seaweed Salad.
        The California Roll really wasn't anything special, I had better at
        other places. The Seaweed Salad on the other hand was amazing, I'd go as
        far and say delectable. It was juicy and made correctly. My
        acquaintances got the chicken noodles. She said the chicken was dry. I
        had a taste and I agreed, it was also rubbery. My other acquaintance got
        the Seared Salmon and liked it. Obviously the food wasn't anything
        special, but serves its purpose.


        Service: 3/5

        The service here has some really nice and patience waiters. Though there
        is one big thing I need to mention, and the reason I gave it a 3: The
        language barrier. Waiters speak a little bit of English, and had trouble

        trying to hear what my acquaintances were saying, leading to one of them
        getting lemonade, instead of their "Ramune". But, they were very nice
        overall.


        Atmosphere: 4/5

        Besides the "okay" food, the atmosphere was really nice. They had
        Japanese paintings of people, scriptures, and nice lighting. The only
        reason this isn't a 5 is because it feels very cramped inside.

        Delicious sushi for a very competitive price. Loved all the varieties of
        sushi we tried. However didn’t like the Shrimp Udon and Miso soup.
        Service was very very poor. Servers were indifferent to customers and
        behaved very weird. Anything we ordered (that was not on the belt) took
        almost 15 minutes to arrive. Very difficult to find parking. They have a
        few parking spots which are almost always full. We had had to park at a
        free parking which was 3-4 minutes walking distance from the restaurant.

        I love sushi ohana! Great service and food is delicious. Conveyor belt
        style, but also offers call ahead for take out! I live close and always
        call in for pick up. Food is made fresh and ready within 15-20 minutes
        tops! Fun to sit down and eat too. Not a huge indoor seating area but
        can fit quite a bit of customers. Love the poke and all other items on
        the menu. Never had anything I did not like. Highly recommended

        Visiting from out of town and found this gem on Google Maps. Happy hour
        was absolutely a steal! We could not stop talking about how generous the
        salmon portions were, how crispy and lightly battered the calamari was,
        and how fast the service was. The seared salmon was a must try. I
        haven’t seen quality sushi this affordable in at least half a decade. We
        also had 10 people and they seated us within 15 minutes at a busy time.
        People seemed to be in and out fast and efficiently. Highly recommend!
