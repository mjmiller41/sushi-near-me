        We decided to walk from Hard Rock Hotel and this place looked quaint and
        fun. We were greeted by Kia and then we stayed for the entire evening.
        The food was good, the drinks were delish (loved lucky Buddha
        beer-recommended by a local), and absolutely enjoyed the neighborhood
        vibe. Kia was perfect and friendly! Stop by this place to grab a bite to
        eat and meet some great people! ❤️

        The food was cool. I enjoyed my bubble gum sushi roll and sprite. But
        the server/bartender that boasts about being there from Saturday to
        Tuesday, was so rude to my friend and I. As soon as we sat down, we were
        rushed to select an item, followed by very clear body language that
        indicated annoyance and/or agitation. It was odd because the
        server/bartender was so pleasant to every other customer. Just not two
        black women at the bar. If you want to spend money on parking, food, and
        unnecessarily cold service - this is the place to be. 0 out of 10. Never
        again.

        Great wait  staff! The fish is decent. The rice had me close to sending
        it all back to the kitchen. It was overcooked and didn't hold form well
        and had me doubting it's freshness. Their Palermo was crafted well. The
        Telepathy martini is spiked fruit punch. A combo we ordered magically
        cost $5 more than it was on the menu. If you're dying for sushi and it's
        convenient, I think their sashimi and rolls will scratch that itch, but
        it's not impressive. The sake was decent, but overpriced even by
        restaurant standards. It wouldn't take much for the kitchen to make it
        all great. Maybe it was an off day.

        Went here for Valentine's Day with my partner. Awesome little dive bar
        with a laid back atmosphere and super sweet staff. We got three sushi
        rolls and cocktails, and all were to die for. Our calamari appetizer was
        also genuinely the best calamari I've ever had. Definitely give this one
        a try!
