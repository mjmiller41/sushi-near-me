        The quality of a traditional hibachi restaurant at half the price.
        Incredible sushi, sauces, and fried rice. The spicy pineapple fried rice
        is the best and they make a great sushi love boat. Highly recommend.

        They didn’t ask how I wanted my steak and so most of it was overcooked
        to what I would have preferred. I wouldn’t get the dumplings again. My
        salad was watery as if they didn’t dry the lettuce first.

        My first visit was hard to chose what i wanted to order being that there
        is so many choices,which lets me know each time i visit i will have
        plenty of new things to try each time i stop by…


        The atmosphere was good nice an peaceful,talked with both servers about
        they favorite foods to order an which ones was popular amongst
        customers…

        I was very impressed with the preparation of each dish i ordered…

        Food was decently fast being delivered to table,just know when ordering
        deep fred rolls i will be 10/15min wait for them but well worth the
        wait…

        I started out simple with the king tuna roll an deep fried volcano roll
        both are bold with flavor…

        When i come to town this is my healthy choice of place to eat…

        The hibachi was just OK. Better than some, but not great. I would’ve not
        even have thought about leaving any kind of negative review however if
        not for the absolutely horrible service. First of all any Japanese
        steakhouse that doesn’t serve Japanese beer, well, I’ll let you decide.
        The little black girl which was my waitress was not rude in anyway, but
        more concerned about sitting talking to her friend in the booth next to
        me. At least more so than providing service anyway . She listed off
        Beers they had available. I ordered one of those and she brought
        something she hadn’t even listed. Like a good consumer, I drink it and
        shut my mouth. The rest of the time I watch my food come up and sit a
        top the sushi bar for quite a while before her friend pointed out that
        her customers food was ready. Look I’m from out of town and obviously my
        business doesn’t really matter, but I felt like I should leave this
        review in hopes the owner might read it and make changes for future
        customers Are not leaving bad reviews. All the luck to them.

        It was a decent Hibachi.. The waiter wasn't quite on point with the
        service. I had the fried rice and egg roll. Both, in my opinion could
        have been better.
