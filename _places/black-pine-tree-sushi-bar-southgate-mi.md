        We adore this place, everything is always top notch. But... their crab
        sticks, when ordered to-go, are half the order you get at dine in. I
        thought it was a fluke the first time, but I placed a to go order a
        second and third time after we dined in (to bring hime for my son)
        forgetting to check both times, and when I get home.. sure enough, every
        time it's only 5 crab sticks in the to go box.

        We had the best service. She was able to explain the dishes and the
        Sakai. The Obama roll was delicious. The Bulgogi was OK a little sweet,
        but not as garlicky as I have had in the past. The Bipimbap was quite
        bland to me. I will go back for the Obama roll.

        What business doesn't answer their phone DURING business hours?!?! The
        last 3 times I tried to order carryout, they were denying new orders for
        whatever reason--DURING business hours. Online, I tried to put in an
        order right at the deadline because I was having trouble navigating the
        website, and then was denied when I was technically within their time
        frame (they take orders to 8:25 pm and it was 8:25). I quickly tried
        calling, 8 times  and no one ever answered, nor did the voicemail
        confirm that I had reached Black Pine. I left my name and number so I
        could talk to a manager, so we will see if their management cares. I
        would have written them off a long time ago, but their food is good and
        they offer a roll that I cannot find anywhere else. I wonder if they
        even care...

        My daughter and I got a takeout order as our first time eating here. We
        picked it up and drove 25 minutes home.   It tasted so fresh and the
        rice was cooked perfectly (not too sticky). My  8yo daughter loved her
        roll and even said it tasted really fresh.   It reminded me of the sushi
        I would eat in California,  which I haven't felt like I have had since
        moving here 8 years ago.  We got the Christmas roll, dragon roll, and a
        spicy tuna roll.

        Had the following: sweet potato. Angry california, Philadelphia and
        shrimp tempura. Presentation wise, a bunch of roles in a container.
        Taste wise. The seaweed what kind of rubbery. Didn’t really stick at
        all. I have never had sushi fall apart with the use of chopsticks, but
        it happens often. The shrimp tempura had the tail still in it. I have
        had shrimp tempura at many other places, and usually, the entire thing
        was edible- but this has the tail for some reason. The only time I have
        add sushi that included cream cheese and tastes good, was a Godzilla
        role in 2007. It is still the same. The Philadelphia was not… bad but
        not.. something I need to have again. The sweet potato is usually my go
        to, but I I had to guess which one it was, and it didn’t taste like
        others I had before. I am glad a left a tip for the front staff, as they
        were sweet, but I wouldn’t come back here or recommend anyone for this
        place. I am going to have to eat it because I spent close to 30$, but I
        truly regret doing so


        Edit it: Update, I couldn’t finish it all. Other parts of pieces in
        trash, where the remainder of this is going also. Below subpar and so
        mad I chose this place
