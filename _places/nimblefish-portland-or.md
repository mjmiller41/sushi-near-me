        High-end sushi with excellent quality and a personal touch. It's very
        expensive, but that makes sense. Everything we ate was delicious. The
        Taisho was friendly, professional, and explained each dish in detail.
        Not a place for everyday meals, but perfect for a special, intimate
        experience.

        This was the closest to the Edo-style Sushi Omakaze shown in "Jiro
        Dreams of Sushi" I've ever had. It is single nigiri pieces put down in
        front of you every five minutes for an hour and a half. You are expected
        to eat the piece quickly, even while your partner is next in queue to
        get their piece. At first it feels like way too little food, but by the
        end you feel a warm satisfaction.


        I would admit that this style, quantity, and cost is not for everyone,
        and may even anger some who come unprepared, on a fully hungry stomach,
        and stretching their budget.


        All the fish and preparation was of higher quality and delicious balance
        not got from other Sushi places or even making it at home.


        Great for special occasions where the meal is the entire focus of
        evening.

        Had no clue what we were walking into, but this omakase sushi spot was
        awesome...definitely, would wander in all over again. The food was
        awesome, the staff was friendly, and the pacing was on point. It felt
        like an 'experience.' The fish? So fresh and flavorful Iâm still
        thinking about it. Overall, it was an adventure Iâd gladly repeat.

        Hands down the best dinner experience I had on my trip to Portland - and
        I went to Han Oak be Laangbaan so really the bar was high! Intimate but
        approachable setting, great service, and quality fish. Our chef was
        thoughtful and informative without being too overbearing, and we were
        able to have a nice family meal while learning about the ingredients and
        engaging with the experience. Would recommend and will be back! Not
        cheap but worth the price point.

        I went here with three sophisticated ladies. That really has nothing to
        do with the restaurant, but it gives you a sense of who is dining that
        night. The food is delicious. The sushi chefs are incredible. This is a
        place that everybody should go to, I truly have no feedback.


        OK, I wish they wouldâve asked me âdo you like Uniâ because I donât
        really like Uni, but even the Uni piece was delicious .
