        I just moved to Washington a little over 6 months ago and since then
        have been exploring various sushi places trying to find the best one.
        This one definitely takes the cake for the best I’ve been in yet.

        The atmosphere was amazing. The restaurant was a bit crowded but not
        overstimulating or too loud at all. Plenty of space in between seatings
        and a beautiful interior establishment. They sat us in front of the
        sushi bar, the chairs were comfortable, and we were able to view some of
        the unique sushi preparations! For one of the rolls, the chef used a
        huge torch which really added to the ambience.

        They gave us hot towels upon sitting down to clean our hands with and at
        that point, I have to admit, I was scared about what the check would
        look like! But lo and behold, it was seriously the best deal alongside
        the high quality sushi we were served. This is also the first sushi
        place that I was ever tempted to buy a veggie roll at (I LOVE sushi,
        specifically the fish) and I was not disappointed. I’m happy I tried my
        first veggie roll here.


        All in all, my partner and I had a great time and will definitely return
        for many times to come. Give it a try if you’re considering!

        The atmosphere here is surpurb. My family and I had just sat down at
        another restaurant and left for being rushed to order and not being
        important enough for a straw. Here at AJI we were welcomed, greeted and
        respected.  Our hands were cleaned at the table. Pics below. Atmosphere
        was so positive, all staff were nice and attentative.. Food was fresh
        and light and wonderful. Omg I can't wait to return. Highly recommend!

        We had an excellent experience at this restaurant. The sushi was
        outstanding, with generous portions and exceptional flavors. Upon
        arrival, we were welcomed with hot soup and a warm towel—perfect touches
        for colder weather. I highly recommend this spot for anyone craving
        quality Japanese cuisine.

        What a hidden gem. I didn't realize that the interior was so nice and
        the food was amazing. The sashimi rice bowl was the largest I've ever
        had.


        Also hot towels before the meal + miso soup! Legit Asian style services
        💯💯💯😍

        I recently dined at a fantastic sushi restaurant that exceeded my
        expectations. The freshness of the fish was amazing, with each piece
        perfectly prepared and bursting with flavor. I also really love how they
        decorated the dish. 🍣

        The atmosphere was inviting and the staff was so so nice and friendly,
        customer service was like 20/10. I highly recommend trying their
        signature roll Three times Lady and the sashimi Moriwase B, both were
        outstanding. Overall, it's a must-visit for any sushi lover!
