        Most items are delicious. For all you can eat it is worth the value. If
        you don't care for something, then just don't order it again. They don't
        typically charge for uneaten pieces. We tend to only order the cooked
        rolls and they are delicious. The walnut shrimp and sesame balls are
        also our favorites.

        First time at Wonita Suishi wvmy sister and Cousin in from North Woods. 
        Very clean place, in dining.areas and restroom. Welcoming staff to greet
        and seat you. Simple ordering on printed menu. Fill in how many you
        want. Ask questions if you have any We shared pieces, which was nice if
        we hadn't tried before.  Foods met pictures displayed.  Only issue, I
        asked if soy on table was low sodium, server said, (yes that's the soy)
        It wasn't lower sodium. My fault fir not asking for LOW SODIUM soy upon
        entry.  Will revisit again.

        First time dining here and we will definitely be back! We have a very
        large group so we called ahead and made reservations. Everything came
        out fairly quickly so the wait was not long at all. The service was also
        exceptional! There were 2 waiters for our group and both were very
        attentive and patient with us.

        Overall: The quality of the nigiri and rice is low and the server that
        brings the food is rude.


        Food : First, the nigiri had too much rice and made it overbearing
        compared to the fish. The rice was poorly cooked and was very dry. The
        nigiri also had very thinly cut pieces of fish, making it impossible to
        taste the texture. The soft shell crab also had too much breading and
        too little crab. I could barely taste the crab and its texture because
        all I tasted was the grease.


        Service: Our meal started promising in terms of service. The lady that
        ran the front was super nice and explained everything to us in detail.
        However, the other lady that served the food was tremendously rude. She
        gave us an attitude with every order and brought us the check mid-meal,
        when I still had multiple orders left. Next, she made me fill out my
        check before we were done eating. She came around three times asking for
        it when I told her I wasn't done eating. I couldn't believe that we were
        rushed out after only 60 minutes at an all you can eat.


        Overall, this meal was super disappointing. The quality wasn't great and
        the waiter that brought out the food was really rude. For actual sushi
        lovers that care about food quality, I simply cannot recommend it.

        We've been coming here since we moved to Wisconsin 2 years ago, it's our
        favorite date night spot. Tonight we realized that we were long overdue
        to review this place. I'll cut a long story short because I'm so stuffed
        and want to take a nap now: The service is excellent, super quick and
        friendly. The restaurant is very clean, the food is delicious, and the
        atmosphere is pretty dang nice, too. The portions are (obviously)
        generous; they don't do that thing where they load each piece of sushi
        up with a ton of rice to fill you up to save money, what I'm getting at
        here is that the price is absolutely right. I feel like it's got the
        highest calorie to dollar to quality ratio almost anywhere in the state
        (and I'm serious about the C:D:Q ratio. We live hand to mouth). 5/5, and
        not just for the price point. Thank you Wonita Sushi Seafood and Bar for
        our lives.


        P.S. they're not listed, but you've got to try their pan seared salmon
        and red bean ice cream!
