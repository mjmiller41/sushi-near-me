        We came if I’m a very hot day. It was so cool and we sat at the bar
        right away. I got a sea weed salad and it was so good. It was perfectly
        cold and the sea weed salad was so good my wife who hates sea weed salad
        wouldn’t stop eating mine so I got another one 😂. Love the vibe and the
        music definitely worth stopping by on a hot phx evening.

        The sushi was amazing as well. It was so good we ate it before I could
        snap a flic.

        definitely not authentic sushi .i was so disappointed ☹️  but the white

        We like to eat like we live in NYC or Europe, 8p or later, so we often
        go to Moira after the nearby theatre because it is open later than most
        restaurants.  When we arrived last night after a show, around 9:00p, it
        was filled with like-minded people and was still going strong, and
        people were still arriving when we left around 10p.  And it’s not just
        because they’re open late.  The place has a trendy, moody vibe, friendly
        and helpful service, and, best of all, the food is Japanese, and good,
        and it’s not sushi-centric (Japanese cuisine has SO much more to offer
        than raw fish). There is a long list of Happy Hour bar bites (cooked),
        maki, and temaki (handrolls), which begins at 9p on Saturday night (till
        2a!).  Happy Hour is 5p to 11p Mon-Thursday and 10:30 to 2a on Friday,
        which probably means tables or counter seats are harder to get late on
        Friday nights.   Although they offer sushi and sashimi, we satisfied
        ourselves at two prime counter seats from the Happy Hour and Izakaya
        (which means Japanese pub) parts of the menu.  The menu also has a Hot
        Kitchen section, which are things like noodles and Yakisoba.  I really
        like the boneless tori (chicken) kara-age (deep fried) boneless bites
        (Happy Hour or Izakaya parts of the menu).  We also enjoyed the
        Niku-Ishiyaki (grill — yaki— yourself meat — Niku, in this case very
        thinly sliced beef), which included some veggies.  It makes a firey
        presentation.  Suggestion: use some other fire source, like sterno.  The
        oil flame burns out too quickly, which forces re-lights (2 for us) and
        pressured us to eat this dish faster than we wanted to.  Another
        suggestion:  more non-nigori sake.  The Hakutsuru Junmai (made with only
        rice, koji, and water) Namachozo (partially unpasteurized) was very
        tasty, but it would have been nice to have other cold, non-nigori
        choices.   The food was excellent, as always, and we’ll be back after
        the next show.

        Great prices for happy hour food and drink options. Been here a few
        times with my family and they never disappoint. Try the coconut shrimp
        and the pork gyoza. For rolls I recommend the dragon.

        We got an order to go. The food was delicious but they didn’t include
        anything but the food. No napkins, no chopsticks, no forks, no wasabi,
        no soy sauce. It was kind of weird. Fortunately the hotel had a fork so
        we could eat our yakisoba! I couldn’t find any menu online so I took
        pictures and uploaded for the benefit of all.
