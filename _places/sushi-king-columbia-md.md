        They created a very genuine setting to enjoy a creative selection of
        sushi. They have classics as well as special rolls.  They offer a nice
        variety of vegetarian options as well.  The service is wonderful and
        they truly make you feel like a king while there.

        I took myself out for sushi because I had not eaten, and I was
        celebrating a big win. I had held off eating.

        So I was greeted nicely, very warmly. I was seated in a booth and
        promptly asked if I would like anything to drink. So I can put away a
        lot of food, especially when I have not eaten. And I ordered a lot,
        probably more than I needed to eat, but I didn’t really care because I
        was hungry. And celebrating. Well, the lady who took my order said,
        well, you’re hungry, huh? 😂 now I didn’t take that in the wrong way,
        but maybe somebody else would.  So next time you might want to keep that
        observation to yourself, because you really don’t know what that person
        might be going through. In my case, I was happy, but sometimes people
        eat too much or they’re just really hungry,  and it’s no one’s
        business,  and no one should really comment on that.

        It just kind of rubbed me the wrong way a little bit, because it sounded
        judgmental .

        After I finished, and believe me, the food was outstanding, I was asked
        if I wanted a check. No one asked me if I wanted dessert.  So I went
        somewhere else for dessert, but I would’ve liked to have felt welcome
        enough to order dessert there. I guess I had already eaten too much. Lol

        Anyway, you live, and you learn. I can tell you I’ve never had an owner
        or waitstaff ask me something like that. But I’m still giving you a five
        star review because everyone says something that could be taken the
        wrong way from time to time.

        My experience was absolutely fantastic! The atmosphere was bustling with
        energy, especially since it was the lunar new year, making it feel even
        more vibrant and lively. I particularly loved the sashimi; it was
        incredibly fresh and artfully presented, just melting in my mouth. The
        service was impressively swift, which added to the overall enjoyment of
        my meal, allowing me to savor each delightful bite without long waits in
        between.

        put it on my regular sushi restaurant already 🍣


        food is sooo good here，Salmon is very fresh and big😋

        King crab in the double six Roll is incredible delicious. So many things
        deserve a try!


        server and sushi chef are friendly, we sat at the bar last night, the
        chef kindly introduced the rolls, sushi and sauce. And gave us two fried
        shrimp for free!😌


        Its better to come on weekend night, Fri and SAT are too busy and you
        may have to wait for some service and food too long.


        come, I am sure you will like it!
