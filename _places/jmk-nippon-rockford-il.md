        Been coming here for many years, and the food is still very delicious! I
        got the filet mignon dinner with fried rice. The soup and salad were
        great as usual. The chef was very fun and made lots of jokes and did
        awesome tricks. The waiter was great too and very attentive. The filet
        was cooked perfectly and the fried rice and vegetables were amazing. The
        yucky yucky sauce is definitely my favorite. It was a bit chilly inside
        and very smoky, maybe they need to clean out their fans?

        Nice place and clean, but the food not so good and poorly presented and
        lack attention to detail. My nuguri  was thick sliced and my sushi roll
        looked like I rolled it at home, it is over priced. My wife's meal was
        on the better side as she had tempura shrimp and she liked it. This
        place fills up fast so go early.

        Great mix of food from Hibachi, to Sushi to steaks. The Surg and Turf
        roll is a must try. Always a great experience!

        On the recommendation from a dear friend, we made the drive from Kenosha
        to Rockford to try JMK. It WAS worth the trip for sure. Everything was
        great about this place. The sushi options are amazing and very
        flavorful. I want to give 5 stars straight across the board. My only
        complaint, which some people might not agree with me on, is the size of
        the pieces of sushi. With food, generally, bigger is better. Not so much
        with sushi. The rolls were so big that I had to cut the piece in half
        just to eat it. (And, I admit, I have a big mouth, lol) I have never had
        to do this before & I didn’t like it. I like being able to take one
        whole piece and eat the whole piece. Sounds like first world problems, I
        know, sorry. But, that’s part of the experience of eating sushi, in my
        opinion. If they could tighten up those rolls a little more, it would be
        5 stars. Overall, a great place for sushi. I would recommend them to
        anyone. Just be prepared for the extraordinary sushi roll sizes…Enjoy!
