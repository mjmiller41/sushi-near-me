        My husband and I stopped by this place since it was right near the
        Tattered Cover bookstore, and we were getting hungry. We got our food to
        go. The food here is AMAZING.


        I got the spring rolls, and I am not joking when I say they were the
        best spring rolls I've had in my entire life.. by far. I didn't even
        know I could *love* a spring roll instead of just liking it. I have no
        idea what made the rolls here so different - the batter, the ingedients,
        something else - but they were absolutely delicious.


        I really loved my Royal Potato Roll as well - so delicious, and it has
        avocado inside and also fresh avocado slices on top. It comes with a
        roasted beet sauce that I got on the side since I don't always like
        sauces, but I ended up eating the entire container's-worth that they
        gave me.


        My husband got the Love in the Edo roll (with vegan teriyaki beef). He
        hasn't tried it yet since he's driving, but it looks beautiful. If I'm
        able to, I'll edit after he eats. [Edit: he did eat the sushi after it
        sat in a warm car for 5 hours, but he still said it was "pretty darn
        good" and that he'd get it again.]


        It's clear the people working here put a lot of care and effort into the
        food. It wasn't quick to get our food, but the wait was highly worth it.
        Definitely try this place out if you want a wonderful meal.

        Delicious sushi! So many variety rolls we had a hard time deciding. We
        ended up ordering 4 rolls and loved all of them! The Ohnagi and Tokyo
        drift rolls were our favorite, but the smoky sake and Ebi tempura rolls
        were a close second. Update, we ordered a second time because it was
        that good. This time we chose the Hot Flamingo Roll, the Smoky Sake
        Roll, Tokyo Drift Roll and Love in the Edo. These 4 rolls are now our
        favorites. It is great to find vegan sushi that is creative, delicious
        with great flavors! We will be ordering again.

        The place is so underrated for its delicious vegan sushi and ramen!
        Although all options are vegan, it tastes just like the real deal if not
        better.

        I’ve ordered the hot flamingo roll and a bowl of shoyu ramen, the fried
        onion on top is so good, flavorful and crispy.

        The staff are all friendly and attentive.

        The only little detail I’ve noticed that could use some improvement on
        is the floor is a bit greasy and slippery.

        Potential for better, you can tell the rolls are made by professionals.

        Out of 4 rolls I really liked 2, especially the smoked one.

        Two of them had too much toppings of crunch and mayo, which made the
        taste of the real roll underpowered.

        Overall I recommend it and will go back.

        4 stars because all vegan (200% plant based) otherwise might be lower.
        Food was mostly good some dishes better than others. The vegan ramen was
        excellent and recommended. Hospitality and ambiance could use a little
        bit more attention but overall food quality was good and I would return
        to eat here. Curry rice was delicious too. And mushroom stuff fried tofu
        was a crowd favorite.
