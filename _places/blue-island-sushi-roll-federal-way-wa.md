        Went in a late lunch on Sunday. Not too busy when we walked in.The
        seating area was clean. Typical conveyor belt items. You can order fresh
        as well. I did see a few items circle for a long duration, I skipped
        those. There were some items without a cover, I skipped those too. I did
        see staff refresh the items within acceptable intervals. The prices are
        good. The food tastes good. I asked for ginger and got a good serving.
        The food is presented well. The staff is welcoming. I ate, I was happy,
        my tummy was happy after 2+hrs of leaving. I will be going back.

        I had been wanting to eat here for a long time because I absolutely love
        sushi. I come from Vancouver Canada and it's home to some of the best
        Asian food in the world so a lot of places in Washington don't compare
        but this restaurant is definitely on my list of top sushi places. I've
        had conveyor sushi at other locations around town but usually the
        quality, flavours and/or freshness is an issue but not here.

        The service is excellent, the atmosphere is pretty mellow and the prices
        are fantastic.

        I really enjoyed their crab salad filling it had a very nice sweet,
        clean, fresh flavour and the Unagi was torched perfectly and has that
        fantastic charred flavour that I love. The spring rolls and tempura were
        fried perfectly, everything was fresh and they restock the conveyor
        frequently but you can also order from the menu. The prices here are
        also totally reasonable and was about $30/person including tip and
        believe me we stuffed out faces.

        I can't wait to come back
