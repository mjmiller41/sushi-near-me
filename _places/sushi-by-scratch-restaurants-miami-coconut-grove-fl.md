        Some of the most unique sushi combination I’ve ever had! I really
        enjoyed the experience and there wasn’t one piece of nigiri I didn’t
        love. The only downside to the 7:15 reservation is they definitely are
        rushing to get you out in time for them to reset and prep for the 9:30
        reservation so we didn’t have the option for any extenders. I wish the
        chefs engaged our group a bit more since it was more of an intimate
        setting and everyone talked amongst their groups mostly until the end
        when we all had had some drinks in us. Additionally had some louder
        people who made it difficult to hear the bartender talk about the
        pairing and the chef had to even ask them to stop talking at one point.
        Overall, I’d still say it was a top experience and highly recommend for
        sushi lovers.

        We had an excellent experience at Sushi by Scratch! The quality of fish
        was premium and we enjoyed the sake pairings immensely curated by the
        sommelier. 17 courses of deliciousness with a variety of flavors. We
        left with full tummies and a smile on our faces.

        We loved the darker, intimate vibe, and music. We really felt as if we
        were dining in secret! The experience is what you make of it, so I’d
        recommend interacting with the other diners and the lovely chefs and
        sommelier. We learned interesting facts about their crafts simply by
        asking the team who seemed happy to share. The welcome hostess was also
        incredibly inviting.

        It’s an experience and I would recommend it to my friends! I will say, I
        know not everyone may be willing to pay the price (with the add ons, it
        racks up). But if you’re in a position to do so, go for it! It’s a
        delicious meal and a wonderful experience.

        If you're a sushi fanatic, then this place is for you! It's a hidden
        restaurant in Coconut Grove, where you enter through a secret door and
        arrive at an exclusive room with a capacity of around 12 people.

        The fish is incredibly fresh and the ingredients are truly gourmet. They
        prepare the sushi rolls right in front of you, and I personally chose to
        have them made without rice, except for a few that the chef recommended.
        Reservations are necessary before going.

        The hostess give you a welcome with sake.

        It’s very pricy, but exclusive.
