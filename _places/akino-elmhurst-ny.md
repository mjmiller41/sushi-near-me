        Recently came back here with my friend and honestly, you can’t ask for
        more it’s super delicious. The fish seems fresh and you can see the
        sushi chef’s right there cutting and slicing everything. I’d say the
        portions for the appetizers and stuff on the menu are kind of small but
        it makes sense. Our waiter attended us maybe once or twice but I like
        that since we don’t have to be interrupted. Overall, it’s such a nice
        place. I think it could be a little more affordable, but you can’t
        really beat the price when it comes to 2025.

        more it’s super delicious. The fish seems fresh and you can see the
        sushi chef’s right there cutting and slicing everything. I’d say the
        portions for the appetizers and stuff on the menu are kind of small but
        it makes sense. Our waiter attended us maybe once or twice but I like
        that since we don’t have to be interrupted. Overall, it’s such a nice
        place. I think it could be a little more affordable, but you can’t
        really beat the price when it comes to 2025.

        I’ve came here several times when Akino had the outdoor seating in the
        parking lot and also experienced the indoor seating. The outdoor seating
        was a bit uncomfortable, so glad they got rid of it.


        The service has been pretty good. I’ve never had an issue except for the
        time I found something in my water and asked for a new one. The food
        itself is good! I love the variety of menu items and no limit on sashimi
        is great.


        This is one of the only two Japanese spots I go to in the area. I would
        recommend this spot to anyone visiting Elmhurst or craving for sushi and
        sashimi or even for a special occasion.

        There are a couple reasons why I rated this place so low. Mainly just
        centered on pricing alone. For nearly $50!! which is what you have to
        pay for if you want the buffet special you get access to their entire
        list of sushi rolls which they have plenty of options which I will give
        them added points for variety on the menu. Their takeout boxes are crazy
        priced as in you can get a few signature rolls or so for their least
        price which would be close to $25 and trust me you won’t be filled on
        that. If you waste any food they will add that to your bill depending on
        what was ordered specifically and what quantity. If you want to take any
        leftovers home I believe it would $20 to your bill as well. They add
        gratuity as not a tip but a mandatory payment on your bill. The place is
        also kind of squished together as in not much place to bring your family
        or group of friends if you want to dine in since it’s always busy. There
        are a handful of people cooking and working the joint so at least the
        wait time is not bad 5-10 mins tops depending on what you ordered. You
        have to circle everything you want on a menu before you order and be
        careful as in buffets you tend to fill up much faster then anticipated.
        Circle a few things you can handle eating so you avoid any extra fees
        and if you want to eat more you can do so by asking for another menu.
        They do have soju as well as some drinks on the bar.

        Took the boys out tonight for some of the best sushi in NYC! Akino
        (82-80 Broadway, Elmhurst, NY 11373)We went here at around 5PM and the
        place was very busy for early dinner. I can imagine how busy this place
        can get during the weekends

        The sushi was so good and their dinner menu

        included unlimited sashimi. My sons loved everything from the soup,the
        rolls, tempura, and sashimi. Go with a big group so

        you get to try more things. I went mainly for the

        sashimi salmon and it is out of this world. Great quality fish and
        fresh. It is where every meal is a journey of flavor and culture. Highly
        Recommended! #akino #Queens

        Made reservations in advance for a party of 8 on a Saturday evening. Our
        table was ready as we got there and they have a time limit of 2 hrs.
        Very efficient AYCE ordering system, where you write down the number of
        plates you want for each respective item. We HAD to get their sashimi
        pieces, which were thinly sliced and very fresh! We DOWNED the platter
        in 10 min LOL Reasonably priced AYCE prices for lunch + dinner as well,
        considering their quality.


        Service is great as well! They also have a newly built section, which
        was bright and clean. Highly recommend if you're in the Elmhurst area,
        but be sure to make reservations in advance as it's a very popular spot!
