        Located in the Gaslamp Quarter, Nobu San Diego brings the brand’s iconic
        blend of Japanese cuisine with Peruvian influences to a sleek, modern
        space. The ambiance is upscale yet approachable, with dim lighting,
        polished interiors, and a lively energy that makes it ideal for both
        date nights and group dinners.


        The menu features Nobu’s signature dishes like the Black Cod Miso,
        Yellowtail Jalapeño, and the crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura, along with a
        variety of sushi, sashimi, and creative small plates. The quality is
        consistently high, with fresh ingredients and elegant presentation
        across the board.


        Service is polished and attentive, and the bar program offers
        well-crafted cocktails and a strong sake selection to complement the
        food. While it carries the global Nobu name, the San Diego location
        feels well integrated into the local dining scene, offering a
        dependable, stylish night out in the heart of downtown.


        Would strongly budget around $150/pp for a full course meal with tax and
        tip.

        It’s been a while since I visited Nobu. Today, with my kids at a
        neighbor’s, my husband and I decided to stop by for a quick snack and a
        hot sake. Nobu has always been a great spot for food, and my last visit
        was before the pandemic. This time, I realized that for two people,
        spending at least $300-$500 is recommended if you want to fully enjoy
        the meal and atmosphere. Without it, you might miss out on the
        experience.


        Overall, Nobu is still a great place, but to truly appreciate it, a
        proper budget is needed.

        The Nobu restaurant in San Diego impressed us with its exquisite menu
        and beautiful atmosphere – the food was absolutely amazing, and the
        setting created the perfect vibe for a great dinner. However,
        unfortunately, the service left a lot to be desired. We were celebrating
        my friend’s birthday and ordered a dessert for her, but it was never
        brought to the table. When I ordered a dessert for myself, it arrived
        with a candle and a birthday greeting, which felt odd since it was my
        friend’s birthday. When we spoke to the waiter, we were told that they
        only offer ice cream, but even that was never brought for my friend.


        During dinner, another incident occurred: after we had finished our
        appetizers and went to the restroom, the staff asked us to leave our
        credit cards at the table, as if they suspected we might “skip out.” We
        had left all our belongings, including expensive bags, at the table,
        which felt very disrespectful. The manager not only didn’t try to smooth
        things over but sided with the waiter, which left a bad impression.


        While the food and atmosphere were definitely praiseworthy, the service
        was disappointing, and these moments really tarnished the overall
        experience.

        Favorite dishes - San Diego sea urchin, Bluefin Tuna Tacos, House
        special roll.

        Wouldn’t recommend- yellowtail jalapeño, spicy crispy rice & shishito
        peppers.

        Premium Nobu sake we order two bottles because we love sake but it’s
        overpriced.

        Staff was amazing, friendly hostess and efficient server. We had a good
        time but just not a place I would recommend it, there’s better sushi
        places in SD.

        Great experience and good/great food. Highly recommend the Prime Beef
        Toban Yaki and the Lychee Elderflower Martini. I'm not a huge beef
        person, but my husband got the dish, and it was delicious. The Lychee
        Martini was perfect, best drink I've had in a while very smooth and not
        overly sweet but not bitter/sour either. As a virgin drink, the Lychee
        Passionfruit and Pineapple was also really delicious. A couple of
        friends had the Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna and it was really good as
        well. I would recommend the Mushroom soup over the Miso with Tofu, sadly
        I wasn't that impressed with the Miso. The Shrimp and Lobster Spicy
        Lemon Sauce was okay, not overly impressed, nor with the Shrimp Tempura
        sushi rolls. Personally, I think it was way overly hyped over the taste,
        presentation, quality. I may have just had unrealistic expectations or
        wrong choices but definitely would go back for the really good items. I
        just expected everything to be mind-blowing.
