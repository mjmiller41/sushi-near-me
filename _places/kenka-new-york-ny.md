        Absolutely loved it. Went thursday night and there was a huge line out
        the door. They take your name and the number of people in your party and
        the line moved rather quickly and we got inside.


        I got the agedashi tofu and it was heavenly. The tofu's seared on the
        outside but it was also cooked all the way through and was very soft and
        hot on the inside.


        I also ate the edamame which i liked very much and my friend got the
        udon noodles with chicken and said they were great as well.


        Staff was very nice and food arrived quickly. I wouldn't go on a
        thursday night again though because it was packed and really loud but
        that's not the establishment's fault.

        A friend recommended this place to me, and I definitely suggest giving
        it a try! It can get really busy, so be prepared to wait around 10-30
        minutes. They tend to prioritize larger groups since most of their
        seating is set up for that, but they do have a few tables for two as
        well—just not as many. When we arrived, there were already a lot of
        people there, but since we were a group of four, we got seated right
        away.


        The food is incredibly affordable, with almost everything priced under
        $10, and it tasted great! Just a quick note—if you order the soups or
        udon, they might not be as filling compared to some of the other dishes.
        It’s a fantastic spot to hang out with friends, but keep in mind that it
        can get pretty loud—that’s just part of the restaurant’s vibe.


        One of the coolest parts is that when you’re done eating, you get to
        make your own cotton candy outside using their machine! For reference,
        we had four dishes, two appetizers, and two alcoholic drinks, and the
        total came to $70 for four people.

        This is a cool and fun place to have drinks with friends who like
        drinking, but little inappropriate for little kids. 😅The price is very
        affordable - where else can we find a place that sells craft beer for
        only $1.50. Can’t wait to try their Nabi and Tuna Bone next time. 😍

        This is the worst restaurant I’ve experienced in New York so far.


        It was so terrible that it felt like experiencing anti-Asian
        discrimination at a Japanese restaurant.


        From the beginning, despite there being plenty of seats inside, we were
        seated near the entrance. When we mentioned that the potato salad seemed
        spoiled, the staff showed no apology or response, instead giving us an
        incredulous look, taking the salad away, and throwing it out. There was
        no follow-up regarding the salad, so we had to ask again, only to be
        told that it was our taste that was strange, without any apology.


        Every time we tried to place an order, we were ignored. Had we been
        satisfied with the service, we would have tipped accordingly, but given
        the treatment we received, we didn’t feel compelled to leave a tip. As
        we were leaving, the staff tapped on the receipt with a pen and
        mockingly asked, “Two dollars?” I told them I was dissatisfied with
        their service and left.


        However, when my friend realized they had left their phone behind and
        returned to retrieve it, the staff held the phone as if it were a
        hostage and aggressively demanded to know why we didn’t leave a tip,
        saying 20% is the standard.


        I remember the staff member involved very clearly, but I will not
        mention their appearance.


        Two years ago, when I first came to New York, I had good memories of
        this restaurant, so I brought my friends along, but it has now become a
        terrible memory. While the food was decent, the service was absolutely
        appalling.


        I will never visit this restaurant again, and you’re free to blacklist
        me if you’d like—I don’t care. However, I strongly recommend properly
        training your staff, as this kind of behavior is unacceptable when
        dealing with customers.

        Honestly so disappointed. This place has been on my list for a while and
        I was so excited to check it out. However, the whole experience wasn't
        pleasing. Food- okay good thing it's cheap. However i'd rather pay more
        and eat better quality food. The place is so crowded and loud despite
        the fact that it was a weekday dinner. I didn't even know who my server
        was. They didn't bring water, not to mention getting refilled. I am
        wondering how sanitary the place is. Although you can get diversity of
        food and the whole system is fast paced, wouldn't recommend. Lucky cat i
        believe the one in the upper east is way better. Overall so
        disappointed..

  What Visitors Are Saying$$$Visitors often praise KENKA for its tasty,
  budget-friendly Japanese dishes that make for a satisfying meal, especially
  when shared with friends in its lively setting. Many highlight the great value
  and variety, like the flavorful udon and appetizers that hit the spot without
  emptying wallets, creating a fun vibe reminiscent of a classic izakaya. While
  the energetic atmosphere and quick service on busy nights add to the
  excitement, some note that crowds can lead to longer waits or occasional
  service slowdowns that are worth navigating for the overall experience. All in
  all, it's a solid pick for anyone seeking top-rated Japanese fare in the city,
  as long as you go in expecting a bustling scene. If you're hunting for
  Japanese restaurants near me, this place offers a memorable mix of
  affordability and flavor that keeps the good times rolling.
