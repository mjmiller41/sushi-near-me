        DO NOT COME HERE!


        I got some take out pretty late at night as I was craving sushi and I
        was not impressed. For one, I got the spicy salmon roll with cucumbers
        and I got a shrimp tempura roll. I also ordered a spicy miso soup. For
        the price of $22.10, it’s not bad. Sushi is always a bit on the pricier
        side, so for 2 rolls and a soup, it’s not bad. But, I am extremely
        disappointed in particularly the shrimp tempura roll. What happened to
        shrimp tempura roll being shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumbers, etc? Now,
        it seems like all of these sushi restaurants are trying to skimp out on
        the extras and be cheap with what they consider a shrimp tempura roll.
        Rolls don’t just have 1 ingredient/filling. It’s ridiculous. The spicy
        salmon roll was good, but it literally was just salmon and cucumbers… Am
        I crazy? What is happening to sushi restaurants and them skimping out on
        so much? The menu items are so literal with no other fillings. It’s
        exhausting and lowkey a scam. The spicy miso soup was very good though.
        That, I enjoyed. Other than the food, the place was clean (I picked up
        my food) and the service was nice and fast. Would not be going to again
        unless I’m craving sushi really badly at 1 am. The only good thing about
        this place is how late it opens on some days — that’s it. The sushi, not
        that great and a scam.


        Edit: Drop another star because the owner’s response is crazy and rude.
        Do better 😊 and to respond to your insane reply, no other sushi
        restaurant calls it “crazy maki.” I’ve literally been sushi in boston
        since I was born (because I was born here). I’m not about to let some
        mid their sushi restaurant gaslight me into thinking that normal shrimp
        tempura is called “crazy maki.” Sir, that’s crazy. Have a nice life 😘

        and I got a shrimp tempura roll. I also ordered a spicy miso soup. For
        the price of $22.10, it’s not bad. Sushi is always a bit on the pricier
        side, so for 2 rolls and a soup, it’s not bad. But, I am extremely
        disappointed in particularly the shrimp tempura roll. What happened to
        shrimp tempura roll being shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumbers, etc? Now,
        it seems like all of these sushi restaurants are trying to skimp out on
        the extras and be cheap with what they consider a shrimp tempura roll.
        Rolls don’t just have 1 ingredient/filling. It’s ridiculous. The spicy
        salmon roll was good, but it literally was just salmon and cucumbers… Am
        I crazy? What is happening to sushi restaurants and them skimping out on
        so much? The menu items are so literal with no other fillings. It’s
        exhausting and lowkey a scam. The spicy miso soup was very good though.
        That, I enjoyed. Other than the food, the place was clean (I picked up
        my food) and the service was nice and fast. Would not be going to again
        unless I’m craving sushi really badly at 1 am. The only good thing about
        this place is how late it opens on some days — that’s it. The sushi, not
        that great and a scam.


        Edit: Drop another star because the owner’s response is crazy and rude.
        Do better 😊 and to respond to your insane reply, no other sushi
        restaurant calls it “crazy maki.” I’ve literally been sushi in boston
        since I was born (because I was born here). I’m not about to let some
        mid their sushi restaurant gaslight me into thinking that normal shrimp
        tempura is called “crazy maki.” Sir, that’s crazy. Have a nice life 😘

        I can definitely say that it was the worst restaurant I have ever been
        to in Boston. The food was very tasteless. When I told the waiter that I
        did not like the food, he called his chef. The chef came to the table
        and scolded me. Later, when I wanted to use the restroom, the staff said
        that the restroom was closed. I said that I saw people using the
        restroom just before me. However, they did not let me use the restroom.
        I asked why they did this and the same chef came again and pushed me. He
        touched me and pushed me out of the place. It was the worst experience I
        have ever had. Such rudeness is unacceptable, I definitely do not
        recommend it to anyone.

        Beautifully presented and very very tasty maki, chirashi, and poke bowl!
        They have a very large selection and the portions were also good. We
        devoured all of it so quickly!


        Even though I got takeout, the presentation is picture perfect, so I’m
        sure it would be even more beautiful dining in.


        Highly recommend trying this sushi place. I’m excited to come back!

        Always love the food I get from here. The sushi bowls are delicious and
        you get more for the price compared to other places.
