        Hungry Sumo is a great place to experience a bit of Asian fusion and
        really dig into an extensive menu featuring Thai and Japanese cuisine.
        We went early as they did not take reservations, and it certainly was
        bustling when we went on a Thursday early evening. This place is well
        known for its fast table service and attentive wait staff, and they
        certainly delivered on hot, flavorful plates of food. We particularly
        enjoyed the pork bao buns, especially the spicy (but not too hot)
        mustard-like sauce that accompanied the perfectly soft and pillows bao
        buns! The sushi was amazing! Some of the best in Milwaukee, we feel!
        Fresh vegetables that crunch and pair well nestled in perfectly stick
        rice and seaweed wraps! We loved the sauce pairings with the raw fish
        and really enjoyed the contemporary rolls! Try the Lady Marmalade... it
        was spicy and sweet and tasted amazing with the raw salmon.  It was a
        wonderful place to visit, and we will go back again to try the Thai and
        Ramen dishes!

        Hungry Sumo is a great place to experience a bit of Asian fusion and
        really dig into an extensive menu featuring Thai and Japanese cuisine.
        We went early as they did not take reservations, and it certainly was
        bustling when we went on a Thursday early evening. This place is well
        known for its fast table service and attentive wait staff, and they
        certainly delivered on hot, flavorful plates of food. We particularly
        enjoyed the pork bao buns, especially the spicy (but not too hot)
        mustard-like sauce that accompanied the perfectly soft and pillows bao
        buns! The sushi was amazing! Some of the best in Milwaukee, we feel!
        Fresh vegetables that crunch and pair well nestled in perfectly stick
        rice and seaweed wraps! We loved the sauce pairings with the raw fish
        and really enjoyed the contemporary rolls! Try the Lady Marmalade... it
        was spicy and sweet and tasted amazing with the raw salmon.  It was a
        wonderful place to visit, and we will go back again to try the Thai and
        Ramen dishes!

        Staff very friendly, and as accommodating as possible.  Plenty of both
        traditional and contemporary decor.  Sushi is super fresh.  Prices just
        a tad on the higher side.  Even weekday lunch, tables are in demand.

        The food hit the spot.

        The waitress was very attentive. Very pleasant. Even tho a customer had
        a coat hanging on the floor, tripped our server who crashed to the
        ground. She stayed sweet and smiling, started off by asking if we had
        any food allergies to be concerned about. (And yes, there are so many
        places where when asking about egg we sometimes get the oddest looks.
        Today no one with an egg allergy was with us….) I had hot sake for the
        first time. It was different but I enjoyed it. I had hot tea as well. I
        got chicken dumplings and spicy miso ramen. It was great. It had a hint
        of smoky flavor too. It was pretty busy, I feel like this place is
        popular and I was lucky to get in. It was about 12:30 on Saturday.

        I absolutely love this restaurant, I’ve been going here to eat since I
        was 7 (when it opened) the owners are incredibly sweet and amazing along
        with the staff who are also super friendly. On the terms of the actual
        food, you can’t go wrong. Genuinely everything on the menu is exquisite.
        The very crunchy roll is one of their classics that I’ve been ordering
        for ages, it’s a deep fried creamy roll and it’s absolutely perfect.
        Their sushi plates are decadent and have beautiful presentation. I
        highly recommend the pork buns, and tonkotsu ramen. Additionally, over
        the years as I’ve watched this place grow they are very cultured, and
        the atmosphere is very pleasant and clean, I love all their decorations
        and highly recommend going!! I hope this place stays open forever 💕

        The staff are amazing and very friendly. The ramen was creamy with large
        portions of pork and to be honest I'd go back just to have those pork
        steam buns again.
