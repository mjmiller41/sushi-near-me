        My first time trying this place and I had a good experience overall. The
        food was a good as it could be for Colorado. I tried the Rocco,
        California and shrimp tempura rolls. The Rocco roll was really good. I
        love the decor and lighting, it felt beach type and romantic. We also
        had a nice server who provided good suggestions. I would highly
        recommend this place. The only thing to be aware of is that you do have
        to wait a little bit for your food to be served( that’s why the 4 stars
        on food). Went on a Friday night and was fortunate to get seated right
        away.

        Sushi Row is a great addition to Colorado Springs’ downtown dining
        scene. This intimate and gorgeous decorated sushi spot offers a fun mix
        of menu items, varying from temaki tacos, crispy rice, buns, nigiri, and
        maki rolls. Favorite dishes of the night were the crispy sushi rice
        pieces and spicy salmon temaki taco.


        🍹Basic B (Vodka, Passion Fruit, Vanilla Chai,

        Prosecco)

        🌮 Temaki Tacos (Choice of Spicy Tuna, Spicy Yellowtail, Spicy Scallops,
        Spicy Salmon, Spicy Avocado, Baked Crab, Spicy Tuna + Shrimp Tempura)

        🍲 Miso Soup (Seaweed, Tofu, Mushrooms, Scallions)

        🍣 Crispy Rice (Spicy Tuna, Spicy Salmon)

        🍣 California Roll (Crab Mix, Cucumber, Avocado, Masago, Sesame)

        🍣 Shrimp Tempura Roll (Cucumber, Avocado,Daikon, Furikake)


        I knew I was going to love this place when I found out it was part of
        the same dining group as White Pie and Dos Santos.

        Pleasant experience and fast service even with a full house. The food
        was very delicious with portions being decent sized, I recommend trying
        their sushi in general, nice size pieces. They have a local selection of
        alcohol and the usual choices. The atmosphere is warm and the restaurant
        was kept clean during my stay. I will definitely come back and try out
        their outside patio sitting. And the staff was welcoming.

        As soon as I approached Sushi Row, I knew it was going to be not just a
        meal, but an experience. The atmosphere made me feel like I might see a
        celebrity in the corner. The tableware perfected their already
        thoughtfully curated vibe. Each sushi roll was unique and appetizing; it
        was hard to pick just a few to try. The Sweet Kaden Roll was my
        favorite. If you don’t love spice, this is a great option. The Kobra Kai
        Roll was also a hit. The paper thin slice of lemon topping the roll
        elevated the flavor from great to life changing. I also enjoyed the Row
        Cosmo. It was sweet with a little sourness from the cranberry which
        combined to be a deliciously refreshing beverage. It’s a must for sushi
        lovers and curious newcomers alike!
