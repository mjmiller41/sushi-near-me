        It's one of my favorite sushi spots in California so far. the owner is
        the sight and is the chef. Our server was extremely attentive and
        friendly, the restaurant was clean, and so were the restrooms. We had
        the crunchy dragon roll and spicy tuna roll, and both were great
        tasting, but the spicy tuna was the winner between them.

        I loved today's visit, and the friendly staff and owner they even have
        us a free ice cream and fried banana for my fiances birthday.

        Awful waitress, the girl acts like she doesn’t even want to be here. 
        Not welcoming at all!! Someone needs to get rid of here asap before all
        the bad reviews start coming in.  The food is severely overpriced.  They
        took away the all you can eat menu.  We only came here because we were
        starving.   Miso soup was cold and tasted terrible.  We will never come
        back here again.

        The service, pricing and portions here are all excellent. They offered
        us miso soup for free as part of our order and they have some great
        happy hour pricing (buy one, get one free beer). The sushi rice and
        presentation were also superb, and the only qualm I had was that I
        didn't love the fish (which, unfortunately is a big part of visiting a
        sushi restaurant).

        Honestly all their food is delicious and price is so reasonable. Their
        rolls are pretty big too. 8 rolls was about $13 for our order, total was
        $50 plus tip. We ordered tiger rolls, bakes scallop rolls and jumbo
        volcano rolls. For two people that was way more then enough. Order came
        with two miso soups. Everything was absolutely delicious. This time I
        ordered online, my order was ready for pickup within 20 mins.  The few
        experiences I had with dinr in is was geat. Service is great, atmosphere
        was fun. I highly recommend this place if you in town.
