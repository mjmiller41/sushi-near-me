        One of my go-to spots for sushi.  Doesn't smell of fish when you walk
        in, plenty of variety on their menu, and great prices. Usually, they
        give you a sliced orange with whipped cream, but they stopped that, and
        I'm sad. Overall, though, don't let the outside deter you from trying
        this place.

        My coworkers and I chose this location for our team luncheon. We placed
        the order for pickup up, and they made sure to complete all of our
        orders on time. I arrived to pick up the order and the employee who met
        me at the register was very kind and already had the orders ready to go.
        The atmosphere was very unique and traditional with Japanese-style art
        posters and lanterns adding to the ambience. Everyone was pleased with
        their order, especially the sushi. I look forward to visiting this
        location with my friends and family soon.

        I went here for the first time recently and I was excited to go but I
        think I ordered the wrong dishes. I didn't love anything I ordered. The
        fried calamari was oily and chewy, the sauce that came with it was way
        too sweet for me and the baked sushi dish I got was also really sweet.

        The service was good though. The place was clean and had a nice
        ambience. They have outside seating as well.

        I want to go back and try something different to see what its like
        because they have a huge menu.

        Food ★★★☆☆

        Service ★★★★★

        Atmosphere ★★★★☆


        Service was really good! Our waitress was attentive, kind, and checked
        on us often. The atmosphere was fun and modern. It was very clean, and a
        calmer place.


        Prices are really reasonable. Chirashi don was good, but there wasn't
        vinegar in the sushi rice; which was odd, but I still enjoyed it!


        The sweet shrimp nigiri was disappointing- it had a layer of soy sauce
        that made it hard to taste the shrimp underneath. When we requested the
        sweet shrimp without the soy sauce, the flavor was very savory, like the
        shrimp being used wasn't actual spot prawns that make the dish sweet
        shrimp. The otoro nigiri tasted more like chutoro (cheaper fatty tuna),
        and it also had a layer of soy sauce that made it difficult to taste the
        expensive fish being paid for 😟 The nigiri was disappointing.


        My friends ordered multiple sushi rolls, but couldn't taste the fish
        through the heavier seasoning. They still enjoyed their rolls though!


        Overall, I don't recommend their current specials, but their rolls
        aren't bad. The chirashi don is odd, but yummy! We probably won't order
        traditional sushi here, since their cuts aren't great, but modern rolls
        and hot food seems to taste good here!
