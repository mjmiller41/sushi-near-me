        Had a fantastic dinner here with generous portions of delicious food. I
        highly recommend ordering a meal that they cook on the grill as it is
        prepared right in front of you and is super fresh. The chef was highly
        entertaining and created such a fun and enjoyable experience for
        everyone. Will definitely be back in the future!

        Dirtiest restaurant I've been to in years. The bathroom looked like a
        gas station bathroom from the 1970's that hadn't been cleaned in forever
        and the rest of the restaurant wasn't much better. Food was bland,
        service so-so, and how we didn't get food poisoning is a miracle. I
        reported the bathroom to the staff and they looked at me like they
        didn't know what to do about it. The place is depressing!

        Disappointed After Years of Loyalty


        I’ve been a regular at Soho Sushi and Tappenanyaki for a long time. The
        food has always been great, the service solid, and I’ve recommended this
        place to friends and family countless times. In fact, any time we have a
        special occasion, I usually insist we go to Soho. But after my recent
        experience, I’m honestly questioning if I’ll ever come back.


        We went out as a family—me, my wife, our 4-year-old, our 3-year-old, and
        our 3-month-old infant. We spent about $184 in total, but nearly $30 of
        that was an automatic gratuity because of their “parties of 5 or more”
        policy.


        Here’s the issue: they counted our three-month-old baby as a full person
        toward that party of five. A baby who doesn't order food, doesn't drink
        water, doesn't even sit in their own chair. Just there, quiet in his car
        seat. I wouldn’t be complaining if we had five actual people eating. But
        charging us $30 extra because of an infant is just petty and greedy.


        This isn’t about tipping—I always tip well when service is good. This is
        about principle. If your policy can't distinguish between a paying guest
        and a literal newborn, it’s flawed. And honestly, it left a bad taste in
        our mouths after what should’ve been a nice family dinner.


        You just lost a loyal customer over $30 you didn’t earn.

        We ordered food and it was fine, service was less than mid at first but
        slightly got better, but that went downhill when we asked to share a
        plate and they made us pay $5. FIVE DOLLARS?? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
        Unbelievable manager policy, why make people pay an extra $5 when they
        already payed for the food? It's up to the customers what they do with
        the food no?? Food was good though, service was ok. **except for the
        guys that make the food in front of you, they're the star of the place
        and are very friendly and funny :D
