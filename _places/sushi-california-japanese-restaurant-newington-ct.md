        Been going here for 12-14 years and its the ONLY restaurant in CT that I
        can rely on to have an amazing meal every time. Was blown away by the
        quality we had tonight, best sushi I’ve had in a while and we eat sushi
        frequently. Definitely my favorite and go to place!

        For lunch we opted for the two special rolls lunch offer. For a starter
        we had the veggie dumplings, crispy and flavorful! The salad and
        mushroom soup were better than most! We had the ahi tuna roll, green
        hulk roll, New York roll and pink salmon roll. We loved the flavors and
        large portions. Definitely worth a visit for good sushi ! Will be coming
        back!

        I was traveling some cities on the east coast and got together with my
        relatives in Connecticut. My cousin who lives not too far from this
        neighborhood recommended this sushi place and made a reservation for our
        family get-together. After finishing our amazing sushi dinner, I
        realized why he loves this place so much. Everything was just so fresh
        and delicious. We ordered tamago sushi for the kids and the chef cut
        them in halves so that they can eat it easily. Everyone was so friendly
        and nice. Great food, great service. I so want to come here again next
        time I am in town. The whole family really enjoyed our dinner.

        By the way, they won many awards and they’ve been around over 10 years.

        What a great meal we shared with friends at Sushi California! Their
        attention to detail and presentation was really impressive on all of the
        sushi and sashimi. I thought the teppanyaki and Yaki soba dishes were
        fantastic as well! Everything was fresh, and the staff was friendly and
        welcoming. It was clean and the dining room had a nice ambience. I also
        thought it was nice that they had a menu of specials that get rotated
        out monthly! This is a great spot to know about in the area, and CCSU
        students should definitely come check this spot out!
