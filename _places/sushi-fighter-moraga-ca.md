        We arrived late(nearly 8), they close at 9. We ordered the cherry
        blossom, California roll,  salmon avocado roll, seaweed salad and the
        lion king(recommended). Drinks: Sake& Sauvignon blanc. We had a good
        time and the waitress checked in on us before the last call, which we
        ordered more. We didn’t leave until well after 9(we’ll never do that
        again; that was rude) but thank you for not acting annoyed or rushing us
        out.

        I read some reviews about added tip. We didn’t see that, but I gladly
        tipped for the service. All was good. Thanks! Added some similar
        pictures because I didn’t take pics but the pictures match what we
        ordered.

        Price for dinner: $90.24 before tip.

        California roll(8pcs)

        Avocado salmon roll(8pcs)

        Tobiko roll(2pcs)

        2 Lion king roll (8pcs each)

        Seaweed salad

        2 sake bottles

        2 glasses of white wine

        Miso Soup(on the house)

        Fairly quick service&professional server.

        This sushi restaurant is operated by Chinese instead of Japanese.


        I ordered katsudon and it was not authentic at all, very Chinese style
        with broccoli and carrot, and the pork meat was disappointedly dry. 
        Sushi was quite good and tasty.


        Decoration and atmosphere was not bad , BUT one of the chef keep talking
        to his friend fairly loud non-stop in Cantonese using a hand-free
        headset and phone while he was cooking and handling food right in front
        of him, spraying them with his saliva, got us worried about the hygiene
        standard here.  My friend dining with me understand the Cantonese
        language, she told me that this chef used lots of profanity in his phone
        conversation.  I found this very unprofessional, it had really ruined
        the whole atmosphere of our dining experience here.  We will never come
        back.


        Services from the waitress was very good though, I have to give her 5
        stars.

        This place is great. Ive been goin here for years. The rolls are great
        and the prices are reasonable. The service is standard, not much
        interaction beyond taking and delivering your order. They are not
        laboring to be fake friendly which is great for me because i just want
        good food without the fluff and "professional courtesy" that i often see
        being unpleasantly demanded by tourists  when they visit foreign
        countries.


        I love that they have sports on the tv when I've visited. I'm a solo
        eater and I love spots where i can preserve my solitude and eat good
        food. This place is one of them. Its not top of the line fish here
        otherwise this restaurant wouldn't even exist in that strip mall. Its
        the neighborhood sushi joint.

        does a great job with dishes like the salmon collar, beef short ribs,
        and sushi rolls, and George is consistently friendly and attentive,
        making it a great all-around experience.

        Posting this with regret, as we were long time customers and want our
        local businesses to succeed.  Over the past year, however, we have had
        several terrible experiences with Sushi Fighter, including missing items
        in orders, a flat refusal to serve us at 8:15 p.m., and problems with
        online orders.  We went in (in person, rather than posting a review) to
        ask them directly about these issues.  Manager and owner offered only
        excuses. There was absolutely no concern for our experiences, and no
        apology offered.
