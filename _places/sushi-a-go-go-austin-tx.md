        My husband and I approached the counter while four people were behind
        the counter all on their cell phones. Not one single person acknowledged
        our presence or offered to assist us. Luckily with self check out I was
        able to get my sushi paid for.  I continued to watch three other
        customers walk in. Two of which walked out and the third one had to ask
        if he could pay for his food. What kind of service is this?

        On top of it, I believe the manager stood back behind the counter,
        watching it all happened and did nothing.  As a customer service
        trainer, I would’ve written every single one of them up.

        I grabbed the California rolls before my flight, and got separate wasabi
        and ginger when I asked. It was fine - nothing spectacular, but I was
        happy enough with it.  The service was not great, but the reviews are
        really harsh on this place. You have to remember it’s an airport, so
        everything is overpriced everywhere. Bring your own food if you don’t
        want to deal with the airport prices and unpredictable quality.

        Food wasn’t great, can’t expect much when you’re buying premade rolls
        that have been in a refrigerated case all day.


        Staff stood at the register with my order while I stood at the counter
        beneath the huge sign that said “pick-up here” and looked confused when
        I expected them to bring it there.


        I wasn’t given wasabi or ginger with my food. I came back to the counter
        and the cashier gave me one small container of wasabi and one small
        container of ginger for three rolls. I asked for more and was given two
        more wasabi, and was denied a request for a fourth (I love wasabi). I
        attached a photo of the incredibly small amount of wasabi that I assume
        is supposed to be enough for an 8 piece roll.


        Don’t eat here, the sushi was mediocre and the staff is rude. There’s 10
        other options in the immediate vicinity.

        Terrible in every way.  The food was barely edible. They don't even have
        anyone working - you pay at a screen and it asks you to tip it!

  What Customers Are Saying About the Experience$$$Folks heading to
  Sushi-A-Go-Go often appreciate the convenience of grabbing quick sushi rolls
  right at the airport, even if the service sometimes feels a bit rushed during
  busy times. Many mention that the basic options like California rolls hit the
  spot for a simple meal on the fly, though some wish for a bit more attention
  to detail in portions and extras like wasabi. Overall, it's seen as a handy
  choice for travelers searching for sushi places near me, with a few noting
  that while the food is straightforward, it gets the job done in a pinch.
  Despite some mixed feelings on staff interactions, several reviews suggest
  it's worth trying if you're in the mood for affordable Japanese eats without
  high expectations. In the end, this spot earns points for being an easy,
  no-fuss option amid the hustle of airport dining.
