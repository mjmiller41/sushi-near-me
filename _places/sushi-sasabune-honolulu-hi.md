        I have been to sushi restaurants all over. Mostly, the restaurants i
        have been to, people rave about the food and I usually feel mediocre at
        best. HOWEVER, this was hands-down, the best sushi experience i have
        ever had! There is no menu for food (that is saw) and dish after amazing
        dish kept on arriving at the table. All so different and all so amazing
        with fantastic flavors melting around my palate. A couple of us had to
        tap-out near the end, but worth every single bite. With drinks and food,
        we were just over $200 per person and well-worth it! This unassuming
        restaurant is a hidden gem! If you are in Ohau,  you must make the time
        to experience this!

        Pretty good sushi, similar to another review the omakase menu isn’t
        clear. It’s not a set price but the chef chooses what sushi and dishes
        to serve and then you are charged individually for each. It’s a la carte
        omakase style. Wouldn’t go back or recommend the spot but nor would I
        stop someone from going. The decor is quite tired.

        Would I go there again? Probably not. It's pretty pricey. You can get to
        experience local fish and unique sushi. I didn't love every single dish,
        but there are a handful that I can appreciate and it was an interesting
        and unique experience since I normally eat the same type of more common
        sushi. I think there's a lack of transparency with the omakase style and
        pricing.  I think you can end your courses earlier if you wanted to save
        money or was full, but we didn't know that and just paid for every
        course and didn't end up eating the last few dishes thinking it was an
        all-in cost. The place is also a bit stuffy And not very inviting . The
        chef who looked like the head chef has a Stern stare and I felt judged
        by him and the staff . I echo what some of the other reviewers say about
        it. Feeling like the place thought highly of itself . I mostly wouldn't
        go back because it's expensive for what it is. It was minimum 200 per
        person.

        Fantastic high end sushi restaurant. Worth the price tag, but be
        prepared for it if you have never been. We paid $200 per person when we
        went. I've had high quality sushi and sushi with great flavors before,
        but this is the best I've ever had of both worlds. Extremely high
        quality fish and really well played out flavors in the offerings. Highly
        reccomend this place.

        Best sushi on the island, hands down. The freshest fish from all over
        the world (also hawaiian ahi, tako, opakapaka, sea urchin, among others)
        like Norwegian makeral, Tasmanian salmon, Hokkaido scallops, Japanese
        himachi, blue shrimp, oysters, lobster, and a bunch of others for a
        total of 14 courses. And the chef's menu is always changing, so you
        never know what you're going to get. The sauces and toppings are out of
        this world and make the nigiri even better. Service couldn't've been
        better, and a nice selection of sake and sochu also.

  Insights from Recent Feedback$$$Visitors often rave about the exceptional
  freshness and variety of the sushi, with many highlighting the creative twists
  on traditional flavors that make each bite memorable for sushi lovers
  exploring Hawaiian spots. While the omakase-style service keeps things
  exciting and unpredictable, some note that the pricing can add up quickly, so
  it's smart to go in with a budget in mind. Overall, the experience earns high
  marks for quality and service, though a few mention the atmosphere feels a bit
  formal, which might not suit everyone. If you're on the hunt for reliable
  sushi places near you, this one delivers a solid, enjoyable outing that's
  worth trying for its standout dishes and attentive vibe.
