        I had some friends in town and my friend wanted to try this place.  Nice
        casual, seafood restaurant vibe. They are known for their Sea Salt
        Assorted Sashimi Combo which has different sizes based on how many
        people you have.  Don't be sticker shock when looking at the prices as
        you do get a lot of food.  Just as we thought we were done, another set
        of dishes were brought to the table.  The quality of the sashimi was
        fresh and the other dishes were great as well.  We also ordered some
        galbi as well and we're completely full by the end.


        If you're looking to try something new with friends and family, I would
        recommend giving this place a shot.  I plan to visit this place again.

        Do NOT order the uni, it was very unfresh. The marinated raw crab was
        also a miss, with a strong fishy smell that was much worse than what
        I’ve had elsewhere. However, their lobster sashimi was great, super
        fresh and made from live lobster. After finishing the sashimi, they even
        fry the rest for you, which was a nice touch. That said, despite the
        lobster being good, everything else was disappointing.

        Every time I have a business trip to Vegas, this is a place I always
        visit! And without fail, I always end up heading home completely drunk!
        Haha.


        This time was no different—I had a great time eating, drinking, and went
        home tipsy. I’ve heard there are a few other restaurants with a similar
        vibe, but I always come here. Maybe it’s because I’m a regular, but the
        portions, quality, and service are all excellent.


        A glass of soju and sashimi—what more could you need!

        WOW. We ordered the seafood platter and Everything was so fresh and
        unbelievably good! We shocked how many side dishes and appetizers came
        with the platter. It just kept coming and coming. Unfortunately they
        didn’t have the octopus when we went but they still blew it out of the
        water. One of the best valve meals for want you are getting in Vegas!

        Found this place through Las Vegas Phil (super helpful for tourists).
        The food here was just amazing. We were craving raw marinated crabs and
        this place completely scratched the itch. Highly recommend their soy
        sauce marinated crab (came with raw shrimps), spicy marinated crab (less
        crab flavors though), and their live lobster ($65 for us).


        The lobster was still alive while we were eating. I got sad when they
        took it away after we finished the sashimi BUT turned out they took it
        to deep fry it for us to finish. Total after tips came out to be just
        under $100 per person. Overall, a very enjoyable meal for us.

  Customer Feedback Highlights$$$Visitors often rave about the fresh sashimi and
  generous portions that make meals feel worthwhile, especially when sharing
  with friends or family at this lively spot. While most agree the seafood
  platters and live lobster dishes deliver on flavor and variety, a few mentions
  of inconsistent freshness in certain items show it's not perfect every time,
  but the positives generally outweigh any minor hiccups. Overall, the
  atmosphere and service create a fun, casual environment that's great for
  trying new things, with many leaving satisfied and planning return trips. If
  you're hunting for sushi places near me that offer good value and a welcoming
  vibe, this restaurant tends to impress with its hearty offerings and
  thoughtful extras like fried accompaniments. In the end, it's a solid choice
  for anyone craving authentic seafood experiences in Las Vegas, as long as you
  go in with an open mind for the occasional variation.
