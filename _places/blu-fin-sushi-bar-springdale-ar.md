        First time visiting and we decided to sit at the bar.  Our server and
        chef were very engaging and friendly.


        My wife has celiac disease and our chef knew all the changes that were
        needed to keep it safe for her and they have Gluten free soy sauce.


        All of the items came out in a timely manner and were so beautiful. 
        Properly chilled, tender, and tasty


        She modified the Northern Lights Roll to be safe (no sauces) but still
        lit it up and cooked the roll on the inside


        We will come again

        This sushi restaurant is one of the best I’ve ever been to. The owner is
        always on location and runs one of the best restaurants that I frequent.
        Sushi is top shelf best quality and they really know what they are doing
        for quality and service. I make a stop here whenever I am staying in
        Springdale.

        2 months ago I ordered a bunch of food to go. When I went in to pick it
        up I had to wait over 20 minutes after the 30 minutes they told me it
        would take. When I got home, we had half of our order right. I will give
        them credit though, the manager called me and apologized and tried to
        make it right by saying she would take care of me when I came back in.
        Well, I tried again today. I called in, ordered 4 rolls to go. After
        waiting 5-7 mins up front, the manager came back and told me they
        finally figure it out. Turns out they haven’t even started my meal. She
        blamed it on a new waitress. I told her I was done with them and walked
        out. I will never try blu fin again, which is a shame, because the food
        there is really good. They obviously have staff and communication issues
        that need to get figured out. Service needs to be a priority.

        Had the Highlander roll and it was amazing! The only problem was the
        service. The waitress took my order, served the food but never seen her
        again! She never came back to check on me and I needed extra napkins.
        Finally, another waitress cleared my plates and I had to ask for my
        check. It's ashame because the food is a 5 star but customer service
        needs improvement!
