        My family and I were out of town, and my daughter decided she wanted to
        try Sushi for the first time.


        We decided on this place because they had a Chicken Teriyaki Sushi roll,
        which we figured might be the easiest for her to start with. But we all
        ordered several different types of Sushi so she could try different
        types.


        All the sushi was AMAZING! It was all freshly prepared and came out
        super quick. The staff was friendly and welcoming, and full of smiles :)


        Thank you guys for making my daughter's first sushi experience so
        awesome! She loved the Tempura California roll and is now a big time
        fan!


        We'll definitely be back when we are in your area again.

        My family and I were out of town, and my daughter decided she wanted to
        try Sushi for the first time.


        We decided on this place because they had a Chicken Teriyaki Sushi roll,
        which we figured might be the easiest for her to start with. But we all
        ordered several different types of Sushi so she could try different
        types.


        All the sushi was AMAZING! It was all freshly prepared and came out
        super quick. The staff was friendly and welcoming, and full of smiles :)


        Thank you guys for making my daughter's first sushi experience so
        awesome! She loved the Tempura California roll and is now a big time
        fan!


        We'll definitely be back when we are in your area again.

        If you’re looking for “sushi” nearby just try them out. Good value and
        decent food; good service with limited seating but a lot better than the
        chain Chinese place across the street.

        Nope. Got spring roll special $6, it was only 2 small rolls cut into
        halves. How cheap and chintzy. They were ok. Sumo roll and veggie roll
        was basic and lackluster. Got the glass noodle with vegetables special
        and it was all onions and gloppy noodles uhg. $6.99. Took one bite and
        sent it back and they argued with me to take it off the bill. Basically
        told me too bad I ordered it. I told them it was unacceptable and they
        didn’t offer me anything to replace it. Finally they conceded and told
        me next time they won’t do that. Your right. Won’t be back.

        I recently ordered dinner from Sushi and Rolls in Livonia, and it was
        quite an experience! First up was the Tempura California Roll. It scored
        an 8/10 for me, perfectly crispy and flavorful. Then came the Cancun
        Roll, topped with mangoes that added a delightful balance of sweetness -
        a solid 9/10. The Dynamite Roll was another highlight; deep-fried to
        perfection, it was an absolute delight and also earned a 9/10.


        My husband tried the Bibim-Bob with Beef and loved it, giving it a 9/10.
        We also tried the Wednesday Special, which included the Las Vegas &
        American Dream rolls. Unfortunately, these were a bit of a letdown due
        to the excessive cream cheese, which overpowered the other flavors,
        leading to a score of 4/10. However, I believe that with less cream
        cheese, they could potentially reach a 7.


        The Miso Soup was good, earning an 8/10 - a comforting and tasty choice.
        The Octopus Nigiri was also enjoyable, deserving an 8/10. However, the
        Glass Noodles didn't quite hit the mark for me, scoring only a 3/10 as I
        didn't quite like them.


        Overall, I loved most of the dishes here at Sushi and Rolls. The quality
        and flavors were impressive, and I'm definitely planning to order again
        to try more of their offerings.

        We always have a good meal at this small eatery.  This is my daughter’s
        favorite place to eat.  They always make her plate cute and decorative
        and it makes her feel so special.  The food is very tasty I love the
        specials they have on the chalkboard.  Service is fast and friendly. 
        For lunch I love the Bento box and for dinner the ramen noodles (I have
        chicken added) or Firecracker/Lion king or heart attack roll is great.
