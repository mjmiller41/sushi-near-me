        RUDE RUDE RUDE! I placed this order on Uber eats and specifically wrote
        notes to the restaurant stating that I do not want tobiko (THE
        RESTAURANT PUT EXTRA 😒) I also said no eel (they still threw it on
        there anyways) I just don't understand why I'm getting an attitude from
        the lady that answered the phone when I mentioned my concerns to her.
        Yelling at a customer because you can't understand what the word “NO”
        means is not appropriate. Thanks for ruining my freaking dinner. They
        told me to drive there and they'll give me new ones but why would I do
        that when I had this delivered and paid all these fees? DO BETTER!

        The food came to us hot and fast. That is about the best I can say. The
        fried rice was literally white rice with soy sauce and was the most
        flavorful things we had. The one packet of sit sauce they included
        didn't make up for the blandness of everything we ordered.  Since we are
        in a hotel room and never saw the inside of the place, I cannot speak
        for atmosphere, but had to choose a rating.

        Just did apps. Lobster Rangoon was not overly sweet, had great flavor,
        nice and crunchy even after Door Dash delivery. Scallion Pancakes were
        tasty, chewy with a nice crisp. Spring rolls were tasty and super
        crispy. Good prices even with the 3rd party delivery charges.

        Got into DT Boston late and was looking for something quick and
        reasonably priced.  This location was two blocks from my hotel.  They
        offer a great menu with a variety of foods.  The menu was reasonably
        priced.  Easy to order for takeout (or dine-in).  The service was
        quick.  Portions were consistent with pricing.  I enjoyed a really nice
        dinner that was fresh and hot!

        My friend and I were searching for a post-midnight bite when we stumbled
        upon this place in South Boston. The food here is typical cheap Chinese
        takeout food that you can get anywhere in the U.S., so when we first saw
        their menu, we expected to get something like Panda Express bowls.


        But as they say, looks can be deceiving. We got the salmon bowl and the
        sesame chicken, and both were far better than we anticipated. The
        chicken was succulent and moist within, and the salmon, too, was a cut
        above what one would expect from a fast-food joint. Though priced
        slightly higher than your typical chain, the quality and taste justified
        the extra cost.


        Although there are some late-night options available in Chinatown,
        Teriyaki House still manages to stand out, providing a satisfactory
        quick bite that doesn't skimp on quality. If you're in the area and
        looking for a solid meal without the wait, this might just be your spot.

  What Customers Are Saying About the Food$$$Folks often rave about the tasty
  appetizers like crab rangoon and scallion pancakes, which come out crispy and
  full of flavor, making them a hit for casual takeout orders. Many appreciate
  the reasonable prices and quick service, especially when grabbing
  Japanese-inspired dishes that feel fresh and satisfying for a light meal on
  the go. While some experiences highlight minor issues like occasional order
  mix-ups, the overall vibe leans positive with praise for the variety of
  options that keep things affordable and accessible. It's a solid pick for
  anyone hunting for sushi places nearby, as the portions generally deliver good
  value without skimping on taste. All in all, if you're in the mood for
  straightforward Asian fare, this spot offers enjoyable moments with a few
  areas that could use a bit more polish for an even better experience.
