        I want to start off with that sushi isn't my favorite go to.  But I did
        have someone with who loves sushi and eats it quite frequently.


        The first thing I want to speak to is on the menus, the prices were
        crossed off and hand written ones were in place. The hand writing was
        difficult, at best, to make out. Personally, not a fan of that.


        I did defer to the person that was with, who loves sushi for their
        input. Their opinion was the sushi was fresh. The texture was perfect,
        and the flavor was spot on. However, they said the Wasabi wasn't very
        spicy or flavorful.


        I tried the General Tso's chicken with white rice. I thought the rice
        was superb! I really enjoyed it. The chicken was good, but very chewy.


        They had a large selection of Boba tea. Again, not my thing, but
        something I feel I should point out.


        I felt that overall, it was a bit pricey. Staff was friendly. But,
        again, you don't really know the prices as they write them onto the
        menus.


        I hope this helps. Cheers!

        I want to start off with that sushi isn't my favorite go to.  But I did
        have someone with who loves sushi and eats it quite frequently.


        The first thing I want to speak to is on the menus, the prices were
        crossed off and hand written ones were in place. The hand writing was
        difficult, at best, to make out. Personally, not a fan of that.


        I did defer to the person that was with, who loves sushi for their
        input. Their opinion was the sushi was fresh. The texture was perfect,
        and the flavor was spot on. However, they said the Wasabi wasn't very
        spicy or flavorful.


        I tried the General Tso's chicken with white rice. I thought the rice
        was superb! I really enjoyed it. The chicken was good, but very chewy.


        They had a large selection of Boba tea. Again, not my thing, but
        something I feel I should point out.


        I felt that overall, it was a bit pricey. Staff was friendly. But,
        again, you don't really know the prices as they write them onto the
        menus.


        I hope this helps. Cheers!

        Hair?:

        I often go to Sushi Cafe to get a boba and an occasional poke bowl and I
        honestly love going here! But… the 2 out of the 2 times i’ve gotten a
        poke bowl, I’ve found HAIR in my salmon. I still do love this place,
        enjoy the environment and how amazingly kind the workers are, I would
        just love to see some hair nets or some more precautions for sanitary
        reasons.

        What happened to this place. 5 years ago this place was good. The food
        was on point, the staff didn’t do pull-ups in the doorway… To call it
        disgusting doesn’t do it justice. The rice was the only thing I could
        take more than a few bites of and even that was questionable.


        As far as the “tuna” in my spicy “tuna” roll goes. I’m pretty sure
        that’s not tuna. If anything it’s just bread crumbs mixed with spicy
        mayo. I’m also pretty sure the chicken was precooked along with the
        rice. How do you explain rice that is hot and cool in the same bite ?
        And the miso soup, it’s more like dish water, how can your miso soup be
        so cloudy. A good miso is the same as Pho, if it’s cloudy you need more
        work…


        As far as reading the reviews and responses from the owner. This owner
        probably doesn’t know how to run a restaurant much less staff it. The
        food is below average for the prices you are charging. I ran restaurant
        for 12 years and this one makes me sad because it was once good…
        whatever happened definitely reflects through to your guests…


        and you don’t need that many to-go boxes…

        What a surprise!! This place is amazing. I didnt think a tiny sushi
        place out  in the suburbs can serve up such delicious food. Boy, was I
        wrong. We came once before but was turned away because of the price. But
        after reading constant positive reviews from a local FB page, I had to
        try. I ordered the salmon poke bowl with greens. It came with miso soup
        and side salad. The ginger dressing for the salad was awesome; it was
        the perfect balance of sweet, sour, and subtle spice. The poke bowl was
        the best part, generous portions of meat. I was afraid the bowl was
        going to be 80% greens, which is how other places do it because they're
        stingy cheap. The fish tasted great and the toppings were great. I would
        love to go back. The CA roll was good too.

        The restaurant is clean and nice. We got the pecan shrimp, crunch roll,
        shrimp tempura roll, and chicken Pad Thai. The food portions were big,
        food tastes great, and the pricing is reasonable.
