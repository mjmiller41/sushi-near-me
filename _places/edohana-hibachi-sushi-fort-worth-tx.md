        sauce! The meat was really good! The shrimp and zucchini were good too!
        The sake was stout but good! Service was outstanding! It is reasonable
        priced.

        THEY AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDE A 18% SERVICE CHARGE AND REQUEST AT TIP ON
        TOP OF THAT!


        (They brought out multiple receipts for each person in our group making
        it very kerfuffled and sus. Some in our group ended up accidentally
        tipping 40%)


        It was very loud and more group orientated, we went for a birthday and
        it was fun but getting service including drinks took a while because of
        the amount of people and flagging down a waiter was hectic on the
        Thursday dinner we went. We did have reservations in advance too. We had
        to yell just to speak to the person next to us. The floors were sticky
        and they played Fox News the entire time. The hibachi chef we got wasn't
        the most energetic but it was still fun and the skill absolutely was
        there.


        The hibachi dinners include a light soup broth that was very flavorful
        and a basic salad with a vinaigrette type of dressing. The main dinner
        food included half a dinner plate of rice, a quarter lo mein and a
        quarter vegetables and half the plate of chicken with two side sauce
        options. For the $21 per plate I feel like we got a good amount of food
        especially for it being made so fresh.

        Great restaurant, the food and energy did not disappoint. Our table was
        great, the service was great and the food was plentiful and yummy. I
        highly recommend this location for dinner or any occasion. Even the
        kids' portion was large, which we took home. They even made side noodles
        for us to take home as requested. The price is the same as you would
        find at these types of restaurants, which is good when it all goes as
        well as our experience.

        I ended up really liking this place! They have a large menu, but I only
        got to try the sushi this time. I went a little out there and ordered
        some rolls along with some sashimi. I was expecting a few slices of fish
        on a plate, but they really go all out on their sashimi!! The salmon was
        a little large, but it was so tender, it melted in our mouths. There was
        a sauce on the spicy tuna that I couldn't place, but it was absolutely
        delicious. The service is quick and friendly. I'll definitely come back
        and try the hibachi side.
