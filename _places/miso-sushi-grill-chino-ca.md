        This is a pretty good sushi place! The food is pretty decent and the
        service is good! The fish is fresh; no complaints there! The taste of
        the food is pretty basic and the jalapeño poppers were just okay (they
        are also not jalapeño poppers?), but nothing about the food or service
        disappointed!

        Stopped by here on our way home and decided to order teriyaki chicken
        entrees, They were delicious and had great portions. The miso soup is
        yummy and the chicken was tender. We waited to eat it so next time I
        would order teriyaki on the side but other than that it was perfect and
        the service was good too. The lady that took our order was super nice
        and friendly. The order came out promptly and glad I came in before 9
        because they close at 930 and I know sometimes restaurants don't take
        any more orders after a certain time. So thank you for still taking us.

        ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐


        6-Star Sushi Restaurant!!! 🍣✨


        I could not rate this place more highly. I happened to park nearby while
        famished for some lunch, so I decided to stroll on in. I was pleasantly
        greeted by Kai, and his customer service was truly out of this world!


        Kai and the cook Ken catered to my needs perfectly, taking great care to
        ensure my celiac dietary needs were met! Not a single trace of gluten
        came near my sushi roll. I've never had such a seamless experience at a
        sushi joint. Eating out isn't always this easy with my condition, but
        this restaurant feels just like home.


        The food was phenomenal. I LOVE me some good salmon, so I ordered the
        Salmon Lover specialty roll. The salmon was so velvety, it literally
        felt like melted in my mouth while eating it. I scarfed that bad boy
        down so fast, I immediately ordered a new roll after that.


        Once again, I cannot commend the service enough. I hope anyone who reads
        this feels inspired to give the place a try if they have certain dietary
        restrictions that they believe may be possible to work around with the
        proper food preparation because you'll absolutely find that here. The
        price is absolutely worth the service.


        The atmosphere in here was very calming and relaxing. The music isn't
        too loud. Good vibes all-around, and the radio is relaxing at a good
        volume nearby the bar section where you can sit alone if you're just
        coming for a quick bite. Plenty of seats and tables available if you are
        coming with a group of friends or family.


        Menu was easy to read, and there's a lot of great options. If you're in
        the area, let's give this place the love it deserves! I'm definitely
        coming here more. It's nearby one of my commutes. 🙂


        (P.S. The roll in my picture was my second roll. I tried the Mango Tango
        roll with seaweed replacing soy paper, yellowtail instead of salmon, and
        no tempura. I finished the Salmon Roll before taking a picture. 😂)

        Food is good and fresh. At least the Bento I had but was annoyed by menu
        on yelp. Price says $9.95 but has been raised to $16.95. So they got me
        in by false advertising. When I told them about it they did not say they
        would correct. So food good but deceptive practice in place with menu.
