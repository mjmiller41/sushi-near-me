        I have never been to Jing, but they recently popped up on my DoorDash.
        They have some of the most delicious sashimi I have had from local
        restaurants. I wish there was a bit more eel in the unagi don, but it is
        also delicious. The miso soup is very tasty as well. I will be ordering
        from here frequently.

        (Delivery from GrubHub) We ordered Miso soup, kani salad, the Valentine
        roll, the special tuna roll, and sashimi white tuna and yellowtail. The
        portions were very small considering how expensive our meal was. It was
        pretty bland too. Especially the kani salad. I mean, it's cucumber and
        imitation crab meat, you HAVE to add some flavor to it...but they
        didn't. Even the wasabi was dried out and bland! We had to add our own
        horseradish to it. The sashimi sizes are very small. $3.50 for a tiny
        slice. And they put the hot soup in the same bag - directly on top of! -
        the raw fish!! The kani salad was warm. 🤢 The entire meal was
        incredibly boring and overpriced. If you're close to Hiro Sushi or
        Akida, order from them instead!

        My wife and I are frequent customers of Jing, and our experience has
        always been pleasant. Their vegetarian sushi (especially the sweet
        potato roll) is a favorite.  Their customer service is always on point,
        the food is ready in a reasonable amount of time, and items that aren't
        sushi are just as tasty and well executed.  Strong recommend - it's
        delightful to have a neighborhood sushi spot!
