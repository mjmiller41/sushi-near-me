        Easy 5 stars. The food is outstanding and authentic. We had a few dishes
        (iwashi (sardine sushi), a roasted eggplant with miso and walnuts) you
        don’t often see on standard fare sushi restaurant menus. Salmon nigiri,
        unagi, ikura were also incredible. Very neat and cozy ambiance. About
        $175 for 2 of us, who ate a lot of food and shared 2 bottles of sake.

        Small restaurant but surprisingly empty on a weekend at 630. We were
        seated right away and after ordering our food came quickly. The tofu was
        homemade but small for its price and not as silky as I was hoping for. I
        found the sushi rice to be on the harder side and the ratio of rice to
        fish to be a bit high.

        Food was good and the sashimi was fresh. We really enjoyed the homemade
        tofu and dishes that we ordered. But like other reviews, the server was
        really rude and service was weird.


        When we sat at the table, the restaurant was really warm so we wanted to
        have the beer first but the server refused to take the order and told us
        that we need to order drinks with food and left without taking orders.


        We got another server after her and she was okay but it was not a
        pleasant experience.

        Feels like stepping into my grandmother’s kitchen - the warmth and
        deliciousness of the food is unparalleled. The house made tofu is
        delicious and the strawberry mochi was perfect!

        If I could rate this place higher I would. Best Japanese food I’ve ever
        had seriously. If you are in the area it is more than worth the stop.
        Reasonably priced and so so tasty. Best tofu I have ever had. Raw fish
        is beyond fresh you’d expect it to still be breathing. Quality of not
        only food but the environment is CLEAN and zen… very very good vibes in
        here for date nights, birthday night, celebrations or even dining alone.
        I hope to be back soon as I’m from Pittsburgh pa but I dream of this
        restaurant every week 😌✨

        Even the desert was so so epic. Amazing staff they were all so kind and
        patient and answers every one of my questions. The green tea is also so
        so good and earthy and woody. So authentic and lovely.
