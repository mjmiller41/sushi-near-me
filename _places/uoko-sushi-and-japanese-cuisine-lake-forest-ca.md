        Our fav sushi spot in South OC. It's a local / regulars spot and
        excellent if you sit at the sushi bar. But sushi bar is competitive and
        it's hard to get a seat unless you arrive before opening, most days,
        both lunch and dinner. We usually let the chef decide what we'll eat and
        it's seriously good sushi. Very reasonably priced for the quality.

        Hereâ€™s a refined version of your review with improved flow and clarity,
        while keeping your original voice:


        We went for lunch on a weekday and tried their lunch special, where you
        can pick five items from a list for about $22. We sat at the bar, which
        was a nice spot to watch the sushi being prepared.


        The yellowtail sushi was amazing â€” definitely a highlight. The tuna
        sushi and tuna cut roll were also really good. Eel sushi was great too.


        We didnâ€™t love the albacore or salmon sushi, but that might have been
        because of the sauce they used; next time, I'll probably ask for it
        without the sauce. We also werenâ€™t fans of the spicy yellowtail hand
        roll, but the regular yellowtail hand roll was good, so it seems it was
        the sauce in the spicy version that didnâ€™t quite work for us.


        overall great customer service, great atmosphere, great fish quality,
        and a great selection. I would highly recommend.

        Came for lunch on a weekday, and service was fast. They have a sushi bar
        area, regular seating, and booth seating near the entrance. We opted for
        two lunch combos to try, and both were good. Loved that their raw fish
        and sushi were pretty fresh, and the owner was super friendly and nice.
        The only suggestion would be the portions, the pork chop sashimi combo
        was so tiny (like a kidâ€™s meal)


        Overall, love the freshness. Relatively reasonable prices compared to LA
        sushi places, but we do wish the portions were bigger. Worth a visit!

        It is an unpretentious place with an immaculate execution. A perfect
        place for lunch or dinner. The rice and sushi is awesome. Better than in
        Japan. A warm towel starts you off with a salad and drink. Everything
        after that is wonderful, light, and super clean tastes. Best I've had.
        They show you the whole fish to show you how fresh it is. Absolute
        perfection. A must.

        A wonderful little sushi dive in the area of the hotels. This is my
        third trip in and the food has been very fresh and extremely
        consistent.  There is no fancy styling on my plate, just fresh sushi
        roles.

        made quick and good. always busy when I above been at this place. We
        went with two rolls, one rainbow, and one spicy salmon. very good and
        nice size. Very simple decor and very busy sushi chefs.  I loved the
        women serving us as I ordered, She only let us order what she thought we
        would eat.
