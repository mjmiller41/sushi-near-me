        Impeccable service meets culinary excellence here. The sardine sushi
        shines and fresh, expertly balanced, and unforgettable. Upscale, pricey,
        but worth it for refined Japanese dining. Perfect for special nights.

        I had the chance to visit here with my wife after longing to go for
        years. The high ceilings and spacious interior immediately made the
        experience feel both relaxing and refined. Not only is there an omakase
        bar, but there are also table seating options, giving diners flexibility
        and comfort.


        As someone who loves aged sushi, I was delighted that most of the pieces
        were prepared in that style. The fish in each bite felt incredibly
        tender, and the flavors were deepened by the aging process. Their house
        soy sauce stood out for its perfect balance of savory notes without
        being overly salty, allowing the natural taste of the fish to shine. The
        sushi rice was some of the best I’ve ever had—firm enough to hold
        together, yet soft and flavorful when you bite into it.


        From the glossy tuna cuts to the delicate white fish slices, every piece
        looked pristine on the wooden plate. One highlight was the crab, which
        was gently shredded and topped with a subtle yet rich accent. The
        attention to detail in the presentation and the freshness of each
        ingredient made the entire course feel special.


        I’m still a huge fan of Shiro Sushi and visit regularly, but I’ve been
        missing the distinctive taste I first experienced during my earliest
        visits. However, at Takai by Kashiba, I rediscovered the very flavors I
        had been searching for, which made the meal especially memorable. To top
        it off, my wife and I were fortunate enough to meet Chef Shiro Kashiba
        himself that evening. As fans who have frequented restaurants run by his
        disciples, it was an honor to talk with him. Hearing him emphasize
        “customer first” gave me a clear understanding of why his establishments
        consistently deliver such a warm and exceptional dining experience.


        Overall, Takai by Kashiba lived up to and surpassed all expectations. If
        you’re looking for a memorable omakase experience with impeccable aged
        sushi, wonderful service, and a welcoming atmosphere, this is a
        must-visit destination.

        Great omakase at the chef counter, which sits 8 people. You start with
        some appetizers, then sashimi, and the chef prepares nigiri 8 pieces of
        the same type for 8 guests at a time, so you all eat at the same pace.
        There are about 10 pieces of nigiri each, with very little sushi rice so
        it’s not very filling. They serve steamed egg, seasonal tempura in
        between, the a hand roll, miso soup and finally desert.

        All and all, it was a great experience.

        A very well curated fresh/aged fish with other smaller dishes(tempera,
        chawanmushi, miso soup, etc.) in between. Highly recommend getting the
        uni on the side and don’t forget to eat the shiso, a very fragrant and
        refreshing mint (green leaf)! The rice in sushi was a perfect amount and
        I like how simple each dish was. There are no overpowering sauces. You
        must enjoy fish to come here.

        This review is for a couple visits last year for omakase. The fish
        selection was pretty good, and  there were other dishes like chawan
        mushi, shishito tempura and the dessert was tamago cake and ice cream
        Ambiance and service were excellent too. They also returned our coats
        warm. Definitely a more upscale place and better that the Kashiba in
        Seattle by Pike place.
