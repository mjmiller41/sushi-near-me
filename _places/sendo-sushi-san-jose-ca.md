        Visited them quite a few times. All raw fish dishes are highest quality.
        Fish pieces are of generous size. Staff is very friendly and quick.
        Can't believe we have this gem at our little lunch plaza.

        Delicious sushi and nice atmosphere.

        Highly recommend the food here. I had the specialty rolls and they’re
        always fresh and flavorful. The rolls are a good large portion! I like
        that if you sit down they give you complementary edamame. The miso soup
        was full of flavor and the mochi ice cream was soft and sweet, so
        delicious!

        Also, every time I’ve been to the restaurant the staff have always been
        kind and made me feel welcomed.

        I like the decor, my part favorite being a wall of cinematic posters.
        Good for starting a conversation of you’re with someone.

        UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT


        It's a shame the previous owners tarnished the Sendo Sushi name because
        my experience was nothing like I had previously read online. The sashimi
        tasted fresh and had the right consistency. Teriyaki chicken was
        flavorful but not overly artificial and sugary. And the salmon was
        cooked to perfection with a wonderful flavor profile. The Dynamite and
        Crunchy Salmon rolls were of similar vein while also offering all the
        trendy accouchements that most modern sushi spots have nowadays. I would
        have to say, Sendo Sushi punches above it's weight class and the pricing
        was extremely competitive for the quality of food you're getting. I can
        comfortably say Sendo is one of the better eateries in the North San
        Jose

        Dinner bento box is a great option if you want to try multiple items!
        Had the tuna roll, salmon teriyaki, and sashimi- all were very good and
        the fish was very fresh! Portions are large and the food is all
        delicious. Service was wonderful and attentive. Will definitely be back!

        I had a dinner bento with 3 items to go and thought the price was a bit
        high, but it came with a huge portion and everything tasted great, so it
        totally justified the price. Would come back for the teriyaki chicken.
        :)
