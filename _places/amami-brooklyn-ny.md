        Great spot for sushi! The patio space was great, and the whole visual
        vibe of the restaurant was open, trendy, and accessible. Service was
        quick and friendly. We split the pork gyoza, charred edamame, and purple
        potato fries with matcha mayo and they were all AMAZING!


        The spicy girl roll was my favourite. All the sushi was fresh and
        colourful, and tasted so good. Definitely recommend, and will keep on a
        list for future NYC visits.

        Wow, this place is beautiful! Great interior design and artwork. But
        wait, the sushi and sashimi was delicious too. And the service was
        great. Friendly and prompt. Right by McCarren Park too? Great location.
        Definitely looking forward to falling into this place again soon.

        I have been coming back here couple times after first visited. Mostly
        come with my friend and she is okay with this place. Today she is in a
        mood for sushi so this restaurant is around my neighborhood.


        We have Sashimi Ozara, Kama island, Toro Dynasty, Pork gyoza, Purple
        Fries, Yaki shishito pepper and 2 bottle toro tempranillo torque.


        Food is good but at the beginning my friend complain about the waitress
        that she is not focus and looks like she is out of energy, she forgets
        lots of stuff like our share plates, napkins, glasses. But there is
        another waiter that came to our table and get the order or something we
        want.


        overall, I still like this restaurant. The location is right near
        McCarren park and they have dog friendly seat outside, after you walk
        your pup and you are hungry you can stop by this place.

        Loved this Japanese Restaurant. It is a beautiful space.  The murals are
        beautiful.  It is beautifully set up.  The playlist they had on was very
        good. The service is wonderful.  The food comes out quickly but at a
        good pace.  You don't feel rushed.  The food was 😋.  I had the lunch
        special ($16) which includes choice of Soup or Salad, one roll (large
        selection) and an Entrée (choice of Salmon, Chicken, Tofu and Steak)
        they come with White Rice and Vegetables.  I had the Miso Soup, White
        Tuna and Jalapeño Roll and Steak.  The Vegetables that came with my
        Steak were Onions and Peppers.  I don't know if it's the same Vegetables
        on all the Entrées.  I would think it is.  Everything was made to
        perfection and beautifully presented.  They also have other lunch
        specials and an A La Carte Menu.  We only had water but they do have a
        full bar.  Dessert was not included but we ordered it anyway.  I had the
        Mochi Green Tea.  The Ice Cream itself was Green Tea and it tasted great
        but I don't think I would order Mochi Green Tea again.  My friend
        ordered Tempura Cheesecake.  I tried a little piece.  It was
        interesting.  The Cheesecake was very creamy and sweeter than New York
        Cheesecake.  This place is good for dining with others and also for Solo
        dining.  I have to come back to try some things from their A La Carte
        Menu and to try one or two of their Cocktails.
