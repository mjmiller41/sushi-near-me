        First time at this restaurant and will definitely be back! Amazing to
        finally have a good sushi restaurant downriver. It is clear that all the
        seafood is fresh. And our waitress even said they bring it in fresh
        daily.

        Update: we went back for the second week in a row! Tried something
        different and was equally impressed with the freshness of the seafood!
        Also, because it was Valentine’s Day, we got a free tuna sushi in the
        shape of a heart!

        So we moved here from Florida! We have yet to find good sushi! Well, we
        have finally found it!! Eve’s is clean, fresh, delicious and amazing.
        The sushi chef is extremely knowledgeable and talented. We explained to
        him a cooked roll we favor from Florida! He replicated it perfectly!

        Then the hibachi……it’s NOT overly salty! It’s perfect! Their rice is
        seasoned not SALTED or overly Teriyaki and Soy soaked! Then they give
        you noodles with every meal! WOW!!! Again, seasoned NOT soaked in sauce!

        The salad dressing…. I don’t know what the ingredients are BUT I have
        never in my life loved a dressing more! I asked if they sold it! They
        said everyone asks that! They said Eve makes the dressing homemade, from
        scratch, daily and with all fresh ingredients! She said it takes like 18
        ingredients and a long process to make! I told her I want to buy a
        bottle and have it at home because my Son uses it to dip his chicken in
        it! It’s delicious, to say the least! We have eaten here 4-5 times now
        and it hasn’t quality, taste, service, cleanliness at all!

        I had a great time at Eve Sushi! The atmosphere was cozy and the place
        was spotless. Our server, Tina, was excellent—super friendly and
        outgoing and same with the manager. The food was delicious, and the
        mochi for dessert was the perfect way to end the meal. Definitely coming
        back!

        This place is so cute, it’s clean, the owner was walking around. The
        food was fantastic. Hibatchi was amazing and so was the sushi.
        Definitely worth every penny, it’s freshly made, you can see the
        vegetables are bright and colorful. Highly recommend, I use to only go
        to one specific place in canton, so glad there’s a place closer!

        I'm a fan of Hibachi's so I had to try the one nearby, but this one
        didn't quite hit the spot. I'd like to give props to the ambience, they
        did put some effort into that. They did make the food a little
        presentable and that's cute and all but taste matters. Sushi and Miso
        soup were commendable. Calamari and Steak hibachi had a fallout.
        Calamari was mostly breading and it was a tad too pricey for the amount
        received. Lunch and dinner hibachi not only varies in size but also in
        price, I say that because other Hibachi's would usually have the same
        portion sizes but will only vary with prices based on time
        (lunch/dinner). Also, the steak temperature wasn't as requested - I know
        we could've asked for it corrected but it was still a little far from
        what was ordered. The hibachi rice also didn't match my expectation.
