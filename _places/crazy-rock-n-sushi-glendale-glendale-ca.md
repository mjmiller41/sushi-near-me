        This is the sushi place. THE sushi place!! I've been here twice now and
        let me tell you, im not disappointed. My first time here i had baked
        salmon sushi and some fried rice. The baked salmon was so delicious that
        it left me craving for more! I recently went here again and I can
        confidently say that I wasn't disappointed again! Of course I got the
        baked salmon sushi but I also got a different sushi. I forget the name
        but it was so good! It had shrimp sticking out and was topped with green
        onion, spicy mayo and eel sauce! The popcorn shrimp was super good too
        and even better with the spicy mayo!


        The environment is really nice as well! It feels really comfy and so
        chill. The workers here are very nice too! This whole place is my happy
        place!


        For price, I think its justified. The sushi really do fill you up. I was
        stuffed both times.


        Would I recommend this place? Heck yeah! This place ROCK'N rolls!! I
        would come back here again and try out the rest of the menu! So yummers!

        *UPDATE 4/27/25* MINUS 3 STARS for rotten shrimp & condescending, rude
        Hostess/Manager. PLUS 2 STARS stars for the excellent waitresses,
        waiters & to the chefs for the majority of our meal.


        Tonight, my husband & I were having a great dinner! The food was
        wonderful, the service was excellent, & the vibes were chill UNTIL our
        last dish came...


        I love Amaebi & have eaten it (in the States & in Japan) more times than
        I can count, so I was excited for the dish to arrive! IT. WAS. AWEFUL.
        It tasted rotten/sour. I spit it out! It made me feel kind of sick just
        from the taste! A lovely waitress must have seen this because she came
        right over to take it away very politely. I thanked her.


        It was hard to get the bad taste out of my mouth. That shrimp was
        definitely bad, but it happens, I thought. Oh well! Husband & I
        continued chatting.


        THEN, the Hostess/Manager came over to talk to us... SHE WAS VERY RUDE.
        She said that the chefs tried the shrimp & it was fine, then she
        condescendingly EXPLAINED to me what Amaebi was supposed to taste
        like... Seriously?! Next she said that said she "respected" that I
        didn't like it but that that WAS how it was supposed to taste... Even
        though she didn't taste the piece I spit out. I explained that I've
        eaten it many times here & in Japan, I know how it should taste. She
        rudely said, "well, it's MY culture"... Seriously!? Rotten food tastes
        the same in every country, so what's the point of saying that?It's
        preposterous, condescending & weird! Horribly unprofessional.


        She kept pushing saying that the shrimp tasted fine until I said, "But
        there were two shrimp. The shrimp YOU had may have been fine but the one
        I spit out certainly wasn't." She was like, Oooh. Yeah, that could be
        it.


        I should have told her how rude I thought she was being in the moment,
        but I didn't. So, yeah...


        PRO TIP: Just take the rotten food off of the customers bill, don't act
        condescending like you're the only person that's ever eaten shrimp, &
        don't lecture customers about how you think they're dumb & wrong & don't
        know what their favorite sushi is supposed to taste like because they
        aren't the same race as you.


        Also, if you don't want people to love & appreciate eating food from
        your culture, don't work at a Japanese restaurant.


        We used to like this place, but we're never coming back because of this
        rude Hostess/Manager. Horrible customer service from her! Definitely not
        someone you want interacting with customers. She's so cringe.


        The waitresses & waiters were FANTASTIC! The rest of the meal was
        fantastic as well. Thank you to all the staff EXCEPT the rude
        Hostess/Manager. YIKES.

        Went on a Saturday night place was almost empty. 1.5 prior to closing
        host took like 7 minutes to seat us she said we only had 15 min maximum
        to order because kitchen was shutting down . They close at 11pm ..
        Everyone looked lost not knowing which plate was going to which table.
        Running food to wrong tables and the servers in white T shirts talking
        down to busboys or food runners . They should be more professional when
        they are around people . Carlos G was apparently our server we tried to
        order food with him he said no drink only . Okay !!! Then 10-15 minutes
        later the sever  in a white t shirt tall with glasses. By that time 30
        minutes had gone by the time our food got to the table 10:35pm last dish
        was dropped . Had to rush they kept pushing and rudely feeling forced to
        eat 2 sushi plates a yakisoba to large beers and saki in under 30 min …
        Geez if only the 1st server would’ve gotten our food order that would’ve
        mattered . And the sushi rolls are a completely different portion that
        the rolls at the WEST HOLLYWOOD LOCATION!!! but same price . If I
        would’ve had enough time I could’ve taken pictures unfortunately that
        wasn’t the case so pretty much got kicked out was told to leave because
        it was closed . All I needed was an extra 10 minutes I was forced out by
        11:03 pm … Bad service . Alright food . I suggest you go to the WEST
        HOLLYWOOD LOCATION AND you will definitely see the difference . Little
        do they know I work in the hospitality industry and this is not how u
        close a restaurant you wait politely for guest to finish eating . You
        could have done your side work while people finished eating. Never going
        back… 1st and last . This is not proper hospitality.
