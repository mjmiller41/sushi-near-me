        It was an unbelievably excellent meal. From start to finish. The staff
        was so kind and attentive. And the food was so good. The cuts of fish
        were beautiful and perfect. They have a lot of high-end deliciousness.
        Enso Sushi is a great place to go if you want to have an elevated
        Japanese meal. I loved my Lobster miso and they had Toro and the most
        beautiful cuts from excellent sushi chefs. They went above and beyond to
        give us an amazing meal. The Miso black cod was delicious as well. And I
        have had that dish at Nobu and I also make a delicious miso glaze as
        well haha. But the fish was melt in your mouth. The only thing that I
        would even have a teensy tiny suggestion about would be the
        accoutrements for the cod didn't really match the flavor profile in my
        opinion but the green beans and tomatoes were still good, they just felt
        a little out of place. And the ice cream at the end was a little hard.
        I'm not even really complaining just because a lot of Japanese
        restaurants don't even bother to have a desert on the menu so I really
        appreciate that as an option however the ice cream and mochi we're
        frozen a little bit harder than would be ideal. If you are really
        serious about dessert you would have a special freezer that is set a
        little bit lower so that is definitely asking a lot I know most
        restaurants don't have separate freezers just for their ice cream so no
        worries haha. But I personally would probably skip the fried ice cream
        next time and my daughter isn't too picky about the mochi but it was
        hard as well. However like I said a lot of Japanese restaurants don't
        even offer dessert so I'm grateful to have options and they will satiate
        a sweet tooth if you have one at the end of your meal. All in all the
        fish was to die for. The presentation was beautiful. The staff was kind
        and so fast to put in our orders and get our food. And the sushi chefs
        did an impeccable job with beautiful cuts for those fish. I would eat
        that everyday if I could haha. Highly recommended to anyone who has
        taste buds. If you have never had Japanese food you should give it a
        whirl because it is one of the best cuisines in the world. And Enso
        Sushi and Grill is a great place to try it out. Also recommended for
        fans of fine dining. Their food is outstanding.

        It was an unbelievably excellent meal. From start to finish. The staff
        was so kind and attentive. And the food was so good. The cuts of fish
        were beautiful and perfect. They have a lot of high-end deliciousness.
        Enso Sushi is a great place to go if you want to have an elevated
        Japanese meal. I loved my Lobster miso and they had Toro and the most
        beautiful cuts from excellent sushi chefs. They went above and beyond to
        give us an amazing meal. The Miso black cod was delicious as well. And I
        have had that dish at Nobu and I also make a delicious miso glaze as
        well haha. But the fish was melt in your mouth. The only thing that I
        would even have a teensy tiny suggestion about would be the
        accoutrements for the cod didn't really match the flavor profile in my
        opinion but the green beans and tomatoes were still good, they just felt
        a little out of place. And the ice cream at the end was a little hard.
        I'm not even really complaining just because a lot of Japanese
        restaurants don't even bother to have a desert on the menu so I really
        appreciate that as an option however the ice cream and mochi we're
        frozen a little bit harder than would be ideal. If you are really
        serious about dessert you would have a special freezer that is set a
        little bit lower so that is definitely asking a lot I know most

        not cheap but you're paying for quality in a landlocked state.

        Enso Sushi is delightful! From the moment I walked in the door Alex the
        host and server was attentive, friendly, and very helpful when it came
        to ordering! Food is delicious! The fish is some of the best sushi I've
        had and there are things on this menu that are unique and special I
        think to this place alone. My husband and I got there plenty early which
        was great because it did fill up fast! If you've never been here you
        must go! Enjoy your fish-tastic experience!!😘
