        Takara Sushi is such a gem! Itâs a small restaurant, which adds to its
        unique charm and cozy ambiance. I didnât need a reservation, and
        honestly, I think this place is underrated, this was my second time
        eating here!


        The sushi rolls and appetizers were fantastic! We started with the baked
        eggplant appetizer topped with shrimpâabsolutely deliciousâand the
        wok-tossed edamame with garlic, which was packed with flavor.


        For the rolls, we ordered the SF roll and the Pink Dragon roll. The SF
        roll was beautifully presented with crispy flakes and tobiko, and the
        spicy tuna had the perfect balance of heat (kind of mild) and texture,
        it was definitely a standout dish!

        The Pink Dragon roll was baked and served in foil, with a mild yet
        flavorful spicy dressing that complemented the salmon perfectly.


        Highly recommend Takara Sushi for anyone looking for excellent food and
        last but not least, AMAZING service!

        I was told about Takara Sushi SF by a friend who lives here in SF.
        Really glad we made it here! Upon entering we were greeted with smiles
        and great energy. We ordered Miso soup to start. They immediately
        brought us out tables to accommodate our party. Menus and specials were
        introduced and explained to us. High quality fish imported A5 Japanese
        Wagyu. I was super excited to be eating here! I will definitely be
        returning here!

        Really enjoyed the two specialty rolls and salad. They offer a
        non-alcoholic beer too that was perfect for dry January. Good service
        too. We friend and I didn't feel rushed.

        Creative and delicious sushi rolls and equally tasty sushi specials at
        prices so reasonable it's hard to believe it's in San Francisco. Both
        special rolls we ordered were fantastic and presented artistically, and
        the nigiri was excellent, the rice just flavorful enough to complement
        the fish. The place is tiny, but we got seats at the bar, which is nice.
        Only downside was the intermittent service. Certainly worth coming here
        for sushi if you're in the Castro.

        This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city! Amazing sushi
        quality, great servings, friendly staff, its such a great spot.
        Highlightable items to try are the garlic edamame which comes out in
        it's own little skillet with thinly sliced garlic cooked in - amazing!
        You should also try the Pumpkin Roll - there is no pumpkin, only fish
        fabulousness. You only get two pieces, but it is worth it.
