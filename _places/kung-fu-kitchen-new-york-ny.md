        Had an incredible meal at this Chinese spot—an absolute gem! The
        dumplings were perfectly juicy and bursting with flavor, easily some of
        the best I’ve had. The starters were delicious across the board, each
        one packed with bold, authentic tastes. The hand-cut noodles and ramen
        were amazing —rich, comforting, and perfectly cooked with just the right
        amount of chew. Every dish felt crafted with care and tradition. Highly
        recommend if you’re craving real, delicious Chinese food that hits all
        the right notes!

        This was close to our hotel so we thought we would give it a go. It’s a
        no for us. Service was slow and not overly friendly. Restaurant shows
        its age and could use a good refresh. Front window is broken with a sign
        saying don’t touch. The appetizers were good, pan friend dumplings and
        scallion pancakes. The main dishes were very bland. Noodles were super
        chewy. There are better choices not far away.

        A hidden 💎 Michelin star restaurant. Sadly, I did not get to try their
        famous pork soup dumplings. I really wanted to try the hand cut noodles.
        I had the fatty Angus beef w/ chili oil. My husband had the house
        noodles. (Sorry, I can't remember the exact names, but something similar
        to this) The Schichuan crispy pork made an awesome pairing with my
        noodle soup (since I am considering this a side dish).  The food was
        exquisite!! A perfect balance of savory and fatty flavors. A must try
        place for the cold season.

        This was the best Chinese food restaurant experience I have ever had. I
        got the pork soup dumplings and the shredded beef and peppers dish. Both
        were excellent. The shredded beef with peppers was wonderfully spicy but
        not overpowering.  The service was good, quit and courteous. The food
        came within 10 minutes of ordering, with the pork soup buns coming a few
        minutes later.   It was cool but also somehow strange to have 80s rock
        and roll playing in the soundtrack while eating the most amazing Chinese
        dishes.  Come expecting excellent food but not a traditional Chinese
        ambience.  It was not a negative, it was just a bit surprising

        Service was just ok, borderline awkward. That’s fine the dumplings were
        good! But they didn’t want to give us extra chili oil sauce when
        requested, telling us “it’s really hot” and then ignoring our request. I
        know I’m a white girl, but I like it hot. So that was weird. And the
        ramen we ordered was just ok. But my spicy beef had a sour taste to it,
        I’m just hoping it wasn’t bad, and I will update it I get sick! We had
        to ask for the chili sauce again to add flavor, but it really could have
        used something else to add to it. Just ok in general. Not expensive. But
        I wouldn’t really want to return.
