        Went to celebrate my daughter’s big day with her! This is one of my
        favorite neighborhood restaurants. Master Chef Ohyama is a true sushi
        artist, crafting sushi that is both stunning and delicious. We always
        opt for the sushi omakase at the counter so we can watch him work his
        magic. Service was warm and attentive. If I ever won the lottery, I’d be
        here every week without question!

        Edit:


        Restaurant called me to make things right and apologized for the
        experience. I think the sea urchin was ultimately the culprit. In good
        conscience, I can't entirely overlook the quality control, but also I
        don't want to subjugate the place to something that may have been an
        honest error or out of their hands, especially given the customer
        service. Thus, revising to a 3/5.


        ---

        Original:


        Ordered the Sashimi and Sushi Premium Omakase. Tasted great, but got
        food poisoning a few hours later. For $180+tax+tip per person, I got to
        say... this was a huge letdown. Not worth the gamble, and there are
        other Omakase places I've been to for cheaper that tasted as good or
        better and didn't make me sick. Sad.


        Service was great, and ambiance was also good. Location is alright, not
        the best. If the food didn't make me sick, I'd have given this place a 5
        star review.

        Good food, if you get counter omakase the chefs make it in front u and
        you eat it 1 by 1. The fish are fresh and tasty. Price is about 100-180
        per person for omakase. There are a variety of sushi in the omakase
        combo and each tastes are unique. Over all good experience.

        Best sushi I've ever had. Be sure to try the fatty tuna. Absolutely
        worth it. Dessert was just as good. Fried ice cream and creme brulee
        were the perfect treat to the end of a delightful meal. Service was very
        good. We stayed until close and they cleaned absolutely everything.

        It was an incredible experience. The chef was very attentive and so was
        his supportive staff. The quality was amazing. Cannot recommend more. I
        did the Highest option of Omakase and it was reasonable, and to be
        honest the best sushi I have ever had. Albeit I’m new to Omakase however
        I’ll never forget my first time…
