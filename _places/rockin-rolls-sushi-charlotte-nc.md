        For a sushi gourmet this is not the place, very mediocre taste. The idea
        is really cool, and that’s what attracts people here. It is “All you can
        eat”, including the ordered food from the pad at the table. I liked that
        the portions are small so you can try different. The atmosphere is a bit
        more on the cheap canteen style. Service is good, fast, responsive, they
        come to your table and pick up your little plates regularly.

        Despite the fact that some aspects feel cheeper than others, this place
        excel in sushi, the one hour drive to get here was worth it and I loved
        ever second of it.

        Fun sushi eatery with plenty of options. I’ll say the desserts aren’t
        good at all. Purely my opinion but i wouldn’t waste time on desserts and
        concentrate on what’s actually good.


        My wife is a fan of the tofu and other vegetarian options as well. She’s
        a huge fan of the teriyaki veggies.


        Personally I think it’s a bit pricey, but my wife is a huge fan. Happy
        wife happy life😁.


        My favorite was the teriyaki steak. The rice rounded that out perfectly.

        I came here by myself since I had a craving for AYCE sushi. Their lunch
        deal is nice. While their quality isn't as amazing as if you were to
        order a la carte, I was still able to enjoy my food and leave full and
        happy.


        You get the options of not only sushi, but appetizers, and hibachi. I
        did not try the hibachi but it looks good. The shumai and the shrimp
        tempura were really good appetizers I tried. I loved that it was
        revolving sushi style so in case you don't want to talk to people, good
        for that.


        Parking lot is next to store and little walks away. It is the rocky
        parking lot so be aware of that. There is street parking but you have to
        pay and it may be all taken.

        This is a fun experience to try different varieties of sushi. There are
        about 10-15 varieties of sushi that goes around the belt, along with
        cucumber salad, seaweed salad, edamame, and 2 varieties of cake. Portion
        sizes are small, so you can try different varieties. Taste was mediocre.


        From the tablet, you can order apps- vegetable spring rolls, vegetable
        tempura, beef dumplings, crab rangoon. Kids menu- chicken nuggets,
        fries, corn dog. Entree - small plates of white rice and fried rice
        along with hibachi steak/chicken/shrimp/vegetables.


        Lunch is $13.99 per person and dinner is $17.99 per person. The orders
        from the tablet are brought to the table quickly and they come regularly
        to pick up the plates. This was a good one time experience for me, but
        given the price and food options, I’d rather go for a Chinese buffet
        than this sushi belt experience.
