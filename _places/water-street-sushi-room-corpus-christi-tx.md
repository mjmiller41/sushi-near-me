        Came in for lunch and overall I'd say it was an enjoyable experience.
        The food was really good (a bit pricey, but still good). Our server was
        friendly. My only complaint was the wait time was a bit long... I get
        that it's sushi and it can take awhile to make fresh, but I felt the
        wait time was a bit long. I only mention this because we were the only
        guests in the restaraunt at the time. Other than that its a good place
        to grab a lunch.

        The ambience and atmosphere were very nice along with the staff. Happy
        Hour is daily from 3-6. We ordered the Volcano roll (originally $19) a
        Spicy Salmon Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll along with Tuna and Salmon Nigiri
        which are not on the happy hour menu. The quality of the fish is pretty
        solid for South Texas and was impressive. However, the sushi rice was a
        bit hard making the sushi dry. We were able to get the Volcano roll for
        $9.5 which is fair but $19 being the original price is pretty wild.
        Overall the experience was solid during happy hour and if you’re in the
        area craving sushi. I’m sure the other seafood options at Water Street
        are good quality.

        Most creative rolls I have ever had… will be back for sure.  Eco lab
        washers are a plus and make sano cleanup work for sanitation of glasses
        and dishes.

        Best seafood in town and acceptable prices, sort of. But compared to
        other restaurants in the area, the oysters, shrimp, and fish are fresh
        guaranteed. Make sure you ennjoy 1/2 price off on oysters on half shell
        and sushi (dine in). Nice atmosphere, friendly staff. Sarah was my
        friend at the bar and she's been graceful and answered my questions with
        great info. Great chef; the caliente soup was excellent with health
        loaded ingredients. Loved it! It continues to be my favorite in spite of
        shrunken space and hiked up prices...

        The outside ambience is charment=charming!

        Take a few minutes to walk around and look at the oyster wall at the
        bar. Enjoy!
