        We come here every other Friday, and every single time, it has been our
        favorite sushi spot! The food tastes amazing, the presentation is cute
        and the employees are so kind and you can tell they stay on it with
        their customers.  This is our new sushi spot and we are so happy we
        found it!

        We started with seaweed salad and shrimp tempura, both excellent. The
        sushi rolls are awesome! We tried Utah, Wasatch, Spicy Tuna and
        something else I can't remember but they were all very tasty. The
        service was quick and friendly. The place is nothing fancy, just a
        smallish place in a strip mall but neat and clean.

        I like this place a lot but my fiance doesn't anymore. After our last
        visit, she got pretty sick, and it seems the noodles she got were to
        blame.

        The rolls here are really good and for a good price, and their
        appetizers are good, too. Unfortunately, though, they don't light any of
        their rolls on fire, which are my favorite ones. The service is usually
        really good, but at our last visit, they were really slow at getting
        stuff out that my fiance and I basically ate separately while together.

        The atmosphere is nice, no complaints there.

        Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good sushi
        at a decent price, but I would recommend avoiding the noodles.

        Really great food with awesome service. When this new place gets found
        out it is going to be packed. There are so many sushi rolls to meet any
        flavor preference as well as other dishes. My wife had the yellow
        chicken curry and it was honestly insanely good! You got to check this
        place out and it has a beautiful view of the Wasatch out the window. We
        will be back!

        I ordered a bento with some changes because I don't eat meat and I'm
        allergic to avocado. They kindly gave me a replacement.


        I can't say I enjoyed the taste of the food. The rice was like porridge
        in places. It felt like they mixed new and old rice. For some reason,
        the miso was brought first, although it should be served with the bento.


        Initially the staff seemed polite, but during lunch they came up to me
        and put the bill down, as if hinting that it was time for me to leave,
        although I spent about 30 minutes there in total. And after that the
        girl kept walking past me looking to see if I had finished eating or
        not.


        I don't recommend this place, but the choice is yours. Personally, I
        won't go there again.


        The takoyaki were topped with some kind of overly sour mayonnaise, so I
        still have this unpleasant taste in my mouth (2 hours later).

  What Customers Are Saying$$$Folks generally rave about the tasty sushi rolls
  and appetizers at this spot, highlighting how the fresh flavors and creative
  presentations make every meal feel special. Many appreciate the quick,
