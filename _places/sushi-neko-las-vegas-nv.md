        Amazing all-you-can-eat sushi experience! 🍣✨


        For just $30, you can eat as much as you want—and what truly amazed me
        was the incredibly fast service and outstanding quality of the food.
        It’s honestly impressive!


        I highly recommend coming around 3-4 PM when there’s little to no wait.
        After 5 PM, expect a line.


        Every meal here has been delicious, but my top recommendation is the Be
        Happy Roll—an absolute must-try!

        I visited Sushi Neko recently, and while the experience wasn’t bad, it
        didn’t quite live up to the hype. The sushi was fresh, but the flavors
        were fairly ordinary compared to other all-you-can-eat sushi places I’ve
        tried. The variety on the menu was decent, but nothing really stood out
        as exceptional.


        One nice touch is that they provide a small cake for birthday
        celebrations, which is a thoughtful gesture. However, aside from that,
        the overall experience felt average. The service was okay—neither
        particularly attentive nor inattentive. The ambiance was comfortable but
        nothing remarkable.


        Overall, it’s a decent spot for casual dining and celebrations, but it
        didn’t leave a lasting impression.

        This is 1 of my go to sushi spots.   It’s located in China town and it’s
        busy.   I was in the area yesterday at lunch time so I stopped by and
        got right in .  I was by myself but had decent availability.

        Sushi is always fresh.   Service is always prompt.  And food was
        great.   They always have some good music playing but not to loud for a
        conversation.


        I love this place!!

        YUMMMMMM! This was recommended twice by people we met during our stay in
        Vegas.


        We did the AYCE option and it was well worth every single penny! I was
        really impressed with all the “specials/one per person” items they had.

        Well, this was a complicated visit today. On one hand the food was
        generally good. On the other hand, they served me a really bad dish and
        the manager argued about it. I was not arguing. When I say bad, the
        presentation was awful. They served me a spider roll with rice that was
        practically porage. Way over cooked. He assured me that was how they
        served it. I accept that. And I told him if you stand behind this and
        think it was a good product, I can't really complain. But he was so
        defensive and brought back the spider roll we ordered and left it on the
        table. I got pictures. Most of what we ordered was fine, but two dishes
        were complete failures. Meh, don't plan on going back. But, I see they
        seem popular. I found it on Google maps and tried it without reading any
        reviews. The place is really cool inside. Yay.
