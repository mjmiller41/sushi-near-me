        Went to The Moon for a dinner with the family. Got the unlimited Kbbq.
        The choices of meat were pretty good. The beef and pork were pretty good
        quality for a AYCE, and we especially loved the LA galbi, pork ribs, and
        pork jowl! The DIY sauce stand was nice, and you can even make your own
        appetizers! Didn’t get to try them but the concept seemed fun. The ice
        cream & shaved ice was very good too(the strawberry toppings were
        delicious)!

        Our server (the man in the glasses) was very nice and continuously asked
        if we wanted to order more and changed our grill pan whenever we asked.
        Will probably come again!

        However, the appetizers were a bit weak in my opinion. Although there
        was a nice selection to choose from, all of them tasted lackluster. The
        next time I visit, I’ll probably just stick with the meat.

        Went to The Moon for a dinner with the family. Got the unlimited Kbbq.
        The choices of meat were pretty good. The beef and pork were pretty good
        quality for a AYCE, and we especially loved the LA galbi, pork ribs, and
        pork jowl! The DIY sauce stand was nice, and you can even make your own
        appetizers! Didn’t get to try them but the concept seemed fun. The ice
        cream & shaved ice was very good too(the strawberry toppings were
        delicious)!

        Our server (the man in the glasses) was very nice and continuously asked
        if we wanted to order more and changed our grill pan whenever we asked.
        Will probably come again!

        However, the appetizers were a bit weak in my opinion. Although there
        was a nice selection to choose from, all of them tasted lackluster. The
        next time I visit, I’ll probably just stick with the meat.

        The absolute best AYCE hotpot place in the northeast. My husband and I
        travel down often from NYC JUST for this place! The food is so so fresh,
        with plentiful options, and seafood and a buffet included with the base
        price!! You won’t find this deal anywhere else — the freshness, variety,
        and quality for a very decent price! Highly, highly recommend!!!

        I got the hotpot full moon. The broth is just the same thing you can get
        from any food market, not good at all. The sea food should still be good
        but not fresh.

        The most disappointing thing is the service here is really bad. The guy
        served my table is Korean and I’m not sure if he’s a racist or what but
        he will walk by our table and not even asking what we need but will
        serve other tables frequently. We asked for more broth which didn’t come
        at all. The meat were also coming really really slow every time  we
        ordered. Really bad experience.

        Had a great time at this Korean BBQ spot! The food was amazing, and
        Viviana was such a wonderful server—so kind and attentive. They even did
        a sweet little celebration for our friend’s birthday. Super thoughtful
        service all around. We’ll definitely be back!

        I would love to give the biggest shout out to my server Ana she was such
        a sweetheart and a blessing. She has a special sauce named Ana sauce and
        is was absolutely scrumptious!!! Ana was so kind and generous to my
        family. The food was mind blowing and the space was very clean and
        aesthetically pleasurable. My younger brother (who is autistic)
        especially enjoyed he was not too overstimulated. 100% recommend this to
        everyone!! 💕💕
